A rough sandy road runs down across the dark<lb facs="P5_TL00007"/>moors, into England on the one hand, and into Scotland on the<lb facs="P5_TL00008"/>other. It is a fine, starry night in early September. Daft Dick, a<lb facs="P5_TL00009"/>fantastic figure, in appearance half-gamekeeper, half tramp {dressed<lb facs="P5_TL00010"/>as he is in cast-off clothes of country-gentlemen) swings up the road<lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>from the Scottish side, singing.<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>" Now Iyiddisdale has ridden a raid;<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>But I wat they better hae stayed at hame ;<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>For Michael o' Winfield, he lies dead;<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>And Jock o' the Side is prisoner ta'en."<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>He stands for a moment, looking across the fells, which are very dark,<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>in spite of the starry sky ; then flings himself down in the heather,<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>with his back to the obelisk, and lights his pipe. Presently, he sees<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>a dark figure, stumbling with uncertain steps across the boggy moor;<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>and watches it keenly as it approaches, until it reaches the road, when<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>he sees that it is a strange man, evidently a tramp.<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>Tramp : A track, at last, thank God !<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>Dick : Aye, there be whiles<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>When beaten tracks are welcome.<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>Tramp: Who the . . . Oh!<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>I didn't count on having company<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>Again in this world ; and when I heard a voice<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>I thought it must be another ghost. It's queer<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>Hearing a voice bleat when you haven't heard<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>A mortal voice for ages. I've not changed<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>A word with a soul since noon ; and when you spoke<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>It gave me quite a turn. A feather, Iyord !<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>But it wouldn't take the shadow of a feather<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>To knock me over. I'm in such a stickle,<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>Dead-beat, and fit to drop. To drop ! I've dropped<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>A hundred times already, humpty-dumpty !</ab>

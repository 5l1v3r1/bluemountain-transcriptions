It is plain.<lb facs="P30_TL00009"/>Ail my activity is galhered into one part of itself, as though<lb facs="P30_TL00010"/>into one limb of my body ail my blood and growing strength<lb facs="P30_TL00011"/>had been forced. Then the body would faint, be pale and<lb facs="P30_TL00012"/>sick with the burden of the limb's hypertrophy. So does the<lb facs="P30_TL00013"/>maintainence of my soul depend upon a harmony of ail the<lb facs="P30_TL00014"/>free activities of a living man. That alone is freedom, and<lb facs="P30_TL00015"/>alone the condition of attaining some permanent spirit. Per<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P30_TL00016"/>sonal truth is the hypertrophied limb; it is the exaggeration<lb facs="P30_TL00017"/>of deliberate thought upon free living at the cost of free liv<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P30_TL00018"/>ing. If the limb will be sound and whole that we may lean<lb facs="P30_TL00019"/>upon it, then it must be an harmonious part of the living<lb facs="P30_TL00020"/>whole which is the body. Therefore deliberate thought upon<lb facs="P30_TL00021"/>the soul must be controlled intoits due place as a free act<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Its strength is the rapidly growing weakness of<lb facs="P30_TL00024"/>its fears ; and because they are weakencd, its strength is empty<lb facs="P30_TL00025"/>wind, the dropsy of decay.<lb facs="P30_TL00026"/>So the laborious définition of vague personal truth affects<lb facs="P30_TL00027"/>the soul.

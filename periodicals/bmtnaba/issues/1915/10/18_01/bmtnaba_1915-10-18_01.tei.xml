Yet if Igo down and sit by the Old Man,<lb facs="P27_TL00031"/>there will be no one to talk on the stage. Not the Angel nor<lb facs="P27_TL00032"/>Angela nor Adam — none of them will come on, unless I am<lb facs="P27_TL00033"/>there to push them.

                                    <lb facs="P29_TL00003"/>So I went, wondering whcther the Oltl Mail woulcl be<lb facs="P29_TL00004"/>there still on my return...<lb facs="P29_TL00005"/>Perhaps tlie interlude was too long. The Oid Man was<lb facs="P29_TL00006"/>no longer there when I returned. It is a pity, for now it<lb facs="P29_TL00007"/>seems empty to speak to an empty house. The words will<lb facs="P29_TL00008"/>not eome.<lb facs="P29_TL00009"/>It is in fact a pretty problem 111 Freedom. (I ara afraid<lb facs="P29_TL00010"/>Adam has been at me in the interval.) I want to go on, yet<lb facs="P29_TL00011"/>it is pain to me to go on ; and I stand on the edge of the<lb facs="P29_TL00012"/>stage shivering and tongue-tied. Somehow I have lost the<lb facs="P29_TL00013"/>thread of my oration. I cannot continue freely nor can I freely<lb facs="P29_TL00014"/>cease. The door is locked, bolted and barred. I cannot get<lb facs="P29_TL00015"/>outside ; I will not stay witliin,<lb facs="P29_TL00016"/>Inévitable that I should become feverish and talk about<lb facs="P29_TL00017"/>anything.<lb facs="P29_TL00018"/>I have read a book in the interval — a long book with<lb facs="P29_TL00019"/>a pertinent title : "Of Human Bondage." It is written by a<lb facs="P29_TL00020"/>man of whom I believe no more than he compels me to be<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P29_TL00021"/>lieve, The gist of the story is that a boy with a club<lb facs="P29_TL00022"/>foot, hait in soul, has ail the doors in life to open on to Free<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P29_TL00023"/>dom. There is no doubt that that is the right theme. We<lb facs="P29_TL00024"/>may treat that in différent ways according to our insight and<lb facs="P29_TL00025"/>our âge ; but there has ne ver been a novel which we within<lb facs="P29_TL00026"/>our hearts considered great, but was built according to<lb facs="P29_TL00027"/>that plan.<lb facs="P29_TL00028"/>And yet, I am not interested whether this young man<lb facs="P29_TL00029"/>wins or fails to win his freedom. Not for 011 e single moment<lb facs="P29_TL00030"/>has it mattered to me. Yet I should not wonder if Philip Carey<lb facs="P29_TL00031"/>(and his creator with him) should subscribe to ail that I have<lb facs="P29_TL00032"/>said about Freedom. Where then is the différence?<lb facs="P29_TL00033"/>For that he was bound captive to a despicable woman I<lb facs="P29_TL00034"/>despisehim; yet then, might he not be free ? Or is my des -<lb facs="P29_TL00035"/>pite the measure of a man's capacity for freedom ? But he<lb facs="P29_TL00036"/>is not free. Are there then two kinds of freedom ?<lb facs="P29_TL00037"/>The freedom of the free man and the freedom of the<lb facs="P29_TL00038"/>slave these are two. The slave is defined by his bondage;</ab>

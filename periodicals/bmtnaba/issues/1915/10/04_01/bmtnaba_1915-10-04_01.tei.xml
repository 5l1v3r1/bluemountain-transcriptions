One more chain<lb facs="P28_TL00018"/>added to ail the chains of my own.<lb facs="P28_TL00019"/>And then I wonder : "What of those others ?" Surely they<lb facs="P28_TL00020"/>being of my kind, were tortured by these ideas. Surely, they<lb facs="P28_TL00021"/>too could not bear to look at death save with the courage of<lb facs="P28_TL00022"/>something achieved out of their lrves, And yet they died, and<lb facs="P28_TL00023"/>I suppose, died gladly. I do not understand it any more. I do<lb facs="P28_TL00024"/>not believe that they died gladly : either that or they were<lb facs="P28_TL00025"/>not of my kind. What were they then and how were they<lb facs="P28_TL00026"/>persuaded ?<lb facs="P28_TL00027"/>Two answers come into my mind. One is that they were<lb facs="P28_TL00028"/>kindled and caught up into the flame of passionate desire for<lb facs="P28_TL00029"/>war as war, which scorched me in those remote days when I<lb facs="P28_TL00030"/>waited feverishly for war to be declared, shouted ail night<lb facs="P28_TL00031"/>long with the crowds in the streets, called A bas les Allemands !<lb facs="P28_TL00032"/>outside the French Embassy, and stood for days together in<lb facs="P28_TL00033"/>a queue at the door of a recruiting-office waiting my turn to<lb facs="P28_TL00034"/>be enrolled. It may be so. Or perhaps, seeing as clearly as I<lb facs="P28_TL00035"/>what was the motive of their desire for life and what a waited<lb facs="P28_TL00036"/>them as soldiers, they chose to meet their death. I cannot<lb facs="P28_TL00037"/>believe that they imagined that they would come out alive.<lb facs="P28_TL00038"/>Then they were moved by a deeper passion than that</ab>

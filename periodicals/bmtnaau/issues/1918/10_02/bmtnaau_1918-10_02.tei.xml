But it has<lb facs="P2_TL00145"/>not one quality that is good about it.<lb facs="P2_TL00146"/>The theatre at present is just a<lb facs="P2_TL00147"/>pretentious place and is likely to foster<lb facs="P2_TL00148"/>pretention in those who frequent it.<lb facs="P2_TL00149"/>There has been a movement for<lb facs="P2_TL00150"/>several years among architects to give<lb facs="P2_TL00151"/>us theatres of a different form, using<lb facs="P2_TL00152"/>different material, with an attempt at<lb facs="P2_TL00153"/>what some call simplicity, and so forth.<lb facs="P2_TL00154"/>It began with Wagner, and it seems to<lb facs="P2_TL00155"/>be developing well.

These<lb facs="P2_TL00158"/>theatres get built somehow without<lb facs="P2_TL00159"/>inspiration and without a reason and<lb facs="P2_TL00160"/>are expressionless.

In<lb facs="P2_TL00170"/>Parma there is the theatre built by<lb facs="P2_TL00171"/>G. B. Aleotti and completed in 1619,<lb facs="P2_TL00172"/>called the n Teatro Farnese ". Perfect<lb facs="P2_TL00173"/>in splendour, without being a Perishable<lb facs="P2_TL00174"/>Theatre, without being a Durable<lb facs="P2_TL00175"/>Theatre, it is typical of all the best<lb facs="P2_TL00176"/>that should have survived in the present<lb facs="P2_TL00177"/>theatre but is rapidly disappearing. It<lb facs="P2_TL00178"/>has received the touch of genius from<lb facs="P2_TL00179"/>the man who built it. But genius is<lb facs="P2_TL00180"/>absent from the modern theatre — is<lb facs="P2_TL00181"/>not allowed to touch it into life — so<lb facs="P2_TL00182"/>who cares whether it endure or perish?<lb facs="P2_TL00183"/>Practical people should consider the<lb facs="P2_TL00184"/>enormous waste which goes on year<lb facs="P2_TL00185"/>after year, and should ask themselves<lb facs="P2_TL00186"/>whether, instead of it, they cannot<lb facs="P2_TL00187"/>see their way to have the Durable<lb facs="P2_TL00188"/>Theatre and the Perishable Theatre,<lb facs="P2_TL00189"/>without spending a penny more.

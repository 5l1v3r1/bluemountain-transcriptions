Hall states in his "Actors in Ancient Times " that one<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>♦<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>actor, (he calls this histrion an " actormanger " but does not explain<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>the meaning of the word), was so well off that he indulged his strange<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>temperament by destroying works of art which he had the good fortune<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>to possess for a time. &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>£? Altogether the history of the actor at that period was an interesting<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>one; and, in fact, Professor Wilkinsan the archeologist, who is at present<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>engaged in some excavating on the spot where formerly the old Haymar=<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>ket joined with Pall Mall, promises the Museum some interesting finds.<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>&amp; We are happy In being able to announce that Professor Wilkinsan<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>has promised to inform us of any particularly illuminating proofs in sup=<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>port of our doubts as to whether these old actors used hares' feet with<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>which to put on the rouge, and whether any statue of Heerbolt Dree<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>was erected,., and, if any, where. &amp;</ab>

All this debris, in falling from one end<lb facs="P32_TL00014"/>of the box to the other, passes over a certain number of gratings, and<lb facs="P32_TL00015"/>it is the cascade-like sound which these broken fragments make in falling<lb facs="P32_TL00016"/>from grating to grating, which simulates rain and which has given you<lb facs="P32_TL00017"/>for an instant the illusion. &amp; JZ? &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P38_TL00011"/>we spoke of scenery and costumes for the theatre. These were the<lb facs="P38_TL00012"/>conclusions of our conversation : &amp;<lb facs="P38_TL00013"/>« In general scenery ought to be of a tint favourable to the costumes<lb facs="P38_TL00014"/>which move before it as the scenery of Beutlier, which always tends<lb facs="P38_TL00015"/>more or less to dun colour and lets the stuffs of the dresses stand out<lb facs="P38_TL00016"/>in all their freshness. £? ■£? &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;■&amp;<lb facs="P38_TL00017"/>£? if the scene painter is obliged to forsake this indefinite and veryfa=<lb facs="P38_TL00018"/>vourable tone, if it is necessary for him to paint a hall red or yellow,<lb facs="P38_TL00019"/>or a tent white or a garden green, the actors ought in this case to take<lb facs="P38_TL00020"/>the precaution to avoid these colours in their costumes. If an actor with<lb facs="P38_TL00021"/>a red coat and green trousers walks across a red room, the upper part<lb facs="P38_TL00022"/>of his body disappears, and one only sees his legs ; if he walks in the same<lb facs="P38_TL00023"/>costume in a green garden, it is his legs which disappear, only the upper<lb facs="P38_TL00024"/>part of his body remains. I have seen an actor in a white coat and very<lb facs="P38_TL00025"/>dark trousers who thus disappeared half way in standing against a white<lb facs="P38_TL00026"/>tent or a dark background. And even when the scene painter represents<lb facs="P38_TL00027"/>a red or yellow room, or grass, he ought always to keep his tints rather<lb facs="P38_TL00028"/>low and aerial, so that the costumes can harmonise v/ith them and pro*<lb facs="P38_TL00029"/>duce their effect. *&amp;</ab>

In painting, in<lb facs="P50_TL00006"/>sculpture, and in literature, the modern Japan has nothing but the<lb facs="P50_TL00007"/>juxtaposition of these two elements. And this juxtaposition is most mar«<lb facs="P50_TL00008"/>ked in drama. Our most ancient and sacred drama is played side by side<lb facs="P50_TL00009"/>with the plays of Ibsen. 44 No " drama, the most characteristically Japa°<lb facs="P50_TL00010"/>nese and medieval, and of which I am going to speak presently at length,<lb facs="P50_TL00011"/>is played in the one corner of a street; and in the other, you see Shaw's<lb facs="P50_TL00012"/>plays reproduced without any modifications at all. We are looking for a<lb facs="P50_TL00013"/>genius who can assimilate these two heterogeneous elements into one<lb facs="P50_TL00014"/>new art that will be our national art. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P50_TL00015"/>I need not explain to you how we have tried, and still are trying, to<lb facs="P50_TL00016"/>reproduce plays of Ibsen and Shaw and other German and Russian plays,<lb facs="P50_TL00017"/>without much success. In order to reproduce these plays, our actors have<lb facs="P50_TL00018"/>first to become westernized, before they can impersonate the characters<lb facs="P50_TL00019"/>of the plays. This is almost an impossible task, and it is no wonder that<lb facs="P50_TL00020"/>the original charm and dignity of these plays that we get by reading<lb facs="P50_TL00021"/>them, are lost when they are reproduced on the Japanese stage. Thus<lb facs="P50_TL00022"/>44 Hamlet ", 44 Merchant of Venice ", " Doll's House ", and 44 Lonely<lb facs="P50_TL00023"/>Lives" were reproduced and ended in failure. One way that has been<lb facs="P50_TL00024"/>suggested to reproduce western plays on our stage is to translate the<lb facs="P50_TL00025"/>characters and the situations of these plays Into the corresponding Ja»<lb facs="P50_TL00026"/>panese characters and situations. But when we try to do this, we soon<lb facs="P50_TL00027"/>find that many customs and sentiments and even key phrases of the<lb facs="P50_TL00028"/>originals, are incompatible with our mode of life. When we eliminate these<lb facs="P50_TL00029"/>incompatibilities and reproduce the original plots in new Japanese set*<lb facs="P50_TL00030"/>tings, we scon find that, Instead of reproducing them, we are writing<lb facs="P50_TL00031"/>new plays. Nothing short of this will succeed. 44 Hamlet 44 Othello "<lb facs="P50_TL00032"/>and 44Monna Vanna " were presented with Japanese characters and in<lb facs="P50_TL00033"/>Japanese settings, but they failed, because the contents of the plays<lb facs="P50_TL00034"/>themselves were not modified at all. You see how it is Impossible to<lb facs="P50_TL00035"/>reproduce your plays on our stages successfully. The only things that<lb facs="P50_TL00036"/>we can learn from your drama, I think, are its technique and principle.<lb facs="P50_TL00037"/>And even the technique and principle of your drama must be carefully</ab>

These dances were, for the most part, played before the<lb facs="P51_TL00017"/>patriarchal fathers, to soften their sorrows or to celebrate their good<lb facs="P51_TL00018"/>fortunes, especially after a triumphal battle. They were merely a part of<lb facs="P51_TL00019"/>the entertainment of these occasions and have nothing to do with the<lb facs="P51_TL00020"/>Japanese drama that developed later in our history. About two thousand<lb facs="P51_TL00021"/>years ago, Japan began to communicate with China through Korea.<lb facs="P51_TL00022"/>This intercommunication, as it became more frequent and active, brought<lb facs="P51_TL00023"/>to us the civilizations of India, China and Korea, their arts and religions.<lb facs="P51_TL00024"/>Their religions were, of course, Buddhism, different in some details, but<lb facs="P51_TL00025"/>the same in their main spirits. Their arts were more varied ; but the<lb facs="P51_TL00026"/>one that suited most to our national taste and is still preserved is<lb facs="P51_TL00027"/>44 Bugaku ". 44 Bugaku " is not a kind of drama, It is a kind of dance. It<lb facs="P51_TL00028"/>is our oldest theatrical art. I think that it originated in India, but before<lb facs="P51_TL00029"/>it was introduced to us through China and Korea, it must have been<lb facs="P51_TL00030"/>modified to a great extent.

I think that it is not<lb facs="P51_TL00033"/>too much to say that, when it was at its best, it was the most delicate<lb facs="P51_TL00034"/>art that the world has seen. There are about two hundred dances of this<lb facs="P51_TL00035"/>kind. One represents eight white storks alighting on a sacred mountain<lb facs="P51_TL00036"/>of India. Another represents an old Chinese patriarch dancing alone<lb facs="P51_TL00037"/>carried by the spirit of wine. Another is the dance of four Japanese</ab>

As these<lb facs="P52_TL00012"/>dances were played in the shrine before the altar, no special background<lb facs="P52_TL00013"/>was used. 1 said that they were the most favourite court dances. Soon<lb facs="P52_TL00014"/>they became the sacred dances played only as a ceremony to our ancestral<lb facs="P52_TL00015"/>spirits in their shrines. In other words, Bugaku became a sacred art. The<lb facs="P52_TL00016"/>vulgar could not see it easily, and it was utterly Impossible for them to<lb facs="P52_TL00017"/>learn it. It is so even now.

And<lb facs="P52_TL00020"/>when we think that even now we can see it, though very rarely, we<lb facs="P52_TL00021"/>ought to be grateful for our unchanged imperial dynasty that has<lb facs="P52_TL00022"/>preserved it.<lb facs="P52_TL00023"/>&amp; "Bugaku" is as 1 said, the oldest Japanese theatrical art preserved to<lb facs="P52_TL00024"/>this day.

Two other arts that<lb facs="P52_TL00026"/>are much more dramatic than "Bugaku" have developed in our later history.<lb facs="P52_TL00027"/>They are "No" drama and "Kabuki" drama.

In the age of Hojo and Ashikaga, Japan was ruled not by<lb facs="P53_TL00006"/>emperors or by courtesans, but by warriors, by so-called Shoguns and<lb facs="P53_TL00007"/>their followers. The lives of the warriors of this age were especially<lb facs="P53_TL00008"/>hazardous and uncertain. The friends of yesterday became the enemies<lb facs="P53_TL00009"/>of today. They were never certain what the fortunes of tomorrow would<lb facs="P53_TL00010"/>■turn out to be. Their lives were in constant danger. Living under such<lb facs="P53_TL00011"/>circumstances, they were naturally attracted by the religion that taught<lb facs="P53_TL00012"/>that life is a dream and deed is vanity; that salvation consists in freeing<lb facs="P53_TL00013"/>your soul from the chain of existence. It is also natural that they found<lb facs="P53_TL00014"/>Katharsls of their motions in " No" drama that was based upon the<lb facs="P53_TL00015"/>teaching of Buddhism.

Moreover, this pessimistic<lb facs="P53_TL00022"/>drama is monotonous. The same plot and the same thought run through<lb facs="P53_TL00023"/>its three hundred plays. Further, its dialogue consists of old Chinese and<lb facs="P53_TL00024"/>Japanese sayings patched up hap-hazard. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P53_TL00025"/>%<lb facs="P53_TL00026"/>£/ Though the works of these 44 No " writers are not very valuable for<lb facs="P53_TL00027"/>us, the ways in which these plays are presented are very instructive. At<lb facs="P53_TL00028"/>present, they are often played in the evening on a stage lighted by gas<lb facs="P53_TL00029"/>or electricity. But until several years ago, they were played only in day<lb facs="P53_TL00030"/>time. Having developed out of a kind of 44 Bugaku " that was played in<lb facs="P53_TL00031"/>the shrines, 44 No " drama, like Bugaku is presented on a stage that has<lb facs="P53_TL00032"/>no background and no curtain.

You see that this art, though pessimistic, as are all<lb facs="P56_TL00013"/>arts influenced by Buddhism, is an art especially designed for warriors,<lb facs="P56_TL00014"/>and its masculine character not only excluded women from taking part<lb facs="P56_TL00015"/>in it, but also suffused dresses and other small furnitures with masculine<lb facs="P56_TL00016"/>colour. The colour of dresses is sometimes gold or even red ; but its red<lb facs="P56_TL00017"/>and gold are not feminine. Their brilliancy is subdued by the so-called<lb facs="P56_TL00018"/>No" tone, and kept within masculine dignity. The same subdued tone<lb facs="P56_TL00019"/>that appears in the colour appears also in characters of plays, who laugh<lb facs="P56_TL00020"/>before death, and do not show tears when they weep.

"No", then, was the<lb facs="P57_TL00006"/>art exclusively for warriors. " Bugaku " having become the sacred art<lb facs="P57_TL00007"/>of the court and 44 No " having been appropriated by the warriors, the<lb facs="P57_TL00008"/>vulgar turned to a new art, which has developed since the seventeenth<lb facs="P57_TL00009"/>century, about three centuries after the rise of 44 No " art.

As you remember, there was a close relation between " Bugaku " and<lb facs="P57_TL00015"/>'• No " arts ; but " Kabuki" has no relation at all with 44 Bugaku ". Its<lb facs="P57_TL00016"/>relation with 44 No ", is, however, very close. Early 4* Kabuki " plays<lb facs="P57_TL00017"/>were played on the stage that was almost the same as the stage of 44N0<lb facs="P57_TL00018"/>drama. The plays themselves were similar to the "Kyogen". But to these<lb facs="P57_TL00019"/>44 Kyogen's " were added local dances which were played with the music<lb facs="P57_TL00020"/>of 44 Samisen ", the Japanized instrument of the Chinese Dablsen imported<lb facs="P57_TL00021"/>at that time. 44 Kabuki ", then was something of the nature of your<lb facs="P57_TL00022"/>musical comedy. By the way, a very interesting fact is that the author<lb facs="P57_TL00023"/>of 44 Kyogen ", the prototype of 44 Kabuki ", was a woman called Okuni.<lb facs="P57_TL00024"/>Before her, many women, no doubt, danced and sang in private banquets<lb facs="P57_TL00025"/>but Okuni was the first woman who, assisted by her followers, exhibited<lb facs="P57_TL00026"/>her art before public.

But as this drama<lb facs="P58_TL00022"/>developed more and more, aided by the genius of Chicamatso and others,<lb facs="P58_TL00023"/>its stage also developed into something very different from the stage of<lb facs="P58_TL00024"/>44 No " drama. In the later Kabuki-stage, there is no sandy place. The<lb facs="P58_TL00025"/>size of the stage Itself became twice or three times as large as that of<lb facs="P58_TL00026"/>the 44 No " stage. 44 Hashigakari " alone remains under a different name,<lb facs="P58_TL00027"/>Hanamichi (flower path). The earlier flower path led from the stage<lb facs="P58_TL00028"/>through the middle of the seats of the spectators into their back, which<lb facs="P58_TL00029"/>is very similar to the back of the pit of the English theatre. It is just<lb facs="P58_TL00030"/>like what Prof. Reinhardt tried in 44 Sumurun ". The later flower path<lb facs="P58_TL00031"/>however, leads through somewhat left of the middle line, and in many<lb facs="P58_TL00032"/>theatres, there is another narrower flower path leading through the seats<lb facs="P58_TL00033"/>of the spectators, some distance to the right of the middle line.

At present they are using the western curtain, but<lb facs="P59_TL00006"/>in the past, the curtain that Is drawn up and down was considered fit<lb facs="P59_TL00007"/>only for the second and the third rate theatres. When the curtain is<lb facs="P59_TL00008"/>drawn, the flower path is the only stage left; and we often see a player<lb facs="P59_TL00009"/>marching through it towards the back, after the curtain was drawn. The<lb facs="P59_TL00010"/>flower path is used not merely to go to or from the stage, but sometimes<lb facs="P59_TL00011"/>a very serious action is performed on it, and sometimes key passages of<lb facs="P59_TL00012"/>the whole play are uttered on it. &amp;<lb facs="P59_TL00013"/>£?

It is the volume abstracted by Secretary<lb facs="P4_TL00008"/>Harlan from Whitman's desk in the Interior Department and made the basis for<lb facs="P4_TL00009"/>Whitman's discharge from that branch of the service. An account of this incident,<lb facs="P4_TL00010"/>written by Whitman himself, will be photographically reproduced and<lb facs="P4_TL00011"/>included. The edition will be limited to five hundred copies. The price fixed<lb facs="P4_TL00012"/>ten dollars for each copy. No books will be sent to editors for review and no<lb facs="P4_TL00013"/>rebates or discounts will be allowed to collectors or booksellers.<lb facs="P4_TL00014"/>The text matter of this book will be printed from the original plates, which stil|<lb facs="P4_TL00015"/>exist. The chirographical matter in Whitman's hand will be superimposed. In order tp<lb facs="P4_TL00016"/>maintain a strict likeness to the original, in which Whitman used black ink and penc<lb facs="P4_TL00017"/>cils of several colors, it will be necessary for each sheet to go through the press from<lb facs="P4_TL00018"/>three to five times. This is a costly process.<lb facs="P4_TL00019"/>j0 The production of this work calls for the finest skill of the photographer, engraver<lb facs="P4_TL00020"/>and printer. But it wiil be faithfully supervised to the remotest particulars.<lb facs="P4_TL00021"/>Each volume will be authenticated by a number and my signature. Subscriptions<lb facs="P4_TL00022"/>will be filled in the order they are received.<lb facs="P4_TL00023"/>To persons who have a special Interest in Whitman, as well as to students and<lb facs="P4_TL00024"/>libraries (particularly to the libraries of schools and colleges), this remarkable reprint<lb facs="P4_TL00025"/>must have unusual significance.<lb facs="P4_TL00026"/>£7 No steps will be practically taken in this matter until subscriptions sufficient to<lb facs="P4_TL00027"/>cover the initial expenses are received Send for circular.

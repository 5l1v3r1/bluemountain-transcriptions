AH he was concerned about was<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>the loss of some Foreign works of Art belonging to some rich Lord<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>and painted centuries ago. £7 &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>£7 That is Snobbery tinged with Commercialism, and to blame the dealer<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>or to blame anyone except the mean-spirited Lord who lets such parts<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>of his furniture leave his house, is ridiculous. £7 £7<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>Then the modern custom of speaking of a picture by some master as<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>" the Carlisle Mabuse " or 44 the Lansdowne Rembrandt' " is vulgar and</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00003"/>could be easily avoided. It comes of course from looking on England as<lb facs="P16_TL00004"/>44 a store house of great artistic treasures ", one of Mr Asqulth's more<lb facs="P16_TL00005"/>unfortunate Inspirations. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00006"/>But the most unfortunate of all is where this fine statesman speaks<lb facs="P16_TL00007"/>of the works of Rembrandt and Mabuse as being examples of British art.<lb facs="P16_TL00008"/>Any man who spares the right amount of time to consider the question<lb facs="P16_TL00009"/>of Art and National Life knows full well that the nation would not be<lb facs="P16_TL00010"/>a jot worse off if every one of the old master-pieces went home to the<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>land of its creator. In fact the problem which Mr Asquith might try to<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>solve is, How to get rid of all the Foreign Works of Art. Perhaps the<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>way to do this would be to exchange our Italian, Spanish, Dutch and<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>French pictures for the English works now to be found in Continental<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>collections. ,6? &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>&amp; Mr Asquith's mistake at this Academy Banquet caused most of the<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>journals of the next few days to send up a kind of Guido Rent wall of<lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>despair, 44 Another Rembrandt for America gasped the<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>44 Observer ", generally a very clear-sighted journal. 44 What a drain<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>on the country, when is it all going to ?".<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>But why should it end until all the Foreign works have gone ? When<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>that time approaches English Art will begin to be appreciated in England<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>and English artists will be given fair play; not before. For this mania for<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>possessing Foreign works of art is the cause of the starvation of all<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>modern art, especially In England.<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>In America it Is almost as bad. American legislators should hound<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>down these dealers who import the works of Rembrandt and Mabuse.<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>The worst of it is that the whole matter is treated so amiably. Modern<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>artists have not protested : rather are they themselves nowadays becoming<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>collectors and dealers, JS?<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>This of course is quite contemptable, and I am happy to say I have<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>never yet come across a modern artist in the act of dealing in ancient<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>master pieces. I think 1 should knock him down.<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>Now doubtless having read thus far you feel that you know better<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>than we artists do and you tell us that we are perfectly right to be so<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>enthusiastic and you smile In an elderly fashion and you reserve your<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>trump card to the last. &amp;</ab>

And for this reason I sincerely wish that many<lb facs="P45_TL00024"/>of these admirable theatre directors would abstain from announcing<lb facs="P45_TL00025"/>t heir efforts for Reform, for, alas, it is very deceptive to the public. &amp;<lb facs="P45_TL00026"/>1 have written elsewhere (i) about the futility of us welcoming the<lb facs="P45_TL00027"/>co of the Salon~painter, for though in the House or the<lb facs="P45_TL00028"/>Sal on he fce ever so good, as Theatre collaborator he is useless for he<lb facs="P45_TL00029"/>b rings new complications to an already too-complicated problem.<lb facs="P45_TL00030"/>&amp; Added to this he is poaching on our preserves and it will not do to<lb facs="P45_TL00031"/>break down the old hedges which divide our different properties.

                                    <lb facs="P48_TL00008"/>7yir Jack B. Yeats plunders properly. He not only actually pretends to<lb facs="P48_TL00009"/>be a pirate; he is one. But he only goes for those of the Old Trade.<lb facs="P48_TL00010"/>And he's done the business so thoroughly that It seems as though he is<lb facs="P48_TL00011"/>destined to go down to posterity in Cassells' New Biographical Dictionary<lb facs="P48_TL00012"/>as the Last of the Pirates. &amp; &amp; &amp; ■£&gt; &amp;<lb facs="P48_TL00013"/>Most Bucaneers reach their prime at forty. Captain Yeats was in<lb facs="P48_TL00014"/>command at the age of six, and before he was twenty had scuttled the<lb facs="P48_TL00015"/>two most formidable vessels ever known on the High Seas. The "Pollock"<lb facs="P48_TL00016"/>and the " Reddington " were their names, it is said of them that as they<lb facs="P48_TL00017"/>cleft the vivid waters of the Ocean they left behind them a wake of<lb facs="P48_TL00018"/>cross°bones over which the moon grinned horridly in likeness of a skull.<lb facs="P48_TL00019"/>In their day they had many a fine haul, but none ever so rich as<lb facs="P48_TL00020"/>when they captured the " Skelt&amp; £r<lb facs="P48_TL00021"/>The fame of the " Skelt" still survives its destruction. The " Skelt"<lb facs="P48_TL00022"/>was a most daring vessel and over ten thousand bags of spangles were<lb facs="P48_TL00023"/>found in its hold when it lost the day to the " Pollock " and the</ab>

These spangles were once in the care of John Philip<lb facs="P49_TL00004"/>Kemble, the most gaudy Admiral, though the grandest, in His Majesty's<lb facs="P49_TL00005"/>Navy; but he came across the " Skelt" and was with his crew literally<lb facs="P49_TL00006"/>cut up into little bits. &amp;<lb facs="P49_TL00007"/>So you see Captain Yeats has every right to play at Pirates....for he<lb facs="P49_TL00008"/>knows how a Pirate must act.<lb facs="P49_TL00009"/>But if Captain Yeats,... now, alas, retired and become plain Mr Jack<lb facs="P49_TL00010"/>Yeats.... knows how to Rob he disdains to Imitate. His theatre is the<lb facs="P49_TL00011"/>theatre of Skelt, Pollock and Reddington, but his manner is his own.<lb facs="P49_TL00012"/>&amp; He does not splutter or pour the colours about without any reason<lb facs="P49_TL00013"/>but that its theatrically right. "Isn't it Piratically right?" asks Yeats;<lb facs="P49_TL00014"/>" Isn't it natural?". And, " I'll be a true Pirate" says he, " and then<lb facs="P49_TL00015"/>If possible I'll be natural ". &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P49_TL00016"/>His toy theatre is the most natural Europe possesses. His Dramas are<lb facs="P49_TL00017"/>filled with all the winds of Heaven. They are short, ....yet no one who<lb facs="P49_TL00018"/>reads them, no one who has seen them, but feels they are as long as Life.<lb facs="P49_TL00019"/>£? " The Scourge of the Gulph " is without exception quite the first<lb facs="P49_TL00020"/>drama of the century. You may think, Reader, that I exaggerate, that 1<lb facs="P49_TL00021"/>am carried away by these pirates,.... or that 1 am mad. But 1 have at<lb facs="P49_TL00022"/>least thirty nine good reasons which I could here put down 'twere it<lb facs="P49_TL00023"/>worth while, to prove logically that this Drama is without exception the<lb facs="P49_TL00024"/>♦<lb facs="P49_TL00025"/>first drama of the Century.<lb facs="P49_TL00026"/>In this masterpiece things happen. In Dramas of this century things<lb facs="P49_TL00027"/>don't happen,<lb facs="P49_TL00028"/>In " The Scourge of the Gulph " they happen quick... lightning goes<lb facs="P49_TL00029"/>slower. Drama must beat lightning at its only game. Mr Yeats beats it.<lb facs="P49_TL00030"/>£/ There was an Irish dramatist called Synge who I once thought knew<lb facs="P49_TL00031"/>something about movement. I now realize that by the side of Jack Yeats<lb facs="P49_TL00032"/>Synge becomes a dreamer.<lb facs="P49_TL00033"/>Synge was never able to thrill us by a mere stage direction. Synge<lb facs="P49_TL00034"/>never translated us a thousand miles in an instant as Yeats can with<lb facs="P49_TL00035"/>his one solemn line of scenic art, " Scene one ; 'The Deck of the Distant<lb facs="P49_TL00036"/>Land' ". Why, to have put that down just as it is settles his right to the<lb facs="P49_TL00037"/>Laurels. £? £? &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P49_TL00038"/>But wait! On the next line we read, "Captain L. H.

For It's not '* rather " anything.

It<lb facs="P60_TL00019"/>was rebuilt about thirty five years ago so it's not the same old English<lb facs="P60_TL00020"/>place as shown in the picture, but they say that the same old Scotch<lb facs="P60_TL00021"/>whisky is to be found there.<lb facs="P60_TL00022"/>&amp; Now that I've told you where and how to find the place I think I've<lb facs="P60_TL00023"/>done ail that is possible to do.

But then Dumas did triumph, for his novels and this<lb facs="P60_TL00028"/>Theatre are part and parcel of one another.<lb facs="P60_TL00029"/>jgr But what I can do is to tell you the names of the Dramas to be<lb facs="P60_TL00030"/>obtained, the sizes of the stages, their prices, and then you can do the<lb facs="P60_TL00031"/>rest.

Schure's work, a vindication of<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>the dignity of the Theatre, of its vital importance in the life of a people,<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>its incalculable influence, whether for good or evil, upon the entire<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>being of man, 44 sense, soul and mind " : a grave warning that, unless it<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>strive to rise to the best it must sink to the worst; and, if not 44 a<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>school of beputy, of truth and of rebirth", be inevitably 44 a school of<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>ugliness, of falsehood and of death J? &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>One thing which should be borne in mind in reading this essay of M.<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>Schure's is that it was written by him eleven years ago. Thus, when he<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>wrote that 44 one single man, In this century, has succeeded up to the<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>present time in demonstrating what the theatre of the future may be;<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>that is, Richard Wagner ", he was writing of the nineteenth century<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>and before the birth of that new movement in the European Theatre<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>in which he would doubtless be among the first to welcome eagerly the<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>very stirring of the wings of that Psyche whom he invokes; of that<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>progressive soul which, although it may look into the past to learn, does<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>not look there to Imitate, and which, Emerson asserts, never, just because<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>it Is progressive, 44 quite repeats itself, but in every act attempts the<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>production of a newer and fairer whole ;" sinpe, in our fine arts, 44 not<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>44 imitation, but creation, is the aim. In landscapes, the painter should<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>44 give the suggestion of a fairer creation than we know. The details, the<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>44 prose of nature he should omit, and give us only the spirit and splendour.<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>44 He should know that the landscape has beauty for his eye, because it</ab>

Will It be a pyschologist's surgical<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>operation or a poet's ecstasy? To all these questions one can reply by a<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>hundred hypotheses the one more ingenious than the other, but they will<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>be only hypotheses. One single man, in this century, has succeeded<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>up to the present time in demonstrating what the theatre of the future may<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>be ; that is Richard Wagner.

That is the<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>theatre desired by Mlchelet; it is that which M. Maurice Pottecher,<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>by a very noble initiative, is attempting to create today in the Vosges ;<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>that which Messieurs Le Franz and Le Goffic are attempting to restore<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>in Brittany by once more acting in the Celtic language the old Breton<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>Mystery plays. &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>¬£?

It will study contemporary reality with the<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>penetrating gaze of a keen observation and a profound sympathy. Of<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>this theatre Ibsen, Tolstoi, Hauptmann, Francois de Curel have already<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>furnished us with striking examples. &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>&amp; Finally there will be that Theatre of the elite which for the sake of<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>its essential medium one might call the Theatre of Dream,and which 1 call<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>the Theatre of the Soul on account of its inspiring element. JZ? JZ?<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>/Z? It will evoke a superior humanity in the mirror of history, of legend<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>and of symbol. That humanity will not be the less palpitating with life<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>and truth because it is ideal. Shakespeare has uttered this profound<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>word : " we are such stuff as dreams are made of ". But one can turn his<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>idea round and say, " Our dreams are made of the blood of our life;<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>they are the respiration and the aspiration of our souls." &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>This Theatre of Dream, this Theatre which will relate the supreme<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>work of the Soul in the legend of Humanity, will, I dare to say, be bold*<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>ly and profoundly religious. For it will attempt to unite the human to<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>the divine, to show in the terrestrial man a reflection and a sanction of<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>that transcendant world, of that Beyond in which we all believe under<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>different names, should it be but under the name of infinite sentiments<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>and eternal ideas. &amp; JZ? &amp;</ab>

So beautiful a picture has never been seen in<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>nature, any more than has a landscape of Poussin or Claude Lorraine<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>which seems to us very natural but which we seek in vain In<lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>reality ".<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>44 Are such bold traits of artistic fiction, analogous to this double<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>light of Rubens, found also in literature ?

Take<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>only 44 Macbeth ". When Lady Macbeth wishes to rouse her husband to<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>action she says, "I have given suck ". etc. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>Whether that be true or not matters little; Lady Macbeth speaks thus<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>and ought to speak thus to augment the effect of her speech ; but, in<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>the course of the play, Macduff, when he learns the disaster of his own<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>family, cries, in his violent fury, 44 he has no children ". These words<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>are in contradiction to those of Lady Macbeth. Shakespeare has not<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>troubled himself about it. He seeks but to give to each speech its full<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>force, and just as Lady Macbeth, to give full effect to her words, ought<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>to say, 44 1 have given suck to his children ", Macduff for the same<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>reason ought to say, 44 he has no children<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>&amp; 44 In general it is not with so much precision and minuteness that<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>1<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>one should examine the touches of a painter or the words of a poet; if<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>the work of art is the outcome of a free and bold spirit it is essential</ab>

It is because he has no enjoyment of beautiful things, no<lb facs="P22_TL00009"/>passionate love for the work of the men In the fine arts : because neither<lb facs="P22_TL00010"/>nature nof art moves him, but only the " theatrical " moves him. And he<lb facs="P22_TL00011"/>does not know how much he loses by this apathy. You and I, Urban, have<lb facs="P22_TL00012"/>often written about the old Engravers and have pointed out how valuable<lb facs="P22_TL00013"/>the study of their work is to the Theatre men, haven't we ? &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00014"/>Urban. &amp; We have, we.... &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00015"/>4?

                                    <lb facs="P27_TL00005"/>'-p HIS play takes up the history of the House of York in the summer<lb facs="P27_TL00006"/>of 1471 (the corse of Henry VI. not yet having been Interred) and<lb facs="P27_TL00007"/>finishes with the battle of Bosworth, August 22, 1485. Clarence was<lb facs="P27_TL00008"/>found dead in the Tower, February JB, 1478, having been committed only<lb facs="P27_TL00009"/>a month (January 16) before this. His brother, the Duke of Gloucester,<lb facs="P27_TL00010"/>had quarrelled with him about the Warwick estates as far back as 1473t<lb facs="P27_TL00011"/>and very much against the wish of Clarence had married the Princess<lb facs="P27_TL00012"/>Anne, Warwick's second daughter, and sister-in-law to Clarence. Now, in<lb facs="P27_TL00013"/>the drama, Clarence is committed to the Tower, follows the<lb facs="P27_TL00014"/>burial of the late King and the beginning of Richard's "courtship, and<lb facs="P27_TL00015"/>the first Act finishes with the death of Clarence. It is tolerably manifest<lb facs="P27_TL00016"/>that the action in this Act was only intended to cover the month which<lb facs="P27_TL00017"/>elapsed from the committal to the death of Richard's unfortunate brother<lb facs="P27_TL00018"/>for these two events meet us, one at the beginning, the other at the<lb facs="P27_TL00019"/>end, of the Act. In the short interval between them Henry VI. is buried<lb facs="P27_TL00020"/>and Richard does not marry " the lady Anne. " Surely Macbeth is quite<lb facs="P27_TL00021"/>as good history as this. The second Act begins on or about April 8, and<lb facs="P27_TL00022"/>ends Ma y2 or 3, 1483. The third Act begins May 4¬ª and ends June 26,<lb facs="P27_TL00023"/>1483. In both Acts the dramatic events are unfolded in true historical<lb facs="P27_TL00024"/>sequence. The year 1483 still follows us to the end of the first Scene of<lb facs="P27_TL00025"/>the fifth Act; then comes a break of nearly two years, and the rest of<lb facs="P27_TL00026"/>the Act belongs to the latter end of August 1485. Buckingham was<lb facs="P27_TL00027"/>beheaded at Salisbury November 1, 1483. and his ghost is one of the<lb facs="P27_TL00028"/>party who disturb Richard on the night before the battle of Bosworth.<lb facs="P27_TL00029"/>The taking of Buckingham on the (stage) field of battle, and the<lb facs="P27_TL00030"/>line<lb facs="P27_TL00031"/>Off with his head!-So much for Buckingham I<lb facs="P27_TL00032"/>which is always sure to bring down a round of applause, are not<lb facs="P27_TL00033"/>Shakespere's but the invention of later times, when historical blunders<lb facs="P27_TL00034"/>were less to, be excused than in Elizabeth's reign. It is hardly necessary<lb facs="P27_TL00035"/>to add that the character of Richard 111., as exhibited in the play, is as<lb facs="P27_TL00036"/>far from the truth as the arrangement of events in the first Act.

Scene 3).<lb facs="P28_TL00014"/>Salisbury. - An open place (Act v. Scene 1).<lb facs="P28_TL00015"/>We have then left nineteen Scenes in London and Westminster, which<lb facs="P28_TL00016"/>may be divided as follows : -<lb facs="P28_TL00017"/>A street i . 5<lb facs="P28_TL00018"/>Courtyards or open places . . 5<lb facs="P28_TL00019"/>Interior of the Palace ... 6<lb facs="P28_TL00020"/>Ditto Tower ... 3<lb facs="P28_TL00021"/>Ditto of Lord Stanley's house . 1<lb facs="P28_TL00022"/>Of the streets, we may remark that one (Act i. Scene 1) must lead<lb facs="P28_TL00023"/>to the Tower from Westminster ; another (Act i. Scene 3) from St Paul's<lb facs="P28_TL00024"/>to Chertsey; another (Act iii. Scene 1) must be in a <lb facs="P28_TL00025"/>direction; that which forms the third Scene of the second Act would<lb facs="P28_TL00026"/>most naturally be placed in the heart of the city; and the sixth Scene<lb facs="P28_TL00027"/>of the third Act might be the same, or it might very well come into<lb facs="P28_TL00028"/>the seventh Scene, the court of Baynard's castle. The street architecture<lb facs="P28_TL00029"/>of our English cities in the time of which I write was passing through<lb facs="P28_TL00030"/>those later phases that helped to bring about the ruin of northern art.<lb facs="P28_TL00031"/>Houses were built higher than ever, storey overhung storey until the<lb facs="P28_TL00032"/>gables were oftentimes within handshake distance; light and air<lb facs="P28_TL00033"/>were excluded in a measure we In these days can hardly realise. The<lb facs="P28_TL00034"/>growth of the population, the continued desire men still had to huddle<lb facs="P28_TL00035"/>together within the (doubtful) protection of crenellated walls, the<lb facs="P28_TL00036"/>lingering faith in city gates-(even yet hanging in rags and tatters about<lb facs="P28_TL00037"/>Temple Bar)-were the first weaknesses of a transition (and all transitions</ab>

Baynard's Castle stood in Thames Street, and one<lb facs="P29_TL00023"/>pile of the building stood on the very edge of the river. It was built by<lb facs="P29_TL00024"/>Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and had a half-and-half look about it,<lb facs="P29_TL00025"/>neither castle nor manor-house, but a look with an air of " the seven<lb facs="P29_TL00026"/>gables " in it, solemnified here and there by a strong turret of castle<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The main building was four storeys high, and the<lb facs="P29_TL00028"/>windows were small enough to show that its builder thought more of<lb facs="P29_TL00029"/>safety than of outlook. The fourth Scene of the fourth Act, " before the<lb facs="P29_TL00030"/>Palace ", should b4 an outer quadrangle or court-yard of the King's<lb facs="P29_TL00031"/>palace. The course of the action shows that Richard has joined his train<lb facs="P29_TL00032"/>in an inner court, from which he passes through a second or outer<lb facs="P29_TL00033"/>court wherein the two Queens and the Duchess of York have met to<lb facs="P29_TL00034"/>intercept him in his expedition. I take it that this outer palace would<lb facs="P29_TL00035"/>have some air of privacy about it, that it would be a quadrangle and<lb facs="P29_TL00036"/>not a street, or the Broad Sanctuary even, for it would be scarcely<lb facs="P29_TL00037"/>probable that queens and duchesses would sit on the ground of a public</ab>

The buildings might be in one or more<lb facs="P30_TL00006"/>styles provided there was nothing later than 1483. and this gives such<lb facs="P30_TL00007"/>a wide scope to the scenic artist that to go wrong is hardly possible<lb facs="P30_TL00008"/>*<lb facs="P30_TL00009"/>except of malice aforethought. Of the six scenes devoted to the interior<lb facs="P30_TL00010"/>of the palace, one is evidently intended to be distinct from the rest. A<lb facs="P30_TL00011"/>room of state must be provided for the second Scene of the fourth Act,<lb facs="P30_TL00012"/>but the third of the first and fourth, and the first, second, and fourth of<lb facs="P30_TL00013"/>the second Acts may be represented by the common hall, or any other<lb facs="P30_TL00014"/>room which, like this, would be easy of access to everyone.

I can find no such list either in<lb facs="P35_TL00005"/>Bartoli (i) or elsewhere. Probably no one has thought it worth while<lb facs="P35_TL00006"/>heaping the names together, but I hold another opinion. &amp;<lb facs="P35_TL00007"/>1 have arranged the list in alphabetical order. The nine principle<lb facs="P35_TL00008"/>masks I have printed in capital letters. Pour of these come from the<lb facs="P35_TL00009"/>north of Italy, four from the south, and as. for the one over, the Captain,<lb facs="P35_TL00010"/>half of him comes from Spain by ship and, arriving at Naples, finds his<lb facs="P35_TL00011"/>other half already in the Z? jZ&gt; z?

I have<lb facs="P35_TL00015"/>also included in the list names invented by the Germans, English or<lb facs="P35_TL00016"/>French such as Hanswurst (Germany) who is the Harlequin of France,<lb facs="P35_TL00017"/>the 44 Arlecchino " of Italy. z? z? z? z? z? zr<lb facs="P35_TL00018"/>z? Most of the names are very amusing to the ear, and some of them<lb facs="P35_TL00019"/>have queer meanings, such as, for example, 44 Capitano Grillo ". (2)<lb facs="P35_TL00020"/>The word Grillo means literally Grasshopper; but a Grillo is also a<lb facs="P35_TL00021"/>battering ram and a whim,.... two widely different meanings. Then idio=<lb facs="P35_TL00022"/>matically we have it in these senses ; 44 pigliare il grillo " ; to take pepper<lb facs="P35_TL00023"/>in the nose or to get in a rage; 44 fare saltare il grillo " to another<lb facs="P35_TL00024"/>person means to provoke them, or, in the English phrase, to 44 get their<lb facs="P35_TL00025"/>back up ".

" There were, at that time,<lb facs="P40_TL00013"/>not so many students poets of shintais, and as to-day;<lb facs="P40_TL00014"/>I had no small difficulty in hunting up their works in college publications<lb facs="P40_TL00015"/>of city and provinces.

" The<lb facs="P40_TL00017"/>May subject was announced in a letter again to be " A Collection of<lb facs="P40_TL00018"/>Japanese Proverbs containing Allusions to Buddhism. " As there was no<lb facs="P40_TL00019"/>such work published, 1 made my best effort in the Uyeno and University<lb facs="P40_TL00020"/>libraries, and the result was better than I expected at first, and I even<lb facs="P40_TL00021"/>thought that i had coliected all the proverbs in that line. Mr. Hearn<lb facs="P40_TL00022"/>was much pleased, and used the material for Japanese Buddhist<lb facs="P40_TL00023"/>Proverbs " in his "In Ghostly Japan."

And the result which 1 presented to Mr. Hearn to<lb facs="P41_TL00007"/>%<lb facs="P41_TL00008"/>his delight came to be used as the material for his " Literature of the<lb facs="P41_TL00009"/>Dead in " Exotics and Retrospectives* " The subject for September<lb facs="P41_TL00010"/>was the relation of sFuji Mountain and Shintoism; and my essay was<lb facs="P41_TL00011"/>utilised somewhere in " Fuji-no-yama " in the same book.

"<lb facs="P41_TL00021"/>*' Poems on Cicadas 'and Frogs " was the subject for December. The<lb facs="P41_TL00022"/>materials for them were considerable, especially for frogs ; I presented<lb facs="P41_TL00023"/>him also the translations of 44 Keichu Kushlu " and 44Zoku Keichu Kushiu"<lb facs="P41_TL00024"/>edited by the hokku poet Roseki Mizouchi. He was delighted with my<lb facs="P41_TL00025"/>work on the subject; his study on Frogs In his 44 Exotics and<lb facs="P41_TL00026"/>Retrospectives" relied on it. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P41_TL00027"/>The subject for January, 189s, was 44 Poems on the Sound of Sea<lb facs="P41_TL00028"/>and Wind. " It is strange even to us that we have very few such poems;<lb facs="P41_TL00029"/>he was surprised about that, of course, 44 About Incenses, and also the<lb facs="P41_TL00030"/>Poems on Them " was my February work which was used for his<lb facs="P41_TL00031"/>44 incense "In4&lt; In Ghostly Japan.

The subject for April<lb facs="P41_TL00035"/>was the 44 Buddhistic Conception of Hell " and chiefly, a description of<lb facs="P41_TL00036"/>it; and 1 tried my best with it, but he did not make any use of my<lb facs="P41_TL00037"/>effort which, however, pleased him.

You are good at your studies, and mentally in sound health, and<lb facs="P44_TL00027"/>steady In your habits...three conditions which ought to mean success,<lb facs="P44_TL00028"/>unless you fail in them. That is not unfortunate. ¬£?<lb facs="P44_TL00029"/>¬£? 44 Finally, you have good eyes and a clear brain. How many thousands<lb facs="P44_TL00030"/>have to fail for want of these ? You are certainly not unfortunate. &amp;<lb facs="P44_TL00031"/>44 When I was a boy of sixteen, although my blood-relations were....<lb facs="P44_TL00032"/>some of them... very rich no one would pay anything to help me finish<lb facs="P44_TL00033"/>my education. I had to become what you never have had to become,....<lb facs="P44_TL00034"/>a servant. I partly lost my sight. 1 had two years of sickness in bed. 1<lb facs="P44_TL00035"/>I<lb facs="P44_TL00036"/>had no one to help me. Yet 1 was brought up in a rich home, surrounded<lb facs="P44_TL00037"/>with every luxury of Western life. 4? &amp;<lb facs="P44_TL00038"/>* f.<lb facs="P44_TL00039"/>44 So, my dear boy, do not lie there in your bed and fret, and try to<lb facs="P44_TL00040"/>persuade yourself that you are unfortunate. You are a lucky boy, and a<lb facs="P44_TL00041"/>pet, and likely to succeed in life... " &amp;<lb facs="P44_TL00042"/>My thought of Mr. Hearn carried me back, [at once, to his beloved</ab>

He was patient to correct<lb facs="P45_TL00022"/>our English accent carefully; and he went minutely over our compositions,<lb facs="P45_TL00023"/>and it was our greatest joy that he wrote even a criticism on them. One<lb facs="P45_TL00024"/>of his earliest writings in my possession is a sort of criticism he wrote<lb facs="P45_TL00025"/>for my composition called " The Book, " in which I said that there must<lb facs="P45_TL00026"/>be a book-maker to produce a book, and also, God to create the world.<lb facs="P45_TL00027"/>I further said that as the civilized Europeans are Christians, the country<lb facs="P45_TL00028"/>of non-believers of the Christian faith cannot be called civilized.

The writers of the book<lb facs="P86_TL00007"/>were accused of " faking " the national art. The word " fake " is an<lb facs="P86_TL00008"/>inelegant term, and the nature of the deed was set out bj Mr Urban as<lb facs="P86_TL00009"/>a propaganda of " sociologists " and wealthy patrons, resulting in Lthe<lb facs="P86_TL00010"/>more or less dutiful dancing of the Morris, the Country Dance, and the<lb facs="P86_TL00011"/>Sword Dance before a crowd of admiring mediocrities who, presumably<lb facs="P86_TL00012"/>would exclaim: " The dear creatures! Are they not quaint ? Won't<lb facs="P86_TL00013"/>the vicar be delighted ? " &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P86_TL00014"/>&amp; Unhappily Mr Felix Urban had not spent much time in the parks<lb facs="P86_TL00015"/>and c!ub=rooms of Northern England, or, say, at Earsdon where the<lb facs="P86_TL00016"/>pitmen dance or at Flamborough where the .fishermen look upon this<lb facs="P86_TL00017"/>kind of work as Expression. &amp; ¬£&gt;<lb facs="P86_TL00018"/>&amp; Indeed Mr Urban not only denies that [we, the abettors of these<lb facs="P86_TL00019"/>practices, know anything about the Folk, but asserts that we do not<lb facs="P86_TL00020"/>know the secret of this energetic procedure. The secret, Mr Urban, is<lb facs="P86_TL00021"/>quite open, and I thought universally accepted. Rhythm, colour, sex,<lb facs="P86_TL00022"/>are the three words which I should say lie behind all Art that is not a<lb facs="P86_TL00023"/>...." fake ", shall we say r?<lb facs="P86_TL00024"/>In the case of the Northern Sword Dances... not Scottish variety...<lb facs="P86_TL00025"/>there comes the sacrificial element, and its absence, (today I admit,)<lb facs="P86_TL00026"/>tends to limit this particular form to "athletics". Perhaps with Mr Urban's<lb facs="P86_TL00027"/>help we can free the people a little more from the qualities of modern<lb facs="P86_TL00028"/>life which lie heavily upon our limbs. <lb facs="P86_TL00029"/>In that sense we are " sociologists ", though a sociologist proper is<lb facs="P86_TL00030"/>not a dancing animal. Let the dancers once more take their proper place,<lb facs="P86_TL00031"/>not only Dance but the larger Dance that is the Drama will grow. The<lb facs="P86_TL00032"/>modern soil is not contaminated by industrialism. Indeed I should say<lb facs="P86_TL00033"/>that bad art, rather than crude industrialism, is responsible for the<lb facs="P86_TL00034"/>absurd necessity of fighting about such matters. &amp;<lb facs="P86_TL00035"/>" Ireland is more fortunate," says Mr Urban.

And It may be through my own<lb facs="P87_TL00004"/>writing that he has so misunderstood Miss Neal's contribution to the<lb facs="P87_TL00005"/>volume. I have said several nasty things about modern civilised<lb facs="P87_TL00006"/>life.<lb facs="P87_TL00007"/>¬£? Like every other artist I am a sociologist to the extent of wishing to<lb facs="P87_TL00008"/>destroy a great deal which to the bone¬ªheaded man is precious.<lb facs="P87_TL00009"/>But I protest against the calm assumption that present day city life<lb facs="P87_TL00010"/>has killed the Soul of Man. It has not killed mine, and I see the Polk<lb facs="P87_TL00011"/>under strange disguises, and regard Civilisation as a pageant, which<lb facs="P87_TL00012"/>has been seen rather too many times. From Death comes Resurrection<lb facs="P87_TL00013"/>in Art as in all else. Despair may lurk in the wan coteries, but we need<lb facs="P87_TL00014"/>not tell the Morris Men that'rhythm and colour and sex are there, it<lb facs="P87_TL00015"/>would be their turn to keep the fiddler to the tune, and the artist away<lb facs="P87_TL00016"/>from sociology.<lb facs="P87_TL00017"/>¬£? Machinery has not killed rhythm, nor has smoke blotted out colour,<lb facs="P87_TL00018"/>nor is the human race extinct. So there is hope for Art. It is just from<lb facs="P87_TL00019"/>some such club as the Esperance Guild that the best pupils of the Craig<lb facs="P87_TL00020"/>School will come. For the general run of town children and young men<lb facs="P87_TL00021"/>do not easily mix with the more vital spirits of the age.<lb facs="P87_TL00022"/>Perhaps the most convincing thing that I can say Is that 1 agree<lb facs="P87_TL00023"/>with every word of Mr Urban's article as applied to some dreadful<lb facs="P87_TL00024"/>phantom of Art in the grips of Learning or some other enemy. But<lb facs="P87_TL00025"/>applied to the reality of creative and re-creative art in England it Is out<lb facs="P87_TL00026"/>of relation to fact. JZ? JZ? JZ? JZ? JZ? TZ?<lb facs="P87_TL00027"/>¬£? Had those remarks appeared in the daily press 1 should not have<lb facs="P87_TL00028"/>replied for, apart from the opinions of a few of the journals, their<lb facs="P87_TL00029"/>opposition is not a thing of great worth. But an article in The Mask<lb facs="P87_TL00030"/>carries a weight which cannot be ignored. I have been condemned as<lb facs="P87_TL00031"/>a 44 sociologist " conspiring with wealthy patrons to exploit the simple<lb facs="P87_TL00032"/>rustic. Whereas in truth I am a poet, digging in the field of journalism<lb facs="P87_TL00033"/>my colleagues being hardworkers and creators also. I enjoy the fight<lb facs="P87_TL00034"/>very much, and, as there is no law of libel against those who laugh at our<lb facs="P87_TL00035"/>not wholly pleasant word 44 Revival ", the reader may with your courtesy<lb facs="P87_TL00036"/>now judge between two opposed statements of the same facts.</ab>

It is the volume abstracted by Secretary<lb facs="P105_TL00007"/>Harlan from Whitman's desk in the Interior Department and made the basis for<lb facs="P105_TL00008"/>Whitman's discharge from that branch of the service. An account of this incident,<lb facs="P105_TL00009"/>written by Whitman himself, will be photographically reproduced and<lb facs="P105_TL00010"/>included. The edition will be limited to five hundred copies. The price fixed<lb facs="P105_TL00011"/>ten dollars for each copy. No books will be sent to editors for review and no<lb facs="P105_TL00012"/>rebates or discounts will be allowed to collectors or booksellers.<lb facs="P105_TL00013"/>The text matter of this book will be printed from the original plates, which still<lb facs="P105_TL00014"/>exist. The chirographical matter in Whitman's hand will be superimposed. In order to<lb facs="P105_TL00015"/>maintain a strict likeness to the original, in which Whitman used black ink and pen-<lb facs="P105_TL00016"/>cils of several colors, it will be necessary for each sheet to go through the press from<lb facs="P105_TL00017"/>three to five times. This is a costly process.<lb facs="P105_TL00018"/>The production of this work calls for the finest skill of the photographer, engraver<lb facs="P105_TL00019"/>and printer. But it will be faithfully supervised to the remotest particulars.<lb facs="P105_TL00020"/>Each volume will be authenticated by a number and my signature. Subscriptions<lb facs="P105_TL00021"/>will be filled in the order they are received.<lb facs="P105_TL00022"/>To persons who have a special Interest in Whitman, as well as to students and<lb facs="P105_TL00023"/>libraries (particularly to the libraries of schools and colleges), this remarkable reprint<lb facs="P105_TL00024"/>must have unusual significance.<lb facs="P105_TL00025"/>&amp;No steps will be practically taken in this matter until subscriptions sufficient to<lb facs="P105_TL00026"/>cover the Initial expenses are received Send for circular.

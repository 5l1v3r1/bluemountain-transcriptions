In old Spain,<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>in the ardent land of the Madonnas dressed in beautiful gowns similar<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>to lamp-shades of gold and pearls, the marionettes acted mysteries and<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>represented the drama of the Passion. They are clearly designated by an<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>article of the Synod of Orihuela, which forbids the use, for the sacred<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>representations, of these little moveable figures : "Imajunculis flctilibus,<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>mobili quadam agitatione compositis, quos titeres vulgari sermone ap<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

It is more surprising that criticism is as good as<lb facs="P21_TL00007"/>i t is.<lb facs="P21_TL00008"/>jSf Critics are a race of underrated men, and underpaid too. People seem<lb facs="P21_TL00009"/>to forget that criticism is an art and that the critic is an artist. We are<lb facs="P21_TL00010"/>greatly in need of him today. He could save many things, and for this<lb facs="P21_TL00011"/>reason it is to be wished that the English critic would study some of<lb facs="P21_TL00012"/>the works of Nietzsche, for he would find in him an exceptional friends<lb facs="P21_TL00013"/>There are some things which Frederick Nietzsche has said which, once<lb facs="P21_TL00014"/>perceived by the modern critic, would lend him additional strength, for<lb facs="P21_TL00015"/>Nietzsche often repeats old truths in so vital away that they seem to<lb facs="P21_TL00016"/>be new, and the newspaper will never refuse old truths. So Nietzsche is<lb facs="P21_TL00017"/>not only a good friend for the critic, but also a safe one. For instance<lb facs="P21_TL00018"/>in his 44 Wil! to Power", on page 297, second volume of the edition lately<lb facs="P21_TL00019"/>published by F. N. Foulis, he says something valuable for the critic. Here<lb facs="P21_TL00020"/>is the passage: ZZ? JZZ JZ? JS?<lb facs="P21_TL00021"/>"Concerning Flank: The terrible consequences of freedom are<lb facs="P21_TL00022"/>44 that everybody thinks he has the right to every problem. All order of<lb facs="P21_TL00023"/>44 rank has vanished." £? xz&gt; £? £?<lb facs="P21_TL00024"/>Upon this theme Nietzsche has many other things to say in other<lb facs="P21_TL00025"/>parts of his works, and it is one of the most important of the points<lb facs="P21_TL00026"/>which he makes. See how it may lend strength to the critic if he can<lb facs="P21_TL00027"/>only feel that he has it in his power to state that everybody has not the<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>right to every problem. For instance, the amount of loose chatter which<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>everyone thinks he is privileged to pour out concerning the theatre and<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>the art of the theatre does great harm and nullifies the efforts of the<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>few serious workers in this branch of art.

What, Archimedes a<lb facs="P33_TL00027"/>showman I It may seem incredible to many, but It is Monsignor Boldetti<lb facs="P33_TL00028"/>who says it, and it is not for me to contradict a priest.<lb facs="P33_TL00029"/>At Corneto, which, as everyone knows, is the ancient Tarquinii, six<lb facs="P33_TL00030"/>children's coffins were found in a vault; and in each of them there were<lb facs="P33_TL00031"/>numbers of small Roman marionettes, all of the most delicate workman*<lb facs="P33_TL00032"/>ship and decoration.

The greater<lb facs="P34_TL00004"/>part of the movable "figurine" to be found to-day in Museums and<lb facs="P34_TL00005"/>private collections, have come from the Christian catacombs of Rome,<lb facs="P34_TL00006"/>where it is not unusual to find engraved on the stone of a sepulchre,<lb facs="P34_TL00007"/>containing the bones of some child, long lamented by the new followers<lb facs="P34_TL00008"/>of Christ, groups of marionettes and ** pupazzi ", designed with the most<lb facs="P34_TL00009"/>graceful and touching ingenuity. Many puppets, and nearly all intact,<lb facs="P34_TL00010"/>were discovered during the year 1544 in the tomb of Maria, daugiiter of<lb facs="P34_TL00011"/>Stilicho, and wife of Honorius, who (Maria) had been buried in that<lb facs="P34_TL00012"/>sepulchre together with her infant child in the Cemetery of the Vatican.<lb facs="P34_TL00013"/>And here I must make a short digression:.,. The Emperor Honorius<lb facs="P34_TL00014"/>was the son of Theodosius the Great, who, for some time, united in his<lb facs="P34_TL00015"/>hands the supreme power of East and West, and maintained under his<lb facs="P34_TL00016"/>authority the entire Roman world. Born in 384 before Christ, Honorius<lb facs="P34_TL00017"/>was Consul at the age of two, a Caesar at four and Emperor at eleven.<lb facs="P34_TL00018"/>On the death of his father (in 395) and in the division of the Empire,<lb facs="P34_TL00019"/>the portion that fell to Honorius was the crown of the West, of which<lb facs="P34_TL00020"/>Rome was the brightest and most precious Jewel. But, already, the<lb facs="P34_TL00021"/>" barbari ", driven from their native mountains, and forced by necessity<lb facs="P34_TL00022"/>to possess fertile lands and the riches accumulated during so many years<lb facs="P34_TL00023"/>of conquest, began to scatter themselves all over Europe, carrying with<lb facs="P34_TL00024"/>them the scourge of invasion, war, fire and hunger. The Goths, led by<lb facs="P34_TL00025"/>Alarlc, descended into Italy from the one side, while the Suevi, under<lb facs="P34_TL00026"/>the command of Radagasius, overran the country from the other. <lb facs="P34_TL00027"/>Honorius was almost a child, weak, inexperienced, careless and timid.<lb facs="P34_TL00028"/>In the midst of numberless dangers, fearing enemies from without and<lb facs="P34_TL00029"/>traitors from within, he wandered from Rome to Milan, from Milan to<lb facs="P34_TL00030"/>Asti, from Asti to Ravenna, dragging his wife with him, and childishly<lb facs="P34_TL00031"/>amusing himself with the rearing of birds and poultry.

The reader<lb facs="P57_TL00006"/>will bear in mind, that this was not a motion in the dramatic sense of<lb facs="P57_TL00007"/>the word, but a puppet-//7re exhibition of a Mystery, with discrepancies<lb facs="P57_TL00008"/>of the same character as those which peculiarized the Mysteries of five<lb facs="P57_TL00009"/>centuries ago.

Maria. &amp;<lb facs="P60_TL00008"/>The best way to make a house for a marionette is to make it rather<lb facs="P60_TL00009"/>like a theatre. Take a kitchen table, of smooth white wood, and on it<lb facs="P60_TL00010"/>erect a simple frame work. Herd is a design to show you the shape of<lb facs="P60_TL00011"/>the frame work. Let the table be 8 ft long and 2 ft broad and as smodth<lb facs="P60_TL00012"/>and white as you like.<lb facs="P60_TL00013"/>&amp; You'll probably have to get a carpenter to make this table.<lb facs="P60_TL00014"/>&amp; Let your frame-work be made of pine-wood which is two inches square<lb facs="P60_TL00015"/>in thickness when planed and ready to use. Fix it firmly into position<lb facs="P60_TL00016"/>as indicated in figure A. And how to do this you know as well as I do.<lb facs="P60_TL00017"/>If you don't, consult a carpenter at 8d per hour. &amp;<lb facs="P60_TL00018"/>&amp; When this frame-work is in position add to it a proscenium of pine<lb facs="P60_TL00019"/>wood or three-ply over which you paste or glue a covering of tightly<lb facs="P60_TL00020"/>stretched holland of a good coarse grain. Let the holland be undyed.<lb facs="P60_TL00021"/>Fix this proscenium tightly to the front of your stage screwing it from<lb facs="P60_TL00022"/>the back.<lb facs="P60_TL00023"/>Around the proscenium arch you can add what is called a u return ".<lb facs="P60_TL00024"/>Let this "return" be three inches broad, (figure C). Again consult your<lb facs="P60_TL00025"/>carpenter. Behind this you suspend a pair of sliding curtains of the same<lb facs="P60_TL00026"/>colour as the proscenium. JZ?<lb facs="P60_TL00027"/>When you have done all that 1 tell you, suspend your marionettes<lb facs="P60_TL00028"/>somehow or other so that they rest .their feet on the stage.

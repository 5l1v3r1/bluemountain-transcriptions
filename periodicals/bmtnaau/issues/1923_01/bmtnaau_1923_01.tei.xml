Glance at the plays of the period and<lb facs="P30_TL00015"/>you will find trivial stage directions and scant instructions<lb facs="P30_TL00016"/>as to the costuming. To-day Shaw's stage directions to<lb facs="P30_TL00017"/>the actors occupy as much space in a play manuscript as<lb facs="P30_TL00018"/>does the acting play itself. And Barrie's are often as<lb facs="P30_TL00019"/>long as Shaw's.<lb facs="P30_TL00020"/>Walkley says that an actor must be impressed by the<lb facs="P30_TL00021"/>outward and visible signs of things rather than by the<lb facs="P30_TL00022"/>things themselves. It is true that an actor is so impressed,<lb facs="P30_TL00023"/>but this does not, assuredly, argue that he should be. What<lb facs="P30_TL00024"/>Walkley should have said was that a theatre audience is<lb facs="P30_TL00025"/>impressed by the outward and visble signs of things rather<lb facs="P30_TL00026"/>than by the things themselves and that, this being the case,<lb facs="P30_TL00027"/>the actor—being by nature of his craft a lazy fellow—<lb facs="P30_TL00028"/>takes the same easy course so to impress his audience.<lb facs="P30_TL00029"/>To contend that this is, therefore, just what the actor<lb facs="P30_TL00030"/>ought to do—and that is but fair to allow him to do it<lb facs="P30_TL00031"/>—is to contend that the best actor is that actor who in<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P30_TL00032"/>terprets not the role written for him by the dramatist but<lb facs="P30_TL00033"/>the audience's composite idea of the role written for him<lb facs="P30_TL00034"/>by the dramatist. And to make this contention is to speak<lb facs="P30_TL00035"/>in terms of mob popularity, which popularity is, of course,<lb facs="P30_TL00036"/>ever vitally at odds with art of any kind—even what<lb facs="P30_TL00037"/>Moore called the lowest of all the arts, acting. The plain<lb facs="P30_TL00038"/>truth, patently enough, is that the actor bears the same<lb facs="P30_TL00039"/>relation to an artist that the phonograph bears to Madame<lb facs="P30_TL00040"/>Sembrich. The artist is contemptuous of the crowd. The<lb facs="P30_TL00041"/>only actor in America who is contemptuous of the crowd<lb facs="P30_TL00042"/>is Mr. Arnold Daly. And Daly, by that mark, is the<lb facs="P30_TL00043"/>only ac or in America who approaches the rank of an<lb facs="P30_TL00044"/>artist. And Daly, as actors are regarded by the theatre<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Parigi (a comedian of that<lb facs="P60_TL00034"/>time) side by side with them would seem an angel, and<lb facs="P60_TL00035"/>be assured, I do not exaggerate.<lb facs="P60_TL00036"/>At the Argentina n Eufemio di Messina 11, was given,<lb facs="P60_TL00037"/>the libretto by J.

Of this Leopardi<lb facs="P60_TL00039"/>wrote to his brother: n Carafa's opera is nearly all stolen<lb facs="P60_TL00040"/>from Rossini, but so badly that neither the imitation nor<lb facs="P60_TL00041"/>what was original gave the least pleasure.... All the voices<lb facs="P60_TL00042"/>were mediocre except the tenor David and the contralto<lb facs="P60_TL00043"/>Santina Ferlotti ....but even the most beautiful voice applied<lb facs="P60_TL00044"/>to a melody which signifies nothing cannot produce any<lb facs="P60_TL00045"/>grand effect.

                                       <lb facs="P61_TL00016"/>1923. January 26th. There are seldom any dramatic<lb facs="P61_TL00017"/>performances here, and so perhaps it is this fact which<lb facs="P61_TL00018"/>renders the performances in the Teatrino of the Palazzo<lb facs="P61_TL00019"/>Lazzone so remarkable in our eyes.<lb facs="P61_TL00020"/>Reality on the stage is rare, but in RLa Donna n, a<lb facs="P61_TL00021"/>piece by Marco Pallanc, the actors brought us reality such<lb facs="P61_TL00022"/>as I have not seen before in London, Prague or Moscow.<lb facs="P61_TL00023"/>The scene was modern; modern realism often offends one,<lb facs="P61_TL00024"/>but this scene, (there was only one), was reality itself.<lb facs="P61_TL00025"/>I felt the air which floated in through the large French<lb facs="P61_TL00026"/>windows leading on to the lawn, .... a lawn which I swear<lb facs="P61_TL00027"/>I took to be real. \ have never, as I said, seen such<lb facs="P61_TL00028"/>realism. The two principal actors, Signor Monza and<lb facs="P61_TL00029"/>Signorina Lampretto, were acting, I suppose. 1 tried to<lb facs="P61_TL00030"/>tell myself this when I saw the latter dying in the third<lb facs="P61_TL00031"/>and last act of this tragic little piece. But even now I<lb facs="P61_TL00032"/>cannot assure myself that it was acting.<lb facs="P61_TL00033"/>Signor Monza had a small part he could not have<lb facs="P61_TL00034"/>been more than half an hour on the stage yet I know<lb facs="P61_TL00035"/>him as 1 know myself. I learnt his whole story, character,<lb facs="P61_TL00036"/>regrets and achievement. The play turns on these.<lb facs="P61_TL00037"/>A most ingenious method of illuminating the stage is<lb facs="P61_TL00038"/>used in Budrio, at least in the Palazzo Lazzone. There<lb facs="P61_TL00039"/>are seven discs of polished marble hung round the back of<lb facs="P61_TL00040"/>the scene, each measuring about five feet in circumference,<lb facs="P61_TL00041"/>and in the centre of these and somehow concealed in them<lb facs="P61_TL00042"/>1 thought, (for 1 only had time to glance at them), were<lb facs="P61_TL00043"/>three to four electric globes. I supposed the candle power<lb facs="P61_TL00044"/>to be about 3000 per disc. By some contrivance these<lb facs="P61_TL00045"/>discs or lamps are moved very easily to any defined spot<lb facs="P61_TL00046"/>and very swiftly, this in spite of the fact that they<lb facs="P61_TL00047"/>must weigh a great deal.<lb facs="P61_TL00048"/>I asked the manager why marble was employed instead<lb facs="P61_TL00049"/>of light metal reflectors.

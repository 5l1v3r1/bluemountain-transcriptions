                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>I n this number are reprinted from the original wood blocks three of the designs which<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>appeared in a very scarce programme issued by the Purcell Operatic Society in 1900 when Mr<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>Gordon Craig produced his first opera with his friend Mr Martin Shaw the English composer.<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>&amp; The programme was in itself a beautiful work of art of about fifteen to twenty pages,<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>containing eight or nine wood engravings of the scene and figures in the opera. &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>The performance was given at the Conservatoire in Hampstead under most disadvantageous<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>conditions. For such is the up-to-date patriotism of England that, when British artists wish<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>to do honour to their art, they are obliged to do it with all the odds against them. &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>&amp; Had Mr Craig, and Mr Shaw been born in Berlin, Vienna, St Petersburg, Moscow,<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>Munich or any of the great continental cities of the leading powers of Europe, they would<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>without doubt have received enthusiastic support which would not have been withdrawn<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>from them after the first performance but would have continued to assist them for as many<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>years as the artists showed talent and pluck.<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>&amp; From the year 1900, the date of this programme of which 1 write until the present<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>year, Mr Craig has advanced through, and in spite of, opposition. How much easier it would<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>have been, and how much more profitable for the people of England to have attempted to<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>understand what he meant; and if they could not understand, to have waited patiently<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>until they could understand. But now to a large public these things are becoming quite<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>clear and therefore these designs from the programme of his first production are reprinted<lb facs="P5_TL00039"/>so that they may not be entirely lost, for I understand that only a few hundred copies of<lb facs="P5_TL00040"/>this programme were printed.<lb facs="P5_TL00041"/>Purcell's Opera is capable of being presented on the stage in very many different ways.<lb facs="P5_TL00042"/>It can be given with the singers seated on chairs and making but few movements; or it<lb facs="P5_TL00043"/>can be mounted as they mount the operas of Gluck in Paris. And then there is another,<lb facs="P5_TL00044"/>style of mounting it; that is in the more modern up-to-date manner. And then there is the<lb facs="P5_TL00045"/>way of the individualist.

In this scene Mr Craig<lb facs="P6_TL00006"/>chose to give the idea of Wreckage, We seemed to be on some long low waste of dunes to<lb facs="P6_TL00007"/>which had drifted all the wreckage of the world.... the skeletons of ships and men. Above<lb facs="P6_TL00008"/>all this rose the figure of the Sorceress herself, grown thick with wreckage, looking like<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>some ancient figure-head to which all the flotsam and jetsome and seaweed of the ocean<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>was clinging. Her one arm and hand is a dead thing of wood; the other is reaching down<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>into the earth finding there roots in the unfruitful soil. Only one movement was designed<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>for this figure; it was when, in her rage, she wrenched this rooted hand and arm free from<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>the earth, snapping and tearing the roots and scattering the rotten debris like a cloud<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>of delusion into the world.<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>The other design for the helmetted figure of /Eneas explains itself. The third,<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>the little heading, is of an eighteenth century orchestra, playing in the open air before a<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>scene which breathes out the romance of mediaeval Germany. &amp; &amp; &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>The Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel dined with me, and I asked them how they dared so<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>roundly to assert that God spoke to them, and whether they did not think at the time that<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>they would be misunderstood, and so be the cause of imposition. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>Isaiah answered: 44 I saw no God, nor heard any, in a finite organical perception: but<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>44 my senses discovered the infinite in everything; and as I was then persuaded, and remained<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>44 confirmed, that the voice of honest indignation is the voice of God, I cared not for<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>46 consequences, but wrote.<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>Then I asked: 44 Does a firm persuasion that a thing is so, make it so? " £?<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>&amp; He replied: 44 All poets believe that it does, and in ages of imagination this firm persuasion<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>44 removed mountains; but many are not capable of a firm persuasion of anything. " J&amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>&amp; Then Esekiel said: 44 The philosophy of the East taught the first principles of human<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>44 perception; some nations held one principle for the origin, and some another. We of Israel<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>44 taught that the Poetic Genius (as you now call it) was the first principle, and all the<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>44 others merely derivative, which was the cause of our despising the Priests and Philosophers<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>44 of other countries, and prophesying that all Gods would at last be proved to originate in<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>44 ours, and to be the tributaries of the Poetic Genius. It was this that our great poet King<lb facs="P12_TL00043"/>44 David desired so fervently, and invokes so pathetically, saying by this he conquers enemies<lb facs="P12_TL00044"/>44 and governs kingdoms; and we so loved our God that we cursed in His name all the deities<lb facs="P12_TL00045"/>44 of surrounding nations, and asserted that they had rebelled. From these opinions the<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>44 vulgar came to think that all nations would at last be subject to the Jews. " <lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>&amp; " This, " said he, 44 like all firm persuasions, is come to pass, for all nations believe the<lb facs="P12_TL00048"/>44 Jews' code, and worship the Jews' God; and what greater subjection can be? "<lb facs="P12_TL00049"/>I heard this with some wonder, and must confess my own conviction. After dinner I<lb facs="P12_TL00050"/>asked Isaiah to favour the world with his lost works; he said none of equal value was lost.<lb facs="P12_TL00051"/>Ezekiel said the same of his.<lb facs="P12_TL00052"/>&amp; I also asked Isaiah what made him go naked and barefoot three years. He answered:<lb facs="P12_TL00053"/>44 The same that made our friend Diogenes the Grecian. " &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00054"/>&amp; I then asked Ezekiel why he ate dung, and lay so long on his right and left side. He<lb facs="P12_TL00055"/>answered: 44 The desire of raising other meh into a perception of the infinite. This the<lb facs="P12_TL00056"/>44 North American tribes practise. And is he honest who resists his genius or conscience,<lb facs="P12_TL00057"/>44 only for the sake of present ease or gratification? " &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P13_TL00008"/>comedy in this country is clearly named on the lucus a non lucendo principle.<lb facs="P13_TL00009"/>It seems to have been invented by Mr George Edwardes and brought to its present<lb facs="P13_TL00010"/>pitch of efficiency, or degeneracy, (whichever way you like to take it) by Mr Seymour<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>Hicks. Perhaps, however, " evolved " would be a better term than " invented Still, whoever<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>the primarily responsible party may be he has nothing of which to boast, for I would defy<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>even Sherlock Holmes himself to discover anything more utterly banal, pointless, devoid<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>of humour, boring, silly, un=melodious, and generally calculated to make one tired than<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>the average musical comedy as presented at the different theatres given over to this form<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>of alleged entertainment every week day night, and Wednesday and Saturday afternoons<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>throughout the year.<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>&amp; On this subject I speak from considerable experience, for 1 have patiently sat out musical<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>comedy, over and over again, and under all circumstances, occupying a place in the gallery,<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>pit, stalls, boxes, and on the stage itself; I have stood the comedian drinks, taken the<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>leading lady out to tea after a matinee, and shaken hands with the composer; I have heard<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>the music before, during, and after the performance; and in half a dozen cases I have also<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>read the " book of the words " backwards, forwards, and sideways, so as to gather some<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>rudimentary idea of the author's intentions. Yet, even after this exhaustive training, I am<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>as far from appreciating such entertainments as ever. The loss, no doubt, is mine. &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>&amp; Musical comedies would all appear to be built to much the same pattern, whether they<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>be produced at the Gaiety, or anywhere else. The person who has seen one has seen the<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>lot. Among the features common to this description of theatrical fare is the fact that it<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>usually takes from four to eight people to write the words and compose the music, and that<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>each of these people takes leave of his senses before he starts work. On the whole, I am<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>inclined to regard this plethora of librettists and composers as a desirable provision. At any<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>rate, in the few instances when we have had only two persons responsible between them<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>for the words and music we do not seem to get beyond the childish humours of " Amasis "<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>and pieces of a similar genre. Personally, I should like to find Mr Edwardes and Mr Frohman<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>enlisting a corps of fifty experts next time they produce a " play with music as it is the<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>fashion to call these entertainments nowadays. There is just a bare possibility then that<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>one of the fifty might have occasional moments of intelligence.<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>Every musical comedy is closely related to all those that have gone before, and probably<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>to all those that will come after it as well. I do not care two straws whether the theatre<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>in question be the Gaiety, the Aldwych, the Apollo, or Daly's and located in the Strand, in<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>Shaftesbury Avenue, in Leicester Square, in Bayswater, or in Jericho — one specimen piece<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>is practically the same as another, so far as goes what is humourously called the " plot<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>&amp; This never varies in respect of its main outlines. To begin with, we have the dashing<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>hero, who, in return for his labours, draws a salary of fifty pounds a week and has his<lb facs="P13_TL00045"/>name on the motor busses. He is poor but honest in the first act, and is united, with the<lb facs="P13_TL00046"/>full consent of her parents, to the lady of his choice just before the final curtain falls. He<lb facs="P13_TL00047"/>is further distinguished by a light baritone voice, a heart in the right place, and a fondness<lb facs="P13_TL00048"/>for disporting himself on ail occasions in full naval or military uniform. Sometimes his kit<lb facs="P13_TL00049"/>suggests a pleasing attempt to combine the principal sartorial features of both Services.<lb facs="P13_TL00050"/>The heroine, with whom he has most of his scenes, is remarkable for little beyond a wealth<lb facs="P13_TL00051"/>of peroxide of hydrogen-dyed hair, a pronounced simper, and some elementary notions of<lb facs="P13_TL00052"/>singing and dancing. I have more respect for the comedian. This member of the cast is, it<lb facs="P13_TL00053"/>is true, generally undersized and ugly, and with about as much spontaneous humour in<lb facs="P13_TL00054"/>his composition as one could expect of a man who habitually looks as though he had tossed<lb facs="P13_TL00055"/>for his dinner and lost, and who has to spend his evenings making jokes that are nearly<lb facs="P13_TL00056"/>as broad as they are long. Still, he always works harder than anybody else connected with<lb facs="P13_TL00057"/>the piece, and it is almost entirely due to his efforts that managers, authors, and composers<lb facs="P13_TL00058"/>are able to buy motor-cars and spend the winter on the Riviera. The comedian is the " draw "<lb facs="P13_TL00059"/>the magnet.of the musical comedy world, and brings more money into the box-office than<lb facs="P13_TL00060"/>the rest of the company put together. Accordingly, he receives the emoluments of an</ab>

These last, technically termed a " crowd caper aimlessly<lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>about the stage in the wake of the principals, with one eye permanently fixed on the<lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>limelight man, and the other on the occupants of the front row of the stalls. At the proper<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>moment, and quite mechanically, they form a picturesque group in the centre and sing at<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>the tops of their voices the inane words allotted them by the person who has written the<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>44 lyrics ". To remove a general (and deeply rooted) misconception, 1 may say, as an expert,<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>that a musical comedy 44 crowd " is always composed of entirely respectable and well-behaved<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>young men and women. The only thing I have against them is that their intelligence is<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>almost invariably atrophied. Yet, one can scarcely blame them for this, when the nature<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>of their employment is taken into consideration. The words of the songs (now, by the way,<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>known as 44 lyrics ") which these unfortunate people are compelled to sing, in order to gain<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>an honest livelihood, usually appear to have emanated from the disordered mind of a<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>wandering lunatic. I am told that in a piece of this class, called 44 The Belle of New York ",<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>the opening lines allotted to the unhappy chorus ran:<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>44 When a man is twenty-one<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>Then is the time to drink hot rum! "<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>This bright, particular gem of its class was produced ten years ago, and is still running<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>in the provinces, We do not, however, appear to have advanced far since those days. As I<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>write, 1 have before me a printed copy of the 44 lyrics " of a recent Gaiety success. Here is<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>a verse that the chorus had to deliver as the curtain rose:<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>44 If we love in the land we live<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>We must live in thte land we love,<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>Though the iron pierce the soul,<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>Wear the velvet glove;<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>But the future must take its course,<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>Be it bankruptcy or divorce;<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>That is why we're here to see<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>Monsieur Babori — ah! "<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>Between this and the old fashioned 44 sing tra, la, la, la, la! Sing tol, de rol, de, do! "<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>that we all sneer at as being out of date, I really cannot see a hap'orth of difference. &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>jgr If those who have read the fragment just quoted without suffering serious injury can<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>endure a second specimen from a similar source I append one herewith:<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>44 If ever we meet the German Fleet<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>And it as strong as ours is,<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>I give you my word, Lord Charles Beresford<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>Will give it a slap on the trousers! "<lb facs="P14_TL00051"/>The brain that evolved this would be capable of anything. &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00052"/>Like most other people connected with the production of musical comedies nowadays,<lb facs="P14_TL00053"/>the people who write the necessary songs always take themselves very seriously. They<lb facs="P14_TL00054"/>accord interviews to reporters from Carmelite Street and discourse portentously on their<lb facs="P14_TL00055"/>44 art ". The only person among the lot of them who appears to have any sober views about<lb facs="P14_TL00056"/>the matter is, it seems to me, Mr James Glover, the musical conductor of Drury Lane. I<lb facs="P14_TL00057"/>once read an article by this authority on the closely allied subject of pantomime songs. In<lb facs="P14_TL00058"/>the course of this Mr Glover backed himself to write a typical ballad off hand which should<lb facs="P14_TL00059"/>be at least no worse than the average one of its kind. A representative verse from this<lb facs="P14_TL00060"/>effort ran as follows:<lb facs="P14_TL00061"/>44 Mary Jane of Tooting<lb facs="P14_TL00062"/>Was a proper sort of girl<lb facs="P14_TL00063"/>When her sweetheart from his office got the push;<lb facs="P14_TL00064"/>But Mary knew a thing or two<lb facs="P14_TL00065"/>And bolted with an Earl;<lb facs="P14_TL00066"/>So they're living now in naughty Shepherd's Bush!

                                    <lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>For the life of me I cannot see that this is in any respect more vulgar or silly, or<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>meaningless than the average " lyric " figuring in musical comedy. Of course, there are<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>people who can write songs with some regard for the principles of scansion, rhythm and<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>sense — the names of Mr Adrian Ross, and Captain Basil Hood suggest themselves more<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>particularly-— but the number of them seems to be a very small one. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>There are people who would like to see musical comedy prohibited, and severe penalties<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>meted out to all who either write, witness, produce, or act in anything of the sort. Despite<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>my own inability to appreciate such entertainments, 1 am, however, by no means opposed<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>to them. 1 consider, indeed, that they fulfil a very good purpose, and ought on this account<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>to be encouraged.<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>To begin with, every musical comedy — no matter how bad, at least provides exceedingly<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>well paid employment for a large number of amiable young women, with pretty faces and<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>shapely limbs, who have not sufficient brains among the lot of them to earn ten shillings<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>a week as nursery governesses.<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>Again, where else, but from the subordinate ranks of a musical comedy cast list, would<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>our bachelor guardsmen and heirs to the peerage find suitable partners in life? 1 know<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>that in certain exclusive—and ultra old fashioned—circles the narrow view obtains that a<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>peer should no more marry an actress than an actor should marry a peeress. 1am convinced<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>though that this is entirely wrong. In fact, 1 feel so strongly on the subject that not only<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>would I say an uncompromising yes to the important domestic problem, " Should Peers marry<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>Chorus Girls? " (which recently came up for discussion in the Perfect lady, or some similar<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>organ), but I would even go so far as to say that they ought to be compelled to do so by<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>law. This is because the number of unappropriated chorus-girls is, and must be, always<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>vastly in excess of the number of eligible peers. Under the circumstances then, it is nothing<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>less than the bounden duty of every peer, not already provided for, to lead to the altar at<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>least one member of the chorus. 1 am glad to find that this view is generally inclined to<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>by at any rate the eldest sons of most of our leading peers. A few, however, are obstinately<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>standing out, but this, perhaps, is only to be expected in a country where so many time-worn<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>class distinctions still obtain. Besides, there are peers whom no self-respecting chorus girl<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>would marry while an unattached scene shifter was left. <lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>Musical comedy no use, indeed 1 Pray, what shall we be hearing next-? &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00007"/>pericles—so popular in the seventeenth century that it<lb facs="P16_TL00008"/>divided the honours with Jane Shore—is such a very<lb facs="P16_TL00009"/>doubtful play, no matter what point of view we take, that I<lb facs="P16_TL00010"/>might fairly be excused if I omitted it altogether from this<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>series. It is, moreover, a drama that has not been acted for<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>a long time, and it is devoutly to foe hoped never may be<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>acted again. Gower as chorus fixes the date of the story,<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>and shows that the " Antiochus, King of Antioch, " of the<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>dramatis petsonsc, is the same as Antiochus the Great who<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>reigned over Syria B. C. 233—187. There is nothing, probably,<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>in the whole range of dramatic writing where the unities of<lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>time and place are so persistently disregarded as in Pericles.<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>In the four scenes of the short first Act we are hurried<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>from Antioch to Tyre, and from Tyre to Tharsus. By the<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>time we reach the second Act we find ourselves in<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>" Pentapolis " (Cyrenaica) (1), whence we go to Tyre and<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>back again. In the third Act we are on a ship at sea, then<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>at Ephesus, then at Tharsus, returning again to Ephesus.<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>In the next act we go to and fro between Tharsus and<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>Mitylene, and in the last we go from Mitylene to Ephesus.<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>Then again the text teems with anachronisms, e. g., stringed<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>viols, pistols, bellows, parish churches with their steeples,<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>bells and all, beadles, tennis courts, tournaments, shields<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>charged with mediaeval devices and mottoes, ink and paper,<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>a Spaniard in a ruff, a French knight—one " Monsieur</ab>

The scene of this Comedy is Ephesus, and<lb facs="P16_TL00039"/>the time that when the old order of things was giving place to the new. Therefore,<lb facs="P16_TL00040"/>although 1 have classed this work with the Greek plays, it is really classical only in the<lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>associations of its scenery and in the pictures it may present us of such portions of the<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>ancient city which may have been preserved as late as the time of Constantine. For we<lb facs="P16_TL00043"/>must, i think, admit that the Comedy of Errors has reference to a time when the Christian<lb facs="P16_TL00044"/>Church of Ephesus was enjoying either the undisturbed days that followed after the<lb facs="P16_TL00045"/>Diocletian persecution (A. D. 303), or the earlier lull that ensued about fifty years before<lb facs="P16_TL00046"/>this, or immediately after the Valerian persecution. As there is not the faintest indication<lb facs="P16_TL00047"/>In the text of the worship of either the Greek or Ephesian Artemis, as no one throughout<lb facs="P16_TL00048"/>the play refers to any god or goddess of Roman, Greek, or Asiatic mythology, and as there<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>is an abbess evidently regarded with no small respect, I am inclined to accept the latest<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>date or the reign of Constantine the Great, A. D. 306-337, as the period of the action, a<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>time when Ephesus, although her glory had departed, was still a busy place, when her<lb facs="P16_TL00052"/>temples and public buildings had not yet been scanned from the quarryman's point of view,<lb facs="P16_TL00053"/>and when a stranger might very well desire or even be anxious to " view the city, " and<lb facs="P16_TL00054"/>" gaze upon the buildings</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>&amp; The scenery as set down for this comedy consists of: —<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>1. A hall in the Duke's palace.<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>2. A public place (for Acts 2 and 4).<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>3. A public place (in front of the house of Antipholus for Act. 3).<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>4. A public place (in front of a nunnery for Act 5).<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>&amp; The second Scene of the first Act is also a public place or street; and if an open<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>vestibule or portico of the palace be arranged so as to form part of it, one set scene might<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>well serve for the first Act. The scenery thus treated would be wholly external, and<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>illustrative of the street architecture of Ephesus circa A. D. 330. With a little care these<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>four scenes might be made very interesting, for nowhere did the twilight of the old order<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>of things and the dawn of the new commingle more completely than in this great Ionian<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>city. But the old order of things was very different in the Ionian Greek colony of Asia<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>Minor to what it was in Hellas proper. The basic influence of the native or Asiatic in this<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>colony was immense, whilst the operations, first of their neighbour Crceseus, then of Persia<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>on the one hand, and Macedonia on the other, were not likely to pass over the heads of<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>such a lively impressionable mixed population as the Ephesians were without leaving some<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>evidence behind them. The Asiatic part in the combination was markedly visible in the<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>great idol. The Artemis of the Greeks closely fellowed in the Diana of the Romans was<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>ever a maiden goddess, and in early mythology was as distinct from the Goddess of the Moon<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>as Apollo was from Helios. The chaste goddess of the silver bow sending forth arrows armed<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>0<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>with plagues and death for man and beast, yet helpful and curative, and especially watchful<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>of the young, is a very different sort of divinity from one whose priests were eunuchs,<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>and who embodied as her chief attractions the ideas of fructification and nourishment:<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>one who was represented not as a tall small-hipped, beautiful woman by any manner of<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>means, but as a strange archaic mass of symbolism, of which it is enough to say that a<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>mural crown rested upon the head, and the body was literally covered with numerous<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>breasts (1). Later on, or B. C., 355, when the Great Temple (whose character, has been made<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>known to us through Mr. J. T. Wood's excavations) was designed, the influence of<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>Persepolitan art becomes manifest. The colunince ccelatce are almost as widely separated<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>from the pillars of the Athenian Propylae or the Parthenon as the freest-Renaissance is<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>from the severest Roman. Commercial prosperity and undisciplined freedom were tolerably<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>safe foundations for the licentiousness and voluptuous luxury that towered not only over<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>Ephesian society, but over the whole Ionian district, and this licentiousness, splendid in its<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>extravagance, we may be quite sure found expression in architecture and sculpture as well<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>as in poetry and music, or in habits of life. The fragments of the Temple now in the British<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>Museum, especially of the colunince ccelatce, or sculptured pillars, are quite sufficient to show<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>this, and although from its size and its costliness, both in material and labour, this building<lb facs="P17_TL00048"/>might have arrested the attention of the mass of the people, and have been regarded as one<lb facs="P17_TL00049"/>of the wonders of the world by men who revelled in the luck of their geographical position,<lb facs="P17_TL00050"/>who loved uproar and witchcraft, but could not fight—although no doubt there were certain<lb facs="P17_TL00051"/>elegances in its Ionic proportions, enchanting effects in its tall columns and their long vistas<lb facs="P17_TL00052"/>and bewitching beauty in its architectural features made to look their best by help of paint<lb facs="P17_TL00053"/>and the plastic art; yet from the evidence before us the Doric temple of Minerva at Athens,<lb facs="P17_TL00054"/>covering not a quarter of the area this at Ephesus occupied, must have been as immeasurably<lb facs="P17_TL00055"/>superior to it as order is to confusion or sobriety to intemperance. The general street<lb facs="P17_TL00056"/>architecture of Ephesus, A. D. 330, would not, however, be composed of Ionic colonnades, nor<lb facs="P17_TL00057"/>would the house of Antipholus, nor even that of the chief magistrate, duke, or proconsul<lb facs="P17_TL00058"/>be a miniature reproduction of the temple of Artemis or Diana. That the houses of Ephesus<lb facs="P17_TL00059"/>were more elaborate and more fanciful than those of towns where the Doric style prevailed<lb facs="P17_TL00060"/>may be at once admitted; that in the better class of buildings the upper floor might have<lb facs="P17_TL00061"/>been planned as an open loggia surrounded by Ionic columns supporting entablature and<lb facs="P17_TL00062"/>low-pitched roof is not improbable; that public leschai with rows of marble shafts and<lb facs="P17_TL00063"/>picture-covered walls might be seen in many an open place is more than probable, and it<lb facs="P17_TL00064"/>is not unlikely that some of these might have existed in the midst of new Roman arches and<lb facs="P17_TL00065"/>piles of Roman pilasters in A. D. 330 but the scene painter, whose only notion of Ephesus</ab>

If, however, he is<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>minded to make his v/ork go hand in hand with our age—an age when every branch of<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>science is being more or less explored—then by careful study of Mr Wood's discoveries and<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>of such remains and restorations of the monuments of Xanthus and Halicarnassus that<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>we possess the character of the early architecture of Ephesus may be secured. So, also,<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>by turning his attention to such works as the houses at Pompeii, the Flavian Amphiteatre<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>(A. D. 70), Diocletian's Palace at Spalatro (A. D. 284), and even the Porta Nigra at Treves,<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>he may be enabled, if he has any constructive intelligence, to give us a tolerably fair idea<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>of the later buildings of Ephesus in A. D. 330. &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>&amp; For the costume of the Comedy of Errors authorities are to be found in wall paintings,<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>in coins, and in the sculptures of the reign of Constantine. The influence of Rome, it must<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>be remembered, was like no other influence the world has ever experienced in the irresistible<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>power with which she grasped the outward life of the people she conquered, moulding their<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>dress and their building, in her own way. In Gaul, in Germany, in Asia, as in Italy, the<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>same Roman fashions prevailed. The ordinary civil dress was a long tunic, made without<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>sleeves, but cut square, so that the material fell over the shoulder like loose sleeves, much<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>the same as we see in the Greek chiton, for the sleeved tunic does not appear to have been<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>generally adopted until the fifth century. The men's tunic was as a rule short, the women's<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>long. Three kinds of mantle or upper garment were used at this time:—1, a short thick<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>woollen cloak, called pcenula, reaching to the knee, chiefly used on journeys as less<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>cumbersome than the other forms of wrap; 2, a birrus or cloak for rainy weather, generally<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>made of wool left long and shaggy—this was also used as a hood or covering for the head;<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>3, the toga, used only by the upper classes at important meetings or on great festive occasions;<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>this robe was made extremely capacious, so as to be full of folds when arranged on the<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>body, and was cut in a curved shape, usually something less than a semicircle: one end was<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>thrown over the left shoulder, and the circular part hung down in front, neariy as low as<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>the feet. It was then wrapped round the back, passed under the right arm, and brought<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>once more over the left shoulder across the chest like a belt, but not too tightly. The<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>" Duke" in the play should wear a toga embroidered with gold, but the ordinary toga<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>was of plain white wool. In A. D. 330 the use of the toga was rapidly on the decline. As<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>an article of female costume it had long been given up, except by the meretrix and the<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>adultera, the latter of whom at the time we are considering had not much opportunity for<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>the display of the toga or any other costume, for by the law of Constantine she was first<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>whipped and then sent to a nunnery, whence if not taken by her husband she was forced<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>to take the habit of a nun and the convent gate was closed on her for ever. The meretrix<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>in the comedy might, besides her tunic, wear a thin silk scarf or shawl, for silk or sericum<lb facs="P18_TL00046"/>as an ordinary material for the better kind of dress had come into fashion, gone out and<lb facs="P18_TL00047"/>come in again since the time of Hermione and Timon of Athens. Holoserica or bonbycinum<lb facs="P18_TL00048"/>was made entirely from the cocoons of the homhyx or silkworm, but there was also a<lb facs="P18_TL00049"/>semi=silk manufacture known by the name subsericus, where the wrap was of linen or<lb facs="P18_TL00050"/>wool, and this was by no means an uncommon material in the wardrobes of the luxurious<lb facs="P18_TL00051"/>and the gay of both sexes, although its use was regarded with more or less jealousy by<lb facs="P18_TL00052"/>imperial eyes. The "Abbess" would be dressed in the tunic and the birrus; the latter<lb facs="P18_TL00053"/>worn over the head—hood*wise—brought round the right cheek over the breast, and thrown<lb facs="P18_TL00054"/>over the left shoulder. Any figure on the dress, or on the " Priory," would be probably<lb facs="P18_TL00055"/>limited to that of the sacred monogram (the X and P) which appears on the coins of<lb facs="P18_TL00056"/>Constantine, and which seems to have been then generally used, precisely as the<lb facs="P18_TL00057"/>simple form of cross was at a later period. A material much affected by the Christians<lb facs="P18_TL00058"/>of this period was a woollen stuff with a dark band woven in it, or left as the selvage. In<lb facs="P18_TL00059"/>the latter case the dress, if made of four widths of stuff, would thus have two vertical stripes<lb facs="P18_TL00060"/>on the front and the back, where the selvages joined. The psenula shown on one of<lb facs="P18_TL00061"/>the paintings in the Catacombs, illustrated by Perret, shows the outer or edge border dark,<lb facs="P18_TL00062"/>and two bands double the width of this border, dividing the mantle into what, if laid out,<lb facs="P18_TL00063"/>would be three equal portions. Shoes and slippers appear to have been commonly worn by<lb facs="P18_TL00064"/>both sexes, and necklaces, chains, ear-rings, costly girdles, and head dresses, seem to have</ab>

Some first signs of simmering were<lb facs="P19_TL00012"/>observed a while ago, and now the thing promises to boil. If the scheme develops to<lb facs="P19_TL00013"/>larger proportions an eruption may be expected and extermination faithfully guaranteed.<lb facs="P19_TL00014"/>&amp; Extermination of what? Why, of everything that Shakespeare stands for.<lb facs="P19_TL00015"/>&amp; The details of the scheme are to be made public this month, when the general meeting<lb facs="P19_TL00016"/>of the committee will take place.<lb facs="P19_TL00017"/>" Round about the cauldron go,<lb facs="P19_TL00018"/>In the poison'd entrails throw. "<lb facs="P19_TL00019"/>&amp; It is generally whispered that a well-known actor-manager will be made the scapegoat<lb facs="P19_TL00020"/>for a lot of former indiscretions on the part of the Theatre in the matter of producing<lb facs="P19_TL00021"/>Shakespeare in the florid Piccadilly manner.<lb facs="P19_TL00022"/>" Cool it with a baboon's blood,<lb facs="P19_TL00023"/>" Then the charm is firm and good ".<lb facs="P19_TL00024"/>Meantime, Public, what do you think of the whole matter?.... I mean to say, the expense<lb facs="P19_TL00025"/>has been estimated at a million sterling; a million so that a pack of amateurs can make<lb facs="P19_TL00026"/>sport of a giant. It is announced definitely that a public fund is contemplated; that is to<lb facs="P19_TL00027"/>say, dear Public, you pay at least half a million so that a National Theatre may be knocked<lb facs="P19_TL00028"/>together; and then, after it has been opened, you have got to pay for your seats, which<lb facs="P19_TL00029"/>at the end of ten years amounts to about another million out of your pockets. &lt;£&gt;<lb facs="P19_TL00030"/>Now, this is awfully spirited of you, but awfully foolish, because the beauty of<lb facs="P19_TL00031"/>Shakespeare is not going to be brought to you even if you pay twenty million. And let me<lb facs="P19_TL00032"/>tell you another thing which will remain true long after you and I are dead. It is that<lb facs="P19_TL00033"/>the Art of the Theatre is not going to come into this National Theatre, this Memorial to<lb facs="P19_TL00034"/>Shakespeare. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00035"/>You may think that if you give half a million of money to building a National Theatre<lb facs="P19_TL00036"/>you are doing the same for the Art of the Theatre as you are for the Art of Painting when<lb facs="P19_TL00037"/>you give the same sum to erecting a National Gallery. But the two things in no way<lb facs="P19_TL00038"/>resemble each other. In the National Gallery you have examples of all the great Masters<lb facs="P19_TL00039"/>of Europe. When they are purchased they are hung in their position and you may go to<lb facs="P19_TL00040"/>see them any year you like and you will find them as you last saw them. They have<lb facs="P19_TL00041"/>actually not been tampered with: they have positively not been made "up to date ": in<lb facs="P19_TL00042"/>short the Directors of the Gallery have not availed themselves of " every modern advantage<lb facs="P19_TL00043"/>the studios offer ". But if we had a National Theatre the managers of it would perhaps<lb facs="P19_TL00044"/>think they were producing Shakespeare " as he would have wished ", that is to say, they<lb facs="P19_TL00045"/>would avail themselves of all these " advantages " which the modern stage has to offer.<lb facs="P19_TL00046"/>Now, these advantages are positively disadvantages, and Shakespeare would have been<lb facs="P19_TL00047"/>the first to deride the idea of these tricks and decorations as bringing anything towards<lb facs="P19_TL00048"/>the interpretation of his stupendous drama. &amp; JS&gt; &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00049"/>&amp; Not that 1 am at all inclined to think that he would have advocated the old Elizabethan<lb facs="P19_TL00050"/>way of producing his plays today, but because one extreme is not right is no reason for<lb facs="P19_TL00051"/>rushing to the other. Indeed, both extremes are equally what may be described as "eccentric".<lb facs="P19_TL00052"/>What we have to find, if it is possible to find, is the right way of producing Shakespeare,<lb facs="P19_TL00053"/>....something in between these two extremes; something balanced. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00054"/>44 Tell me, (if your art<lb facs="P19_TL00055"/>Can tell so much), shall Banquo's issue ever<lb facs="P19_TL00056"/>Reign in this kingdom?</ab>

The Bra is responsible for the passage: the Daily Mail copies<lb facs="P20_TL00015"/>it, and thereby more than a million people are told that no one can afford to be purely<lb facs="P20_TL00016"/>artistic except the millionaire,... as if a man could be purely artistic by the grace of his<lb facs="P20_TL00017"/>millions! What does it mean? It reads like nonsense and yet I suppose there must be<lb facs="P20_TL00018"/>something in it. &lt;£? And yet again there seems to be nothing in it, for I know at least<lb facs="P20_TL00019"/>three people in England possessed of about twenty=four pounds sterling and a few tables and<lb facs="P20_TL00020"/>chairs, and who are yet entirely what can be described as " artistic. " &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00021"/>&amp; It is quite extraordinary how a certain set of Englishmen in responsible journalistic<lb facs="P20_TL00022"/>positions become utterly confused as to the reason of art, the means of bringing it about,<lb facs="P20_TL00023"/>and the kind of person who brings it about.<lb facs="P20_TL00024"/>&amp; Does the Bra perhaps mean that only a millionaire can afford to buy works of art because<lb facs="P20_TL00025"/>in England works of art are so expensive? If so this statement is entirely false. It is only<lb facs="P20_TL00026"/>works of extremely bad taste that are expensive..., expensive from every point of view. &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00027"/>&amp; Thus, in the theatre, we have a vulgar showy performance which costs, we are assured<lb facs="P20_TL00028"/>by the manager, ten thousand pounds; whereas a beautiful production on the stage<lb facs="P20_TL00029"/>costs far less than this if artists and good sound craftsmen are employed. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00030"/>&amp; The worst part of theatrical affairs in regard to productions in England is that the manager<lb facs="P20_TL00031"/>puts his job into the hands of " Firms. " &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00032"/>&amp; These Firms are very excellent and reliable in all matters pertaining to yards and<lb facs="P20_TL00033"/>inches, and these Firms also know how to charge so that their establishments shall be a<lb facs="P20_TL00034"/>success. All this is very creditable to them but it is disastrous to the theatre. &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00035"/>What the managers have never understood is that they should engage their stage<lb facs="P20_TL00036"/>managers, their scenic artists, their costumiers, their artistic advisers and all connected<lb facs="P20_TL00037"/>with the different works which are to be produced year after year in the same theatre,<lb facs="P20_TL00038"/>and they should never go to any other people but these when producing a work. These<lb facs="P20_TL00039"/>people would then all work hand in hand, would be as practical as any Firm, and, what is<lb facs="P20_TL00040"/>more, they would perhaps, through the gifts of one special artist in the theatre, produce<lb facs="P20_TL00041"/>works of great taste.<lb facs="P20_TL00042"/>This is the system which is beginning to be general in some few of the first theatres<lb facs="P20_TL00043"/>of Europe, and it works extremely satisfactorily. Everyone in the theatre is then more<lb facs="P20_TL00044"/>contented, and they are able to produce works of a better quality, and to produce any<lb facs="P20_TL00045"/>plays which they wish without consulting the public and without dread of bankruptcy. &amp;</ab>

So much I<lb facs="P22_TL00074"/>gathered from a short conversation with Mr<lb facs="P22_TL00075"/>Craig yesterday. &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00076"/>This attitude is explained by the above passage<lb facs="P22_TL00077"/>where I have pointed out that his whole heart<lb facs="P22_TL00078"/>is so entirely given over to the discovery of<lb facs="P22_TL00079"/>the principles of the art in its purest form<lb facs="P22_TL00080"/>that he no longer desires to fight with those<lb facs="P22_TL00081"/>people who hold opinions different from his<lb facs="P22_TL00082"/>own about this or that development of the<lb facs="P22_TL00083"/>modern theatre, the modern theatre having<lb facs="P22_TL00084"/>ceased to interest him beyond a certain extent.<lb facs="P22_TL00085"/>It is not, in fact, to different styles in the<lb facs="P22_TL00086"/>modern theatre that Mr Craig takes exception<lb facs="P22_TL00087"/>but to the entire theatre. That he should,<lb facs="P22_TL00088"/>notwithstanding this, be prepared to assist<lb facs="P22_TL00089"/>some of the modern directors with his ideas<lb facs="P22_TL00090"/>for bettering the artificiality of the theatre,<lb facs="P22_TL00091"/>and making that artificiality more distin*<lb facs="P22_TL00092"/>guished is much to Mr Craig's credit.<lb facs="P22_TL00093"/>Mr Craig is also engaged on work for the<lb facs="P22_TL00094"/>Moscow Art Theatre which will in part<lb facs="P22_TL00095"/>occupy him for at least twelve months. This<lb facs="P22_TL00096"/>statement will probably be piisunderstood in<lb facs="P22_TL00097"/>England unless it is explained that this work<lb facs="P22_TL00098"/>is not the preparation of eight or nine different<lb facs="P22_TL00099"/>productions which Mr Craig has to get ready<lb facs="P22_TL00100"/>by a certain date and in a certain way, so<lb facs="P22_TL00101"/>that it may " please the public. " Indeed I<lb facs="P22_TL00102"/>understand that M. Stanislawski's theatre in<lb facs="P22_TL00103"/>Moscow makes no attempt to please the<lb facs="P22_TL00104"/>public.... and invariably succeeds in pleasing<lb facs="P22_TL00105"/>without making the <lb facs="P22_TL00106"/>I also understand that when they produce a<lb facs="P22_TL00107"/>play in this theatre of Mr Stanislawski's in<lb facs="P22_TL00108"/>Moscow they devote as much time to it as the<lb facs="P22_TL00109"/>work demands instead of hurrying the work<lb facs="P22_TL00110"/>to fit the time. They do not set a certain<lb facs="P22_TL00111"/>date for a production and then rush the work<lb facs="P22_TL00112"/>through.

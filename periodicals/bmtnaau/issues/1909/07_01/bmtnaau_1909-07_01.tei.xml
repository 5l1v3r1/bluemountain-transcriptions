I cannot be familiar<lb facs="P5_TL00007"/>with what is above me, but I must be able to see it all, and what I see must be superb.<lb facs="P5_TL00008"/>Therefore God save the King!<lb facs="P5_TL00009"/>" All Architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it ". (i) and if my<lb facs="P5_TL00010"/>king wanted to chop off my head I think I would submit cheerfully and dance to the block<lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>for the sake of preserving my ideal of Kingship. &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>Kings have given us everything.... and we in times gone by have in return made up the<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>splendid procession which follows in their wake. Kings have not stopped giving us everything,<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>but we have lately given up forming the splendid processions. We have lost the trick of it<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>because we are losing the old power of our eyes and our other senses. Our senses,.... those<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>wonderful servants of ours over whom we reign as king,.... our senses have rebelled. So<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>that it comes to this: that we on our part have lost our royalty. Our senses have had the<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>vanity to revolt. This is infinitely disgusting. Our senses, if you please, are permitting<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>themselves the luxury of becoming tired. They Want another ruler than the 50u1,... and<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>expect Jupiter to send them a better. We have pampered our intellect so much of late, have<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>searched the archives of knowledge at so great an expense, that we have bargained our<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>senses away to our unimaginative reason. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>&amp; It costs all this to become practical today; our imagination is the price we pay. It seems<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>that in the Garden of Paradise, the world, there are as many trees of knowledge as there<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>are men, so that it will no longer do to put our continual yearly " fall " down to woman,<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>and we had surely better try to support her bitter laughter than that harsher scorn of the<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>gods. <lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>&amp; And the gods are laughing! My God, so entirely peerless, laughs only with his eyes.<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>He laughs on all the day and I hear the echo of his laughter all the night. But I know how<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>nobly all has been arranged in this Garden, for my God's laughter is as the song of Para<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>dise in my ears, and its pale echo soothes me to sleep through the night. &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>&amp; And as surely as this bounteous laughter pours down on me by day and flows away<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>from me by night, so will I find some way of giving thanks for it all: thanksgiving to the<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>joyous laughter. &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>But to many ears this laughter of the Gods is like the shrieking of a storm, and these<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>people raise their eyebrows, grumble, and pray that it will pass. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>&amp; But will It pass? Will it not shriek in their ears until they be dead,... until they have<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>lost the sense of hearing? JET<lb facs="P5_TL00039"/>&amp; Better would it be for these beings to value once more their most noble servants the<lb facs="P5_TL00040"/>senses, and attempt to perceive by their means the full meaning of the voice and of the<lb facs="P5_TL00041"/>face of God. And when they have understood that they will see the full meaning of the<lb facs="P5_TL00042"/>King. <lb facs="P5_TL00043"/>&amp; If I worship the sun 1 cannot listen to the talk which twaddles on about the tyranny<lb facs="P5_TL00044"/>of kings. The sun is for me the greatest of tyrants; that, in fact, is part of my reason for<lb facs="P5_TL00045"/>loving the sun.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00004"/>&lt;0 All truth,... the truth of tyranny no less than the truth of slavery, is illumined by the<lb facs="P6_TL00005"/>sun. From the marble columns of Mount Carrara to the wrinkle on the face of my nurse,<lb facs="P6_TL00006"/>all is laid bare for me; nothing escapes the eye of God. He is a terrible God to those who<lb facs="P6_TL00007"/>will not be burnt by him. From these he will " breed maggots &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00008"/>&amp; The Beautiful and the Terrible. Which is which will never be put into words. But I am<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>free to tell myself; and, let me but preserve the senses,... my eyes, my ears, my touch, and<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>all shall be we 11,... all shall be far more beautiful than terrible. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>&amp; For not only do these servants of our Royalty help to idealise all things for us, but<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>they also help to fix a limit to our vanity. By their help 1 recognise my God as he rises<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>like the spirit of Imagination from the East and sails across the blue straits of Heaven.<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>&amp; If I had lost the sense of sight I should be unable to see this glory, and, not seeing it,<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>I shoul ddemand more miracles from it than Happiness may expect. I should look for the<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>practical daily miracle in vain. Whereas, seeing this daily glory, this Sun, I know that the<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>miracle comes and goes, that the miracle is the passage of this symbol of the Divine, this<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>seeming motion of the Sun from east to west. &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>And that seeming motion of this God is enough for man to know. Mystic voices seem<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>to cry, " Seek to know no more "5 and we answer rebelliously, " I will be satisfied; deny<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>me this and an eternal curse fall on ye " &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>" .... Show his eyes and grieve his heart,<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>Come like shadows, so depart. "<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>This seeking to know more,... this desire of the brain,... robs our senses of their vita<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>lity; our eyes are dim; we can no longer recognise the God before us, nor the King as he<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>passes along our way. Our ears are deaf; we cannot hear the song of Paradise, we fail to<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>pick up the chorus which follows in the wake of Royalty.Our touch is grown coarse. The<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>hem of the robes' brocade was once pleasant to our fingers' touch; to press upon the silken<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>glove with our lips was once a luxury. Now we have become the mob; ambition's aim,...<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>noble consummation. Afraid to serve like noblemen we must slave like thieves,'having rob<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00004"/>&amp; Could you curl up a little more?" said Miss Ellen Terry at a recent rehearsal to a<lb facs="P7_TL00005"/>small elf swinging precariously in mid«air on a bending bough. " 1 used to come down curled<lb facs="P7_TL00006"/>up on a big leaf when 1 was a fairy."<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>When she was a Fairy indeed! As if Miss Terry does not know better than most<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>people that once a Fairy, always a Fairy. And this brings us to the beginning of our story.<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>&amp; Once upon a time there was a very ugly Age. Perhaps not quite as ugly as this: the<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>motor bus and the aroplane were unknown, but on the other hand there were chignons<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>and large gold lockets and crochet antimaccassars and ornaments for your fire stove, and<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>bricks were covered with stucco and doors were 'grained' in imitation of whatever wood<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>they did not happen to be.<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>&amp; Now all this was very sad, and though of course Beauty was in the midst of it, as she<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>always is, looking charming in her full, plain skirts ahd her sloped away shoulders and<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>her trim little bonnets, yet she did not like her surroundings, and at last she felt that she<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>could put up with them no longer. So she called at the nearest Fairy Ring and laid the<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>whole matter before the Folk in Green and asked for advice. £&gt; &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>The Fairies, who are always ready to do Beauty a good turn, gave the subject their<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>full consideration, and finally said that they would see about it and that it should be all<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>right. Then they set to work. And they collected wildfire and May dew and the<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>whispering of leaves and the dancing of waters and the daffodils of dawn and the roses<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>of sunset, and they packed them up very carefully into a very neat and very small parcel<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>and they called the parcel Ellen Terry and sent it to an address in Coventry which nobody<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>can remember.... right into the great big ugly world. Then they waited results. £&gt;<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>First of all nothing in particular happened. The little parcel of Fairy Goods adapted<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>itself to the situation and pretended to be an ordinary baby; developing therefrom into<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>an ordinary little girl. So ordinary did she seem that her parents could think of nothing<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>better for her to do than to go on to the stage and act plays to make people laugh or<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>cry: a career which, I need hardly point out, any thoroughly good and 'properly brought<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>up' child would 5c0rn...... and quite rightly too, as she would be no manner of use in it.<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>But then occurred a curious thing. Among the parts which the baby from Fairyland<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>was asked to play was a First Fairy.... the first of all Fairies.... Puck. It was a dangerous<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>experiment. The playing of Puck, Ellen Terry herself acknowledges, produced a marked<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>effect upon her chiid~mind: she became wild and wayward, impatient of restraint,a romp,<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>as she expresses it; and when Puck in his turn gave place to the Good Fairy Goldenstar,<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>whose robes were 'gold, pink and trailing' to the deep satisfaction of the wearer,... well<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>we may consider ourselves lucky that Ellen Terry is still with us. It was the call of the<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>blood, and the only wonder is that the Fairy Child, grown homesick, did not then and<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>there disappear up the chimney after the approved manner of changelings.<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>&amp; Perhaps the soothing effect of becoming 'top angel* in Henry VIII may have saved the<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>situation: anyhow, Ellen Terry stayed. More parts were given to her, though as yet no<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>more Fairy parts, but the ordinary little girl began to feel her disguise more difficult to<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>sustain, and was very nearly found out, qpon several occasions, to be a very extraordinary<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>little girl indeed.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00006"/>&amp; At last at Bath, that lovely ghost of a long-ago city, where little Ellen Terry must have<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>loved to wander and to feel exquisitely old and sad (which is great fun so long as we are<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>only pretending)... came an important rise in social position, and the former Puck became<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>Titania, Queen of Faerie.<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>A friend showed her how to make a real Fairy dress and how to damp it and wring it<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>and shake it out "all crinkled and clinging"; and that night saw the first appearance of the<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>real Ellen Terry, the Fairy lady with the wonderful message of beauty from that Country<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>East of the Sun and West of the Moon. <lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>But before she could deliver it properly she had to go away by herself and think. &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>j? She knew pretty nearly all about the stage by this time, (Fairies ar© so quick-witted)<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>and now she had to learn about the great world outside the theatre, to know the quiet<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>places of the earth and the many voices of silence. She had to find out all about washing<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>days and babies' underclothes and how to harness ponies and how very exclusive goats<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>are ; andshe had to wratch the dawn walking over the meadows in her trailing robes of<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>shimmering mist and the dance of merry mayflies in the sun. And, in these quiet years<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>that came to her, she gathered all these things and sorted them and wove them into a<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>wonderful coloured web of poetry and fantasy out of which she has taken dress-lengths<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>ever since without exhausting the supply, although her gowns are very long and sweeping<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>and must cut into a great deal of material. &amp; JZ? &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>&amp; But one day, as she sat in her bower of quiet weaving her web, there rod© by... not<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>exactly Lancelot.... but a friendly playwright and manager, and, as he passed, she ran to<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>the window and 'look'd down to Camelot'. So of course the spell was broken and she had<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>to go back to town which she found just as ugly as ever, and poor Beauty in its midst<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>very much depressed and fearing that the fairies had forgotten all about her.<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>&amp; But then the charm began to work. &amp; <lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>&amp; As the coming of rain to a parched field, as the coming of Spring to the frost-bound<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>wood, so was the coming of Ellen Terry to the mid-Victorian world. At her touch the<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>antimaccassars melted from the chairs, the bead and woolwork roses faded from the tables<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>and in their stead sprang crocus and daffodil, the ornaments for your firestove were swept<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>up the chimney and seen no more. No one could contemplate Ellen Terry an evening<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>through and then go home and crochet or make paper roses. It could not be done. The<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>spell of the Fairy Lady lay upon the length and breadth of the land, and after her flocked<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>the poet and the painter: spring was in the air and the world of Art went a-maying.<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>For the pretty little Miss, with a fan like a charming tea spoon, who had for so long<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>queened it at the studios, vanished with the wool flowers and the antimaccassars, and upon<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>all the canvasses grew the shadow of that unpaintable face the strong chin, the firm<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>mouth with its wonderful lines, so generous and yet so sensitive and tender, the strange<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>pale eyes, wistful, questioning, ever with a hint of tears in their very brightness.... a unique<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>face which has never been before and never will be again, the gladdest, saddest face in all<lb facs="P8_TL00045"/>the w0r1d...,, and yet, a face which, had it belonged to some other, might have passed<lb facs="P8_TL00046"/>unnoticed; for Ellen Terry, among her many creations, created her own beauty. &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00047"/>Perhaps no other face has produced such a marked effect upon the Art of it's time.<lb facs="P8_TL00048"/>The Fairy Lady was not 'classical'; she did not lend herself to 'genre'. So the painters,<lb facs="P8_TL00049"/>deserting the Academic and the Popular, removed in a body to Camelot or Lyonesse and<lb facs="P8_TL00050"/>there sketched backgrounds in the forest of Broceliande wherein to enshrine the inevitable<lb facs="P8_TL00051"/>figure. Guinevere and the Lady of Shalott completely cut out Miss Dolly Varden, and even<lb facs="P8_TL00052"/>angels, hitherto regarded as rather dull persons, became quite sought after, having, of<lb facs="P8_TL00053"/>course, conformed as far as possible to the new ideal. "Back to the Fairy Land" commanded<lb facs="P8_TL00054"/>Ellen Terry, and back to Fairy Land we all trooped, and a very delightful time we had there.<lb facs="P8_TL00055"/>Let us call to mind scenes and characters which she has deliberately fairified.<lb facs="P8_TL00056"/>&amp; A space of sky and sea over which a great storm passes away in angry sunset fires; a<lb facs="P8_TL00057"/>lonely figure high on a rock against the flaming west. The voice comes softly, wistfully....<lb facs="P8_TL00058"/>"What country, friend, is this?" "IHyria, lady" answers a seaman. But this Viola knew<lb facs="P8_TL00059"/>better. She knew that she was in her native land of Faerie, and she moved through the<lb facs="P8_TL00060"/>fantastic Twelfth Night Masque a dream maid in a dream country, unemphatic, uninsistant,<lb facs="P8_TL00061"/>with gentle hesitating gesture and with voice low-pitched, as fearing to break the spell of<lb facs="P8_TL00062"/>it's own music.

As Imogen,<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>'too, it must be recorded that the Fairy Lady for once forgot her mortal disguise and<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>actually flew. As she read the false letter bidding her rejoin her husband at Milford Haven,<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>she seemed to be caught up in a whirlwind of joy, the giddy terrible joy which needs must<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>turn quickly to sorrow or hearts would break. "O for a horse with wings!" she cried,<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>springing forward with outstretched arms: the rest of the speech she gave in the air,<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>hovering a while over the stage, then darting away with the swift rush of a swallow,<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>leaving her audience amazed and breathless. <lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>&amp; What Ellen Terry has done with good parts we all know: what she has done with bad<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>parts some of us, perhaps, do not quite realise. 'Rosamund' in 'Becket' fairly puzzled the<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>actress. "She is not a woman", she said, "She is nothing... she does not live." Then<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>presumably, she tried to remember all she had heard elsewhere concerning Miss de Clifford.<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>"She was called faire Rosamund," she probably said. "Very well, she shall be fair." And<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>with that she so clothed the part in beauty, so hung if about with loveliness that it waked<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>into existence and held its own with the other strong characters of the play. &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>it is a wonderful experience to see a great actress in a great part yet it is almost<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>equally interesting to an enquiring mind to see her in a bad one. Thus everyone should<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>make a point of seeing Ellen Terry in the part which she is playing at present which is<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>unquestionably the worst she has ever undertaken and altogether unworthy of her genius.<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>But it is in a Fairy Play.<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>same nostalgia which made 'Puck' restless and unmanageable, which filled the 'Fairy<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>Goldenstar' with pride of place... and costume.... has drawn the Fairy Lady into the Fairy<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>Ring again. She could not keep out of it. She has no business in it.... and she knows it,....<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>but there she is. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>As a discerning critic of about eight,seeing her for the first time, observed, "If she had<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>been Cinderella I should have liked her awfully, but she was just an Aunt!" Ellen Terry an<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>Aunt! Not even a Fairy Godmother.<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>In justice to the author we must state that he was appalled when Miss Terry offered<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>cto take the part. "But... you'll have to be commonplace," he faltered. "I'll be commonplace,'<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>said Miss Terry, "and uninteresting," Now let those who have seen Ellen Terry's enchanting<lb facs="P9_TL00037"/>'Aunt Imogen' bear witness how the poor man's confidence has been abused and how obvious<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>it is that Fairy women are no more to be trusted than the usual kind. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>&amp; But the Wonderful Lady must not be blamed. She can no more divest herself of her<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>rown of stars and her gossamer robes than a rose can become a radish. She is still the Dreams<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>Lady of a dreamless day, whispering her message of beauty to the world, scattering elfin gift,<lb facs="P9_TL00042"/>with both hands and, as yet, unjoined by any other Wanderer from the Other Side of the Moon<lb facs="P9_TL00043"/>She is still Ellen Terry, First,... and, as far as we can see, Last....

Why should we rate the Shakespearian audiences higher than he did himself ? Is<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>it not a fact that Shakespeare mocks at audiences in "Hamlet"? It is always the audience<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>who in order to arrive at certain cheap effects spoils the actor and can never understand<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>and appreciate the real poet. That an audience without the proper scenic environment,<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>without decorations, entered into the imaginary pictures of the poet is not due to its naivity<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>or to its receptiveness but to the peculiar, one may say unique, dramatic art which since<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>then has been so imperfectly imitated and which is so perfectly revealed in Shakespeare's<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>dialogue.<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>The mediaeval stage which had gradually developed to the time of the English Renaissance<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>and become part of it, became by virtue of its lack of magnificence and its primitiveness<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>the stage of unlimited possibilities. It does not remind us of the stage of the Italian<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>Renaissance which had for each division of dramatic art a fixed and set environment, tried<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>to preserve the appearance of reality and was willing to court the clamours of the audience.<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>Neither did the English stage resemble the stage of Corneille or Racine who allowed all their<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>tragic subjects to develop amid staid and abstract environments. The English stage could<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>create an entire world as soon as the poet appeared in whose soul slumbered a world for itself.<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>But this stage expects every thing from the poet even down to the decorations; on this<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>stage there is no painter, no regisseur of stage or light; only the poet and the actor are left<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>to themselves here. The word is supreme and Shakespeare alone creates the decorations<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>and illuminates the play every night with magic quickness. Therein lies the secret and<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>the explanation why Shakespeare's dialogue gives such a wide scope to the purely poetic and<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>picturesque elements. As there had not yet been a stage of illusions, it was the task to<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>arrive at illusions through purely poetic mediums. It was necessary for the poet to suggest<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>to his audiences various kinds of decorations. A greater master of this art of suggestion<lb facs="P10_TL00044"/>has never lived and there has been no theater director other than Shakespeare who disposed<lb facs="P10_TL00045"/>of a greater wealth of decorations. There are the fairy woods in "Midsummernight's<lb facs="P10_TL00046"/>Dream " with the cowslips in golden coats spotted with rubies, the bower of Titania of<lb facs="P10_TL00047"/>wild roses and violets on a bank whereon the wild thyme blows. There is the prologue in<lb facs="P10_TL00048"/>"The Merchant of Venice"<lb facs="P10_TL00049"/>".... where your argosies with portly sails,<lb facs="P10_TL00050"/>" Like signors and rich burghers of the flood,<lb facs="P10_TL00051"/>•' Or as it were, the pageants of the sea<lb facs="P10_TL00052"/>" Do overpeer the petty traffickers,<lb facs="P10_TL00053"/>" That curt'sy to them, do them reverence,<lb facs="P10_TL00054"/>(i As they fly by them with their woven wings."<lb facs="P10_TL00055"/>There is in the fifth act the garden of Portia where to the lovemaking of Jessica and<lb facs="P10_TL00056"/>Lorenzo,</ab>

There is the monastic garden of Friar Laurence in 44 Romeo<lb facs="P11_TL00008"/>and Juliet" in the brilliancy of the early morning light, the castle of Inverness with its<lb facs="P11_TL00009"/>deceptive swallows' nests, the dark cave of the witches, the terrace of Elsinore where the<lb facs="P11_TL00010"/>ghost of Hamlet's father appears in full armour, the heath in storm where King Lear tears<lb facs="P11_TL00011"/>his white hair, all these pictures of the stage receive life solely through the suggestive<lb facs="P11_TL00012"/>power of the poetic diction. And how generous Shakespeare is with the light effects<lb facs="P11_TL00013"/>considering that he has on his stage no apparatuses for this purpose at his disposal. In<lb facs="P11_TL00014"/>everyone of his plays the change of time is noted which means a change of light. &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00015"/>&amp; Shakespeare is most resourceful in this and he does not miss an opportunity to bring<lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>out every shade and color in the way of lighting assisted by his diction. In the garden<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>scene of 44 The Merchant of Venice44 he simply announces (Lorenzo) 44the moon shines<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>brightin 44 Midsummer night's Dream " diction is put into the service of the most up to<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>date light effects and it is worth while to note in how many different ways Shakespeare<lb facs="P11_TL00020"/>plays about with the magic light of the moon. With each change of light a change of<lb facs="P11_TL00021"/>decoration takes place and the scenic pictures thus created are positively astounding in<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>richness of color showing visions of the greatest conception. &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>&amp;It is here that the foundation of Shakespeare's dramatic art is to be found. Here is a<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>great poetic genius changing magically through the power of verbal expression a wooden<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>structure into a stage capable of any transformation and suggesting to his public scenic<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>pictures of such diversity and with such intensity that centuries later the most ingenious<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>contrivances of a modern stage structure, built for producing illusions, fail to give life to<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>a Shakespearian drama without experiencing the disappointment that in spite of all the<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>machinery it is not possible to realize the ideas of the poet. From the standpoint of the<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>modern drama such a monopoly of the decorative and lyric element is a hindrance of the<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>purely dramatic in the dialogue. A differentiation has gradually taken place and it is<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>interesting to notice how the dramatic in the dialogue has gradually separated from all<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>lyric and decorative side issues since the days of the Greek tragedians. The Greek tragedy<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>could place nearly all the necessities of decoration on the stage: a wonderful architecture,<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>the blue dome of the sky, evolutions of rythmic—decorative beauty and mechanical apparatuses<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>of much ingenuity were at its disposal. The lyric part however was in the Greek tragedy<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>as chorus a parallel counterpart to the dramatic dialogue and gradually declines in the<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>course of development. In Shakespeare all the lyric and decorative 44 motifs" are woven<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>into the dialogue. Shakespeare's dialogue is both decorative, lyric and dramatic. The<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>modern drama however places everything decorative within the frame of the stage in form<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>of separate explanations which accompany the dialogue. The lyric part as such loses its<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>independence and is involved in the dramatic expression which creates atmosphere or<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>Stimmung and presupposes an art of acting consisting of silences and secretiveness<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>which had been hitherto unknown or, at least, until quite modern times. <lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>&amp; The Shakespearian drama finds two kinds of obstacles in our modern theatre; the first<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>is to be found in the stage structure which is built to produce illusions and the second in<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>the differentiation of the art of acting. For both purposes the Shakespearian text is much<lb facs="P11_TL00048"/>too broad, too profuse. The second difficulty is comparatively easily overcome. It means<lb facs="P11_TL00049"/>the cutting out of unnecessary words, the substitution of the word by mimic art which<lb facs="P11_TL00050"/>will always remain individual. Actors with rhetoric tendencies always depend on the full<lb facs="P11_TL00051"/>value of the word while real mimic actors only look for the suggestions in order to preserve<lb facs="P11_TL00052"/>the independence of their art. &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00053"/>&amp; Much more difficult however is the question of the scenic environment. What shall be<lb facs="P11_TL00054"/>the relation of a modern stage to the decorations created by Shakespeare in his dramatic<lb facs="P11_TL00055"/>text? if everyone of Shakespeare's words is also realised in picture-form on the stage, his<lb facs="P11_TL00056"/>suggestive descriptions must act like pleonasms. Therefore the purely poetic suggestion<lb facs="P11_TL00057"/>would cease to be necessary. The revolving stage with its realistic pictures and its drastic<lb facs="P11_TL00058"/>cuts is no solution. The lengths of the intermissions are reduced, but the disturbing</ab>

On the other hand is<lb facs="P12_TL00005"/>not a return to the Shakespearian stage a rather hopeless task if one considers the majority<lb facs="P12_TL00006"/>of the spectators? For after all a theatre is not a philological society. The public cannot<lb facs="P12_TL00007"/>easily get away from deeply rooted ideas and prejudices and is only willing to accept<lb facs="P12_TL00008"/>certain possible illusions, possibilities which the Shakespearian stage cannot give. &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00009"/>I believe the right thing to be done is what Shakespeare suggested himself, is poetic<lb facs="P12_TL00010"/>suggestions shall be supported on a modern stage by painted scenic sugggestion.

Through his own reflections and<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>his own experiences he had arrived at this conclusion, the nucleous of which corresponds<lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>with the ideas which The Mask has been founded to support.

That scene is<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>also, for the same reason, important as preparation for the appearance of the children in<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>the last Act. &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&lt;&amp;&lt;&amp;'&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>&amp; I mentioned the servant maids, " les servantes "... Their appearance in the first and in<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>the last Act certainly did not give the right impression of their character. In the first<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>scene there was far too little style, the whole was too light and too trifling. It ought to<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>be a prolonged prologue that opens the gates of fate,... the same gates that close with a<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>clang in the fourth Act, when the fate of Pelleas and Melisande is to be sealed. The spirit<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>of the Greek tragedy of fate lies in this brief scene, and the servant maids,... the chorus....<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>are much more closely related to Aeschylus than to the novices in an operatic nunnery,<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>whom here they much resemble.

And in the last Act it is in the sudden and<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>absolutely simultaneous kneeling that the moment is fixed when the Parces cut the vital<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>thread of Melisande. £? &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>There are some scenes in which the secret language, about which Maeterlinck speaks,<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>ought to be heard especially clearly, and which therefore ought to have been studied more<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>carefully.

Lastly, as<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>artist of the theatre, (and his dramas, of which almost every one presents a fresh problem<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>in theatrical form and original scenic experiments, give him the right to this title), Wyspianski<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>belongs to those few, very few good Spirits of the Theatre who desire its Delivrance. <lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>&amp; He died November 28th, 1907.

But at the same time, while writing and thinking out the destiny of<lb facs="P21_TL00011"/>"any of his dramatic figures, he knew that such a part would be played by such and such<lb facs="P21_TL00012"/>an actor. And if even it sometimes happened that with this or that actor he spoke of<lb facs="P21_TL00013"/>"some part, they always spoke of this or that personage so as to divine it,..if independent,<lb facs="P21_TL00014"/>„and not of whether to tack or sew on to some part this or that something which came<lb facs="P21_TL00015"/>"into somebody's head".

But it would be very wrong to think that Wyspianski in writing his dramas thought<lb facs="P22_TL00046"/>exclusively of the small stage of the Cracow theatre. He knew all too well that a theatre<lb facs="P22_TL00047"/>carrying on a financial speculation did a great deal on its part in extending hospitality to<lb facs="P22_TL00048"/>hardly a third of his dramas, the reproduction of which always involved fresh expenses and<lb facs="P22_TL00049"/>exacted an immense outlay of work. He knew this, and never made a compromise with this<lb facs="P22_TL00050"/>state of affairs. He created the greater part of his dramas with the thought of another<lb facs="P22_TL00051"/>theatre, well known to his imagination: with the thought of other actors with whom he<lb facs="P22_TL00052"/>associated in his dreams. In writing them he applied to them the Shakespearean method,<lb facs="P22_TL00053"/>as likewise to the dramas he destined for the contemporary stage. One must understand<lb facs="P22_TL00054"/>however that when he began his artistic process he was different from what he was when<lb facs="P22_TL00055"/>he terminated it: that he was forming himself in the course of each such play ". (i)<lb facs="P22_TL00056"/>&amp; He wrote these dramas for his own Ideal Stage, controlling their effect on the boards<lb facs="P22_TL00057"/>of this stage, reckoning with the demands of an ideal amphitheatre. Hence the differences<lb facs="P22_TL00058"/>between the 44 editio princeps " of an unplayed drama and its following editions; hence the<lb facs="P22_TL00059"/>alterations, corrections and improvements. &amp; &amp; &amp;</ab>

Receiving the secret meaning of the legends of these two worlds, which<lb facs="P30_TL00019"/>every product of popular imagination conceals in its primitive form, he unites them with<lb facs="P30_TL00020"/>the logic, examined by himself, of the later heroic periods, and he so connects these two<lb facs="P30_TL00021"/>categories of material that they may serve him as the basis for the Leading Historical Idea.<lb facs="P30_TL00022"/>&amp; And this first cycle formed by dramas woven 011 the ground of Polish myths and legends:<lb facs="P30_TL00023"/>44 The Legend 44 Boleslas the Bold ", 44 The Rock together with the dramas, so-called<lb facs="P30_TL00024"/>Greek,.... 44 Achilles ",44 The Return of Odysseus ", 44 Protesilas and Laodamia ",44 Meleager "5<lb facs="P30_TL00025"/>this first cycle singing of olden glory and which closes with the prophetic drama under the<lb facs="P30_TL00026"/>title of 44 Acropolis ", unites by an historical thread with the second cycle embracing dramas<lb facs="P30_TL00027"/>whose substance is the history of the Insurrection and Martyrdom of the Polish Nation:<lb facs="P30_TL00028"/>44 The November Night ", 44 La Varsovienne ", 44 Lelewel ", 44 The Legion and the staging<lb facs="P30_TL00029"/>of Mickiewicz's 44 Feast of the Dead The second cycle is a fantasy on the events of the<lb facs="P30_TL00030"/>44 November Insurrection " (1830=31831) and its historical consequences, is a rhapsody whirring<lb facs="P30_TL00031"/>with the rustle of the wings of the last Napoleonic eagles, flying away with the autumn<lb facs="P30_TL00032"/>gale from the 44 land of mounds and crosses " (1).

The Legend says that formerly in dusky times<lb facs="P31_TL00016"/>on this hill, rising on the banks of the Vistula, on whose sandy bed, in coralline palaces<lb facs="P31_TL00017"/>sing Undines, settled the Chief of Chrobatia of the name of Cracus and built himself a<lb facs="P31_TL00018"/>wooden mansion. And in this mountain an insatiable dragon had its den and fed on the<lb facs="P31_TL00019"/>blood of the prince's serfs, and was always hungering for fresh victims. This monster<lb facs="P31_TL00020"/>Cracus killed with his own hand; and the legend speaks of Wanda, his royal daughter, who,<lb facs="P31_TL00021"/>rather than give her hand to the German Prince Rytogar, wedded her virginal body to the<lb facs="P31_TL00022"/>Vistula. The grateful people raised barrows to the heroic warrior and beloved maiden, and<lb facs="P31_TL00023"/>handed down to posterity a simple tale of them. And afterwards in this castle kings ruled,<lb facs="P31_TL00024"/>wielding the terrible glaive jagged on the gates of besieged burgs.

Once a year is to<lb facs="P31_TL00039"/>be heard the blast of the horn and the neighing of the horses; then King Boleslas the<lb facs="P31_TL00040"/>Valiant can be seen passing with iron steps across the jousting court with the angelic<lb facs="P31_TL00041"/>glaive glistening on his shoulder. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00042"/>&amp; Today the bell "Sigismundus" rings for Midnight Mass, and for the Resurrection, when<lb facs="P31_TL00043"/>in the Polish soul, as in the holy manger, Christ is born, and when in this soul as in the<lb facs="P31_TL00044"/>holy sepulchre rises again. &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00045"/>&amp; One of the legends of Wawel touches directly the temple under the patronage of St<lb facs="P31_TL00046"/>Michael and standing on "The Rock " (Skalka) • There, according to the oldest chroniclers,<lb facs="P31_TL00047"/>King Boleslas the Bold commanded his sbirris to put Bishop Stanislas Szczepanowski to death,<lb facs="P31_TL00048"/>for his having dared to excommunicate him " from bread and aeres, from strength and<lb facs="P31_TL00049"/>willand when an invisible power held their swords in the air, they being cast to the<lb facs="P31_TL00050"/>ground by it, the bold king cleft the bishop through the head and ordered his body to be<lb facs="P31_TL00051"/>hacked into seventy two parts.

On Wawel Wyspianski's<lb facs="P32_TL00016"/>art is born. On Wawel Wyspianski's art takes its beginning; there it arrives at its tragic<lb facs="P32_TL00017"/>moment, and, at last at its apogee is delivered. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P32_TL00018"/>&amp; Wyspianski recasts the Wawel themes not only on the stage but also ip poetry, in<lb facs="P32_TL00019"/>rhapsodies such as " Casimir the Great" and " Boleslas the Bold/" in painting,...landscape,<lb facs="P32_TL00020"/>composition and ornamentation. &amp;<lb facs="P32_TL00021"/>&amp; Wyspianski regarded the stage, however, as the most suitable frame for these themes,<lb facs="P32_TL00022"/>purely theatrical in the noblest sense of the word, and although he treats them in another<lb facs="P32_TL00023"/>form, that only testifies to the fact that, like Shakespeare "he had always reality in his<lb facs="P32_TL00024"/>thoughts, reality in his imagination "that always "the men of his drama lived in his ima<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

For it suffices to arrange<lb facs="P32_TL00027"/>the text of the rhapsodies for voices, translate it into mimic ianguage, for them to become<lb facs="P32_TL00028"/>scenic spectacles of the first water. &amp; 4? <lb facs="P32_TL00029"/>With equal strength the theatrical elements of his talent express themselves in his<lb facs="P32_TL00030"/>landscapes, compositions or decorative projects. The most eloquent proof of this gravitation<lb facs="P32_TL00031"/>of vision to theatrical forms we see in the stained glass windows by Wyspianski destined<lb facs="P32_TL00032"/>for the Cathedral on Wawel. These are no longer anecdotes such as formerly were depicted<lb facs="P32_TL00033"/>ornamentally with thought but about their chromatic effect, but dramatic scenes expressed<lb facs="P32_TL00034"/>In theatrical drawing and colouring in such away that the figures under the influence of<lb facs="P32_TL00035"/>light appear in the recesses of the cathedral windows as those spectres of the past with<lb facs="P32_TL00036"/>which Wyspianski's stage swarms.<lb facs="P32_TL00037"/>It appears that alread3? in the moment when Wyspianski composed these " Wawel dramas"<lb facs="P32_TL00038"/>on glass, destining them for the cathedral amphitheatre, he was governed by the thought<lb facs="P32_TL00039"/>of enlarging his theatre, which had become crystallised only in the project for the building<lb facs="P32_TL00040"/>over of the Wawel hill, published after his death under the title " Wawel-Acropolis ".

For, in the crowd appearing in Wyspianski's theatre, there is nothing<lb facs="P37_TL00014"/>that would remind one of the individualisation of the supernumeraries or of the famed<lb facs="P37_TL00015"/>" Rhabarbergemurnae! der Massen,, to which innovations the management "des hin-un-und<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Still, it may have had its share of<lb facs="P47_TL00030"/>those evening performances at which, according to Conti, the most riotous scenes took<lb facs="P47_TL00031"/>place. It is true that it had been opened for the Court also to visit, but apparently such<lb facs="P47_TL00032"/>visits were not continued, being paid instead to the more dignified performances at the<lb facs="P47_TL00033"/>Pergola,.... perhaps owing to the coarse and realistic style of play most in favour in the<lb facs="P47_TL00034"/>smaller theatres.<lb facs="P47_TL00035"/>&amp; At these the people usually arrived early, with pots of stew or lamb, bread and flasks<lb facs="P47_TL00036"/>of wine, which they consumed in the semi-darkness that, lighted only by three or four oil<lb facs="P47_TL00037"/>lamps, reigned until the curtain rose.

The<lb facs="P51_TL00025"/>pathos of the situation of a man who has spent his life making mistakes in the Theatre is<lb facs="P51_TL00026"/>augmented by this trembling confession of the reasons which have induced him to so great<lb facs="P51_TL00027"/>a folly "I like reading plays, buying plays, producing plays."<lb facs="P51_TL00028"/>If Mr Prohman reads a few plays it will do nobody any harm.

And buying plays is only a little more expensive.<lb facs="P51_TL00030"/>As for producing plays, has Mr Frohman produced a play in his life? We believe that he<lb facs="P51_TL00031"/>has not and cannot; and, being incapable, he is obliged to employ others to do his work of<lb facs="P51_TL00032"/>44 producing.<lb facs="P51_TL00033"/>Compare, for instance, Mr Frohman with Mr Arthur Collins, and you soon see what is<lb facs="P51_TL00034"/>the difference between an amateur and a professional. &amp;<lb facs="P51_TL00035"/>Mr Arthur Collins has worked his way from the position of call-boy to that of manager<lb facs="P51_TL00036"/>of Drury Lane,... and without any skipping of the difficulties. Mr Collins is a well-equipped<lb facs="P51_TL00037"/>manager and understands all the crafts which he employs to produce his effects. He can write<lb facs="P51_TL00038"/>you a play if necessary; act you a difficult part, rehearse two hundred supers with success*<lb facs="P51_TL00039"/>design and paint with his own hands any scenes he may need,... and added to all this is a<lb facs="P51_TL00040"/>shrewd man of affairs. The net result is Old Drury,... a national asset. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P51_TL00041"/>It is Mr Collins who should be given the control of the many London Theatres which<lb facs="P51_TL00042"/>Mr Frohman plays about with. &amp;<lb facs="P51_TL00043"/>Why? Because Mr Collins is an Englishman and thorough, and because Mr Frohman<lb facs="P51_TL00044"/>being an American and 44 more of a sentimentalist than a business man " could possibly<lb facs="P51_TL00045"/>be of great value in his own land, but is valueless or worse in ours. £/ &amp;</ab>

In any discussion of this stage, howe=&gt;<lb facs="P56_TL00014"/>ver, the first point to emphasize is that it was<lb facs="P56_TL00015"/>for the Shakespearean period; the next, whe<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

We believe this latter to<lb facs="P56_TL00020"/>be the case, for the main need, the matter<lb facs="P56_TL00021"/>of radical importance, in a stage, is that it<lb facs="P56_TL00022"/>should be in harmony with the play or per<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Therefore he would willingly<lb facs="P56_TL00072"/>witness his plays being performed before<lb facs="P56_TL00073"/>twenty different realistic scenes which would<lb facs="P56_TL00074"/>swiftly switch the beholders' thoughts from<lb facs="P56_TL00075"/>one idea on to another. From " Battlements<lb facs="P56_TL00076"/>and a rising moon, etc, etc," to "A Palace<lb facs="P56_TL00077"/>with tapestries copied from the originals,<lb facs="P56_TL00078"/>etc, etc." &amp;<lb facs="P56_TL00079"/>&amp; Neither of these gentlemen solves the rid*<lb facs="P56_TL00080"/>die.

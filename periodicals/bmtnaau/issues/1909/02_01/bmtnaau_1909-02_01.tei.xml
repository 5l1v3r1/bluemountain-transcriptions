And what guarantee has the<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>National Theatre that it is going to secure the best English talent and prevent the theatres<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>of private enterprise from doing so ? jz? &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>&amp; These are the questions which committees cannot decide, and therefore the position of<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>the National Theatre is very insecure. If the Committee would send abroad, to Germany,<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>to Russia, to France, and make enquiries in the right places,... that is to say, if they would<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>enquire of those people not employed to bolster up these national frauds, they would find<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>out that the finest talent in Europe is outside the National Theatre in each country. &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>&amp; Now there are many people on the English Committee who know this, and they are<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>distinctly dishonest if they do not put this fact before the others. &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>We have spoken of National Theatres as being frauds, but there is no reason why the<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>English National Theatre should court so undesirable a reputation.

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00004"/>florid theatre, a theatre of gorgeous spectacle for which Shakespeare is the excuse, and it<lb facs="P7_TL00005"/>could announce that it would request Mr Beerbohm Tree to shed the light of his spectacular<lb facs="P7_TL00006"/>talent in this direction. Or it could announce that it is going to be a trite and somewhat<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>pedantic theatre, and it could announce that it has requested Mr Poel to bring to it this<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>atmosphere. Or it could announce that it is going to be a theatre of experiment in art and<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>socialism, and that it is going to ask Mr Granville Barker, Mr William Archer and Mr<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>Bernard Shaw to try their hands upon it. Or it could announce that the spirit of this<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>theatre is to be that inaugurated by Messrs Pinero and Jones in the Eighties. Any of these<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>programmes are, we suppose, strong and pure enough to receive support. But if it makes no<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>announcement as to its artistic programme, no one interested in the art will know what it<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>is they are asked to support. If, on the other hand, all these things are going to be mixed<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>together, we shall know quite well that we cannot support it at all.<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>&amp; The National Theatres abroad have no artistic programmes whatever. The auditoriums of<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>the theatres are generally very dangerous places full of twisting passages and long staircases.,.,<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>deathtraps in the event of fire; yet these theatres serve the excellent purpose of a good<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>show room for pretty dresses and the surplus wealth of the upper classes. &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>&lt;£? Still there is no need for this in London, for we already have many such theatres. We have<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>Covent Garden Theatre, Drury Lane Theatre, His Majesty's Theatre; we have the "Alhambra"<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>we have the " Empire " and we have the " Paiace. "(1) JZ? &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>These six theatres are all handsome and spacious buildings such as are seldom met with<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>abroad, unless we go to the Scala in Milan or to some of the theatres in North and South<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>America; and yet, in spite of not possessing such vast theatres as we do in London, the<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>drama and the stage in Germany and Russia is in a far better condition. The truth is that<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>a National Theatre is not wanted in England. Perhaps even a Municipal Theatre is not<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>needed, but if there is a question as to which of the two is more desirable, the Municipal is,<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>without question, the theatre to support. It was this theatre which Sir Henry Irving<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>spoke up for in the latter years of his life. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>If the works of Shakespeare are looked upon as means of quickening the patriotism of<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>the English nation, then a Municipal Theatre is again, for this reason, the only one to<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>support. But it would be a cruel thing to go round the country to Manchester, to Liverpool,<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>to Birmingham, to Bristol and the other cities, taking money from those towns in order to<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>erect a gilded box of a place in London, so that London may benefit and the other cities<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>go hang. Perhaps it is that London needs reminding of its patriotism more than these other<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>cities; but were we the Mayor and Corporation of the cities above mentioned we should<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>most earnestly recommend our citizens to have nothing to do with supporting the theatre<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>of London, which London itself could not support. The idea is preposterous. &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>In Germany, when Munchen wants its State Theatre, Munchen alone pays for that theatre.<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>In Dresden, if they want such a theatre that town pays for it. In Berlin it is the same, and<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>so with all the great cities in Europe. It is only in London, the richest city in the world,<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>that they send round the hat to the poor provincial cousins, promising them a free pass at</ab>

At that time the<lb facs="P15_TL00091"/>little silk shoes of your cousin Miranda were<lb facs="P15_TL00092"/>of more interest to you than the track of a<lb facs="P15_TL00093"/>stag on the forest's edge. It was more to you<lb facs="P15_TL00094"/>to touch her dress when you were playing<lb facs="P15_TL00095"/>ball than to have your forehead brushed by<lb facs="P15_TL00096"/>the damp rustling branches of the trees at a<lb facs="P15_TL00097"/>stag hunt. So you early robbed yourself of<lb facs="P15_TL00098"/>that which ought to have belonged to you<lb facs="P15_TL00099"/>later, and that which you missed then you<lb facs="P15_TL00100"/>will never be able to recover. What an<lb facs="P15_TL00101"/>obstinate thing youth is, like the cuckoo<lb facs="P15_TL00102"/>which throws out of other nests the eggs<lb facs="P15_TL00103"/>which belong in them in order to make a<lb facs="P15_TL00104"/>place for its own. There is something about<lb facs="P15_TL00105"/>you young people which can easily make one<lb facs="P15_TL00106"/>very impatient. You are like an actor who<lb facs="P15_TL00107"/>improvises and who does not pay attention<lb facs="P15_TL00108"/>to the cues: Later on all that will change.<lb facs="P15_TL00109"/>Everything that you have in your head is<lb facs="P15_TL00110"/>old-fashioned. Leave it alone, Fortunio. Do<lb facs="P15_TL00111"/>you want to come along now?<lb facs="P15_TL00112"/>&amp; FORTUNIO. &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00113"/>No, 1 would rather stay here,<lb facs="P15_TL00114"/>£&gt; THE GRANDMOTHER. &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00115"/>Then, come along with me, Sennor. I believe<lb facs="P15_TL00116"/>you will find that an old woman is less a<lb facs="P15_TL00117"/>bore than this young gentleman. I will tell<lb facs="P15_TL00118"/>you a story. What kind would you like to<lb facs="P15_TL00119"/>hear? A love story or a story of the chase?<lb facs="P15_TL00120"/>(Livio gives her his arm. They go away, the<lb facs="P15_TL00121"/>servant following).<lb facs="P15_TL00122"/>livio.<lb facs="P15_TL00123"/>Farewell, Fortunio.<lb facs="P15_TL00124"/>FORTUNIO. &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00125"/>Good night.<lb facs="P15_TL00126"/>(They disappear behind the trees to the right)<lb facs="P15_TL00127"/>(To be continued)</ab>

But already the hands of the sun on the heavenly dial are pointing to the hour at which<lb facs="P16_TL00006"/>all .good Christians should drink wine. The scene is changed and, transported as by miracle,<lb facs="P16_TL00007"/>the spectators find themselves at the " Garter Inn " famous for its lively girls, easy credit<lb facs="P16_TL00008"/>and sack. Of the host himself most improbable tales go about in the land of tipsters. He is<lb facs="P16_TL00009"/>said to be so hospitable that his winecellar for 4&lt; The blessed who thirst " stands open, whereas<lb facs="P16_TL00010"/>the garden gate, for those who are desirious of escaping by stealth, is always kept closed.<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>Something is also whispered of the miracles that take place in this good hostel. Once<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>it was seen how a tapster changed wine into water, diluting it in a mystic way—another<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>time it was remarked that master innkeeper could with one stroke of the chalk double<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>the number of empty tumblers. But who believes in such miracles in our times—consequently<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>the " Garter Inn " is always brimming with life, and the red noses and august stomachs<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>of its customers are the best evidences of the miraculous effects of the host's healing cordials.<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>Hallo! is there a kermess, worthy host, that there is such a swarm today in your tavern?<lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>—But it is true, we must not forget that, in the calender of these distinguished cavaliers<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>there are as many highways as there are days in the year—and drinking days, lightly<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>counting, at least twice as many. Let us enter, gentlemen—l suppose we shall find a worthy<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>company here—and then good host, be so kind as to make us acquainted with them,<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>recommending us as not of the worst winebibbers. &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>Here seated on the royal chair is " rex bibendi " Sir John Falstaff, having graced his<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>head with stag's antlers. In his hand he has taken the heavy tankard which he is accustomed<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>to empty at one draught. At his side stand Masters Nym, Pistol and Bardolph, simulating,<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>with clenched fists, the trumpets of the heralds. " Silence! le roi boit! " and when doctors<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>skilled in the science of drink declared that not a drop remained at the bottoms of the<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>glasses, when the cheeks of the gracious lord had become bloated, his nose violet, his eyes<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>filled with tears and his hair began to smoke, there was a cry of: Vivat! and in the same<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>moment a salvo was sent off, not from mortars but from broken tumblers. &lt;£? &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>And now his highness, as is his custom, will begin to tell stories, very curious, and to<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>which you must give creed, for they are very gay, and very peppery, He will relate of how<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>he had drunk with princes, of how, for him the Windsor ladies had scratched out each<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>others eyes, and of how the sylphs had pinched his calves, on a certain moonlight night in<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>Windsor Forest. But look at that loon who has fallen from the bench and is snoring,<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>indifferent even to the rude tales. That is Christopher Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>birth a pedlar, by education a card-maker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present<lb facs="P16_TL00038"/>profession a " tinker " a frequenter of " Marian Haeket the fatale wife of Windsor " and who,<lb facs="P16_TL00039"/>having lost credit with her has taken shelter under the friendly thatch of the " Garter Inn. "<lb facs="P16_TL00040"/>And who is that saucy fellow who makes so bold as to pat the king himself on his most<lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>serene stomach, and in presence of his monarchal nonsense, to boast of his own adventures.<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>That is " Miles Gloriosus " Monsieur Parolles mentor to Bertram, Count of Rousillon. Look<lb facs="P16_TL00043"/>how he puffs himself up relating about that famous expedition in search of the lost drum,<lb facs="P16_TL00044"/>and of how cunningly he extricated himself from oppression, when caught by the soldiers<lb facs="P16_TL00045"/>of the Muskos' regiment. This good-for-nothing threw up the courtier's life and set off<lb facs="P16_TL00046"/>roving, thinking to himself that " there's place and means for every man alive " and as all<lb facs="P16_TL00047"/>roads lead to the inn, took up his lodgings at this asylum for vagabonds. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00048"/>Now glance at this merry trio composed of Sir Toby Belch, Sir Andrew Aguecheek and the fool.<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>Look, the equally intrepid knight as mannerly gallant, Sir Andrew, has jumped on the<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>table and excels himself in a galliard, in the dancing of which he is famed in all Illyria.<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>Look how he kicks about with his thin shanks—the whole table is shaking with laughter.<lb facs="P16_TL00052"/>&amp; This well chosen company has fled from the puritanism infested palace of Olivia, and has<lb facs="P16_TL00053"/>pitched its tents here, finding every night that " tis too late to go to bed " for it was utterly<lb facs="P16_TL00054"/>impossible to live among people so conceited as was Malvolio who thought that " because<lb facs="P16_TL00055"/>he was virtuous there shall be no more cakes and ale. "<lb facs="P16_TL00056"/>Ah! here is also Autolycus, excourtier of the Bohemian Prince, Florizel,... a casual pickpocket...<lb facs="P16_TL00057"/>see how cleverly he simulates a pedfer.

Such a world-rover<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>as the world has never seen. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>JZ? He has been everything by turns.

They wanted to teach him to write and read, but his royal highness would<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>not for all the world agree to such a thing, and in a fury dashed to pieces the head of<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>the Magister who had dared to do such a dishonour to his majesty. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>&amp; After this celebrated deed the unfortunate Prince Royal fled before the clubs of the<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>servants of justice, and thanks to his heroism became a beggar.

The tricked out ladies-in-waiting move<lb facs="P20_TL00030"/>about the conspirating courtiers, informing the king of everything. The red headsman has<lb facs="P20_TL00031"/>folded his arms on his breast and awaits a sign from the king.

Your mirth<lb facs="P22_TL00026"/>equalled your sadness when looking on these cowards, boasters, and on ludicrous and<lb facs="P22_TL00027"/>unhappy lovers; for every MAN appearing in this TRAGICOMEDY OF MAN, whether<lb facs="P22_TL00028"/>appalling or amusing you, must have awakened in your HUMAN BREASTS: <lb facs="P22_TL00029"/>I have drawn tones from every key, have mixed colours from all palettes.... so as to<lb facs="P22_TL00030"/>create a man.<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>He appeared to you more grotesque, more ridiculous, more terrible than his photograph<lb facs="P22_TL00032"/>In naturalistic drama. He appeared to you less elegant, less virtuous, and less elegantly<lb facs="P22_TL00033"/>vicious, than his optimistic caricature in pseudo-classical &lt;£? &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00034"/>You have seen that every heroic deed has its comic side, and vice versa; you have<lb facs="P22_TL00035"/>learned to descry in, apparently, the most absolute baseness, certain elements of Beauty<lb facs="P22_TL00036"/>and vice versa; you have recognised that in this world, good and bad are equal powers,<lb facs="P22_TL00037"/>which are governed by DESTINY. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00038"/>You have perceived, in fine, that behind the back of each man without exception, stand<lb facs="P22_TL00039"/>my two subordinate spirits: Ariel and Caliban. jg? &lt;£? &lt;£? &lt;£?<lb facs="P22_TL00040"/>I have given you a foretaste of the existence of " more things in heaven and earth....<lb facs="P22_TL00041"/>than are dreamt of in your philosophy. "<lb facs="P22_TL00042"/>I have shown you the mystical union of man and spirits, and the mysterious germs of<lb facs="P22_TL00043"/>human actions. jz? &amp; .£?&lt;£? jz?<lb facs="P22_TL00044"/>I have given you proofs that the rainbow flourishes after a storm, and that, over the<lb facs="P22_TL00045"/>graves of those sleeping the everlasting sleep, lilies grow and larks &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00046"/>And all that I have shown you " held, as 'twere the mirror up to nature; showed virtue<lb facs="P22_TL00047"/>her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form<lb facs="P22_TL00048"/>and pressure. " jz? jg? jg?<lb facs="P22_TL00049"/>jz? You would certainly not be creators.... and creation is the duty of every man who is<lb facs="P22_TL00050"/>aware of the existence of his soul.... you would not, I repeat, be creators, but Athenian<lb facs="P22_TL00051"/>artisans of Mr. Bottom's company, deprived of imagination, if in every day life you will<lb facs="P22_TL00052"/>not have descried those fantastic colours with which my drama burned. <lb facs="P22_TL00053"/>It seems to me however that this pell»mell and apparent disorder render more exactly<lb facs="P22_TL00054"/>real life under fantastic forms than the moral drama the most minutely studied. Each man<lb facs="P22_TL00055"/>contains in himself the entire humanity; and, writing what comes into his head, he meets<lb facs="P22_TL00056"/>with greater success than in copying with a magnifying glass objects placed outside of him.

                                    <lb facs="P23_TL00003"/>&amp; I am sometimes astonished at youthful poetasters* complaints of reality, which clips<lb facs="P23_TL00004"/>their wings. What kind of reality do they see? The same with which those Athenians live,<lb facs="P23_TL00005"/>that, which is the rotten fruit of their boorish philosophy. Hence are derived the invented<lb facs="P23_TL00006"/>stuff, and nonsense about Utopia, in which such malcontents, from that seeming grey reality<lb facs="P23_TL00007"/>might find a refuge, but which they never do find. 4&gt; 4? 4?<lb facs="P23_TL00008"/>4? How unheavenward must be the flight of those over-poetised ganders, how unswanlike!<lb facs="P23_TL00009"/>the dirty hands of the first-coming Athenian churl may reach their wings. But we. gentlemen,<lb facs="P23_TL00010"/>who by the grace of God have the wings of cherubims, we know that reality is something<lb facs="P23_TL00011"/>utterly different from the distorted picture reflected in the cheap greenish looking-glass of<lb facs="P23_TL00012"/>the rustic consciousness of the Athenian man. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00013"/>4/ We know that reality depends on ourselves only, that we are its creatures always, and<lb facs="P23_TL00014"/>that we see it such as our CREATIVE WILL desires to see it. For that reason we do not<lb facs="P23_TL00015"/>know the boundery line between fable and truth, between dreaming and waking, and for<lb facs="P23_TL00016"/>that reason let us not flee from this reality for it is situated within us; each apparition,<lb facs="P23_TL00017"/>apparently for the ages of others, placed beyond us, is the effect of the emanation of that<lb facs="P23_TL00018"/>cluster of rays which fills our souls with a mystic light. »€? 4? 4? 4?<lb facs="P23_TL00019"/>For that reason I earnestly beg you not to try to range m;y drama under any category<lb facs="P23_TL00020"/>whatsoever. Leave that to literary historians, who would not fall asleep quietly, if, having<lb facs="P23_TL00021"/>met on their way with something singular, they did not baptise it with one of the names<lb facs="P23_TL00022"/>of their more than modest calendar. 4/ 4? 4?<lb facs="P23_TL00023"/>4? Do not call my theatre either classic or romantic or naturalistic. &amp; 4?<lb facs="P23_TL00024"/>You have seen that all these beautiful movements are contained in it without a remainder.<lb facs="P23_TL00025"/>4* Do not call it idealistic or realistic, since these words are devoid of sense for us, the<lb facs="P23_TL00026"/>creators of reality. j&amp;4? &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00027"/>4?

                                    <lb facs="P24_TL00004"/>Mr E. F. Spence has written lately in the Westminster Gazette on Tolerance in Dramatic<lb facs="P24_TL00005"/>Criticism. It is hardly a subject which we should expect Mr William Archer to be able<lb facs="P24_TL00006"/>to handle, or even Mr Max Beerbohm. Mr Walkley....? we 11....! But Mr Spence is of all the<lb facs="P24_TL00007"/>critics the most tolerant and the most generous and what he says is really most important.<lb facs="P24_TL00008"/>1 shall therefore reprint rather a long passage from it, believing that by so doing I am<lb facs="P24_TL00009"/>serving the very best interests of the most spirited movement of the theatre in England.<lb facs="P24_TL00010"/>&amp; 44 Some remarks lately appearing in a popular weekly paper concerning Mrs. Patrick<lb facs="P24_TL00011"/>44 Campbell's 44 Deirdre " and 44 Electra " deserve a little consideration. One of the critics<lb facs="P24_TL00012"/>44 attached to the paper spoke of the affair as being an 44 indifferent performance of indifferent<lb facs="P24_TL00013"/>44 tragedies," and then said it was 44 a simple affectation to profess to enjoy it," and that it<lb facs="P24_TL00014"/>44 was not, 44 as some people seem to think, a mark of culture, but only of insufficient culture<lb facs="P24_TL00015"/>44 not to acknowledge that one is bored by this kind of thing." An affronted critic wrote<lb facs="P24_TL00016"/>14 to the paper, complaining of the charge of affectation and insufficient culture, and was<lb facs="P24_TL00017"/>44 promptly rebuked as 44 a bumptious correspondent, and told that his letter convinced the<lb facs="P24_TL00018"/>44 critic that he was one of those affected persons whose misdirected zeal the writer deplored.<lb facs="P24_TL00019"/>44 This attitude is not a novelty. Most of the critics, when 1 was a boy, charged the professed<lb facs="P24_TL00020"/>44 admirers of Wagner with being impostors or imbeciles; later on, anyone who professed<lb facs="P24_TL00021"/>44 to like the pictures of Whistler or Rossetti or Burne-Jones, or any of the Impressionists,<lb facs="P24_TL00022"/>44 was accused of affectation. When Ibsen was introduced to England the conservative<lb facs="P24_TL00023"/>44 critics raved, and alleged that the Ibsenites (or Obscenites—the word was considered very<lb facs="P24_TL00024"/>44 witty) were humbugs; this was the least offensive of their charges. The same kind of<lb facs="P24_TL00025"/>44 thing happened in the case of Maeterlink. One might cite many other instances. &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00026"/>44 It is a curious form of attack. Why should I, who had much pleasure and certainly<lb facs="P24_TL00027"/>44 no boredom, if a shade of disappointment, from Mr. Yeats's play and Mrs. Campbell's<lb facs="P24_TL00028"/>44 beautiful acting, be charged with affectation because I said so, and also with insufficient<lb facs="P24_TL00029"/>44 culture? There is a certain amount of inconsistency in the charges which may be disregarded.<lb facs="P24_TL00030"/>44 Of course, I am insufficiently cultured. There are thousands of plays and books that I<lb facs="P24_TL00031"/>44 ought to have read, of dramas I ought to have witnessed, of pictures I ought to have<lb facs="P24_TL00032"/>44 seen, masses of music I ought to have heard—and have not—and, therefore, 1 am a person<lb facs="P24_TL00033"/>44 of very insufficient culture. But the writer in question should offer some evidence of his<lb facs="P24_TL00034"/>44 own sufficiency of culture before alleging that my opinion concerning the play and the<lb facs="P24_TL00035"/>44 performance is due to a lack of culture. After all, in a free country one would seem<lb facs="P24_TL00036"/>44 entitled to express an opinion on a question of art without being called a liar by someone<lb facs="P24_TL00037"/>44 who takes a different view. The matter is one of some importance, because the attack is<lb facs="P24_TL00038"/>44 insidious and dangerous. The deadliest weapon in the hands of the critic is the allegation<lb facs="P24_TL00039"/>44 of boredom. You may say that a piece is vulgar, indelicate, inartistic, indecent, full of<lb facs="P24_TL00040"/>44 44 chestnuts, " old-fashioned, 44 melodramatic, " violent, ill-constructed, or unoriginal<lb facs="P24_TL00041"/>44 without doing fatal injury, but if you allege that you and everybody else suffered from<lb facs="P24_TL00042"/>44 boredom your attack may be fatal. This, I think, is the reason why the charge is so often<lb facs="P24_TL00043"/>44 made by people with strong prejudices. &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00044"/>&amp; 44 There is something to be said on both sides. No doubt the lovers of the severer form of<lb facs="P24_TL00045"/>44 drama, the worshippers of Shaw, the body which has supported the societies of which the<lb facs="P24_TL00046"/>44 Independent Theatre was the first and has regarded the Court Theatre for a while as a<lb facs="P24_TL00047"/>44 kind of Mecca, are not always judicious when talking about musical comedy and comic opera,<lb facs="P24_TL00048"/>4 and some members of it have been very narrow-minded. They have refused to admit the<lb facs="P24_TL00049"/>merit of any comic operas, except those of Gilbert and Sullivan, they have lavished<lb facs="P24_TL00050"/>44 indiscriminating abuse upon almost all others, have looked upon Daly's Theatre and the<lb facs="P24_TL00051"/>44 Gaiety and the Prince of Wales' as so many Nazareths. This, of course, has caused a great<lb facs="P24_TL00052"/>44 deal of annoyance to the lovers of musico-dramatic work, some of whom have been quite<lb facs="P24_TL00053"/>44 indiscriminate in their loves. Moreover, some of the austere folk have denounced melodrama<lb facs="P24_TL00054"/>44 and the so-called romantic comedy, without drawing nice distinctions. This indiscriminate<lb facs="P24_TL00055"/>44 denunciation has naturally caused annoyance and reprisals. Still, a strong difference of<lb facs="P24_TL00056"/>44 attitude exists.

When<lb facs="P25_TL00007"/>44 an eminent member of the Bar told me that he had been three times to see 44 A Chinese<lb facs="P25_TL00008"/>Honeymoon," I did not charge him with affectation or insufficient culture, I merely put him,<lb facs="P25_TL00009"/>44 in my mind, into a particular interesting class. When a charming lady told me at dinner<lb facs="P25_TL00010"/>that she doted on 44 The Scarlet Pimpernel," and would like to go and see it every night,<lb facs="P25_TL00011"/>44 1 knew she was in earnest, and asked her to point out.her husband to me; he did look a<lb facs="P25_TL00012"/>44 little careworn. Without for one moment believing in the phrase 44 De gustibus non est<lb facs="P25_TL00013"/>44 dispulandum " as ordinarily interpreted, ! fully recognise that palates differ. If M. Steinheil<lb facs="P25_TL00014"/>44 chose to dine upon cold pork=pie, sausage, cold veal, and lobster, as the papers allege, I am<lb facs="P25_TL00015"/>44 not surprised that he died, only a little amazed that the French police are puzzled as to<lb facs="P25_TL00016"/>44 the cause of his death, but I see no reason for charging him with affectation in eating such<lb facs="P25_TL00017"/>44 a meal, or insufficient culture, though it was hardly the banquet of a gourmet. I have<lb facs="P25_TL00018"/>44 shuddered at a costly Bouillabaisse chez Roubillon at Marseilles without doubting that<lb facs="P25_TL00019"/>44 poor old 44 G. A. S." loved the dish. I prefer homely beer to any of the white wines of the<lb facs="P25_TL00020"/>44 Rhine; yet I believe that many people honestly enjoy those high=priced varieties of<lb facs="P25_TL00021"/>44 weak-minded vinegar, and am sure that it is not affectation that causes some people to<lb facs="P25_TL00022"/>44 profess to like black-pudding and tripe and onions. &amp;<lb facs="P25_TL00023"/>44 The matter has its serious aspect. The attacks made, very unfairly I think, upon the<lb facs="P25_TL00024"/>44 novel forms of drama by conservative critics, when they take this form of alleging that not<lb facs="P25_TL00025"/>44 only the critic but the audience was bored, and that professed admirers are insincere,<lb facs="P25_TL00026"/>44 undoubtedly are very effective, and certainly are sometimes made in good faith. There are<lb facs="P25_TL00027"/>44 people so foolish as to think that nobody can like what they do not; also so fatuous as to<lb facs="P25_TL00028"/>44 consider that no one ought to like what they do not: but to jump from this to alleging that<lb facs="P25_TL00029"/>44 the professed admirers of ambitious works are humbugs is outrageous. Ido not doubt that<lb facs="P25_TL00030"/>44 the butcher=»boy enjoys 44 Sweeney Todd, the Barber of Fleet=street." Why should he<lb facs="P25_TL00031"/>44 disbelieve the statement by me that I get pleasure from a performance of a 44 Hedda Gabler,"<lb facs="P25_TL00032"/>44 which would hardly appeal to him? In my belief large numbers of playgoers have been kept<lb facs="P25_TL00033"/>44 away from able and ambitious dramas, written by dramatists with a true artistic aim, because<lb facs="P25_TL00034"/>44 of the oft repeated allegations by newspaper writers who did not like them that everybodj'<lb facs="P25_TL00035"/>44 was bored; also, I think that the wholesale denunciation of the lighter forms of dramatic<lb facs="P25_TL00036"/>44 and musico-dramatic forms of entertainment by some of the critics has weakened their<lb facs="P25_TL00037"/>44 influence, has led the man in the street to think that if Mr. X or Y or Z can find no pleasure<lb facs="P25_TL00038"/>44 in what he likes that he will get no entertainment from what they admire. One supposes,<lb facs="P25_TL00039"/>44 at least hopes, that dramatic critics of all kinds and grades have an honest desire for the<lb facs="P25_TL00040"/>44 advance and success of British drama. They will hardly be successful in their„wishes unless<lb facs="P25_TL00041"/>4 on each side a little more tolerance is shown for the opinions professed by members of the<lb facs="P25_TL00042"/>44 other.<lb facs="P25_TL00043"/>That is the commencement of Mr Spence's article. The insufferable attitude which he<lb facs="P25_TL00044"/>objects to is peculiar to England alone. It seems to be the prerogative of a peculiarly<lb facs="P25_TL00045"/>eccentric clique in London to find in the work of young poets and young painters something<lb facs="P25_TL00046"/>which is vile and not to be endured.<lb facs="P25_TL00047"/>This clique positively hates beauty and the people who live to create beauty. It is<lb facs="P25_TL00048"/>composed of people who are intolerable and intolerant. They are a wretched and ignorant<lb facs="P25_TL00049"/>little set who go about calling themselves the majority, and, as Mr Spence says, they are<lb facs="P25_TL00050"/>dangerous because, like scandalmongers, they go about whispering that every one is bored<lb facs="P25_TL00051"/>by Beauty.<lb facs="P25_TL00052"/>1 think Mr Spence is far too good when he tries to set the example of tolerance for the<lb facs="P25_TL00053"/>sake of these wretches. I think his tolerance does them too much honour. They care not<lb facs="P25_TL00054"/>a scrap for the mild and courteous remonstrance for their skin is thick and their<lb facs="P25_TL00055"/>conscience dull.<lb facs="P25_TL00056"/>But there is something we must not forget. This little clique here spoken of is always<lb facs="P25_TL00057"/>boasting that it is the public, (as if that could stand as an excuse for its sterility) and has<lb facs="P25_TL00058"/>succeeded in coining so many phrases for the occupants of the stalls and the pit to make<lb facs="P25_TL00059"/>use of, that evefi today we find really nice people with the best will in the world talking<lb facs="P25_TL00060"/>utter nonsense at the theatre.

In<lb facs="P26_TL00004"/>other lands the theatre public is a most intelligent body off people, intensely serious and<lb facs="P26_TL00005"/>not afraid of being so: intensely fond of these very plays, " Deirdre " and "Electra," by<lb facs="P26_TL00006"/>these very poets, Yeats and Hofmannsthal, about whom these imbeciles in the London stalls<lb facs="P26_TL00007"/>choose to be impertinent. What right has any man or woman in the London stalls to<lb facs="P26_TL00008"/>have anything to say about the work off Mr Yeats or Mr Hofmannsthal? I can bring<lb facs="P26_TL00009"/>countless reasons to show that these creatures should remain entirely silent before two<lb facs="P26_TL00010"/>such beautiful works, and give proof beyond measure why public and critics alike should<lb facs="P26_TL00011"/>remain silent.... yes, entirely silent.... when in the presence off a masterpiece, (i) If such an<lb facs="P26_TL00012"/>ignoramus should proffer me his opinion that the works in question are not masterpieces<lb facs="P26_TL00013"/>he will be unable to say why or to defend his assertion, whereas I shall be able to afford<lb facs="P26_TL00014"/>him convincing proof as to the truth of mine.

Artists are perhaps the most generous people<lb facs="P27_TL00010"/>on the round globe and their trials today are far sterner than they were formerly, for they<lb facs="P27_TL00011"/>are not only witnesses of the theft and ruination of their ideas, they are doomed to stand<lb facs="P27_TL00012"/>by while the people hysterically applaud the transformation of good to bad, and to listen<lb facs="P27_TL00013"/>to the cries of the hawkers who are announcing " all the latest improvements ". &amp;<lb facs="P27_TL00014"/>All the conferences in the world on the question of International Copyright are not going<lb facs="P27_TL00015"/>to alter this, and the only question which remains to be answered is, Is this a sign of the<lb facs="P27_TL00016"/>natural death of the Arts? It is folly for Nature to contend against dissolution, and if<lb facs="P27_TL00017"/>the Arts are dying, then why waste any more time over them? A quick and tidy death is<lb facs="P27_TL00018"/>far more desirable than a protracted one.<lb facs="P27_TL00019"/>Perhaps the winds from America which are assisting in this destruction—which I, as an<lb facs="P27_TL00020"/>artist, must look on as the utmost folly of all follies—perhaps this wind bringing on its<lb facs="P27_TL00021"/>currents the wonders of electricity and the marvels of aviation, perhaps this wind will blow<lb facs="P27_TL00022"/>good stuff around the world. Perhaps it is really time to put away childish things such as<lb facs="P27_TL00023"/>music, poetry and the rest; or, to put it differently, perhaps it is time for the artists<lb facs="P27_TL00024"/>gracefully to retire from the field. There is such a thing as over=staying one's welcome.<lb facs="P27_TL00025"/>&amp; To those who wish to be rid of us, those last words on the doorstep are really<lb facs="P27_TL00026"/>rathef a bore, although to the departing guest who wishes to stay they are the pleasantest<lb facs="P27_TL00027"/>of all. &amp; Still, it would be far more tasteful of the artists to retire before the hour is too late<lb facs="P27_TL00028"/>and before everyone is yawning. Perhaps a little ceremony to mark the moment would<lb facs="P27_TL00029"/>be a graceful act on the part of the world; a little conference perhaps on that; perhaps<lb facs="P27_TL00030"/>a few speeches of thanks to the artists for their labours, more especially for the<lb facs="P27_TL00031"/>labours of their forefathers whose works have supported so very many wealthy families<lb facs="P27_TL00032"/>for many centuries and still continue to be the pride (?) of the centres of Europe.<lb facs="P27_TL00033"/>And there are reasons why the artist should retire once and for all. He does not<lb facs="P27_TL00034"/>usually like posing, although today it is the general belief that every artist is a poseur,<lb facs="P27_TL00035"/>and so this enforced position of his today of lying posed upon the rack is thoroughly distasteful<lb facs="P27_TL00036"/>to him. There is too much talk about the " will to endure " today. That is almost as gross<lb facs="P27_TL00037"/>as its opposite: it has become with nearly threefourths of the people today a pose which<lb facs="P27_TL00038"/>they are forced to accept through necessity. Not that I mean " necessity " in the trifling<lb facs="P27_TL00039"/>matter of bread and butter. I mean the need of the nourishment of their ancient pride and<lb facs="P27_TL00040"/>nobility. It is this need and this starvation which fill Trafalgar Square today, and which<lb facs="P27_TL00041"/>bring out five thousand policemen to prevent twenty women entering Parliament, and<lb facs="P27_TL00042"/>which will in time breed some strange and terrible resistance among those who practise<lb facs="P27_TL00043"/>the arts, unless, as I have suggested, they retire freely. By doing so they would thus save<lb facs="P27_TL00044"/>the face of those for whom they have continually laboured,... their children, the vulgar<lb facs="P27_TL00045"/>people. For the earth is made up of two classes only: artists and the vulgar: there is no<lb facs="P27_TL00046"/>other distinction between people than this.<lb facs="P27_TL00047"/>The vulgar have got the upper hand so it is best that the artist should retire. Then there will<lb facs="P27_TL00048"/>be no further need for these farces which are called " Conferences" to decide matters<lb facs="P27_TL00049"/>relating to International Copyright.

Nevertheless, 110 thoughtful person can deny that<lb facs="P27_TL00058"/>" in a court of morals the theft of an idea, which has been so far realised as to become the<lb facs="P27_TL00059"/>" subject of property, is quite as dishonourable as the theft of a gold watch and chain<lb facs="P27_TL00060"/>&amp; Mr Spence indicates that a conference on morality would be more profitable: he suggests</ab>

It is all a matter of the point of view.<lb facs="P28_TL00030"/>When the acting is poor an enthusiastic roaring and thundering audience are necessary to<lb facs="P28_TL00031"/>keep up the spirits; but when the acting is absorbing, applause is not needed.... and if the<lb facs="P28_TL00032"/>actor wont come and bow, or the curtain rise after it has once fallen,... well then, applause<lb facs="P28_TL00033"/>becomes futile. &amp;<lb facs="P28_TL00034"/>Reader: Who ever heard of such an idea? &amp;<lb facs="P28_TL00035"/>Writer: My dear reader, it is not an idea, it is an established fact. Remove the reason<lb facs="P28_TL00036"/>for applause and you prevent the applause itself, and in doing so prevent a vulgarity.<lb facs="P28_TL00037"/>&amp; Reader: But it is tSie natural desire to want to applaud when you see something good.<lb facs="P28_TL00038"/>Writer: Rather is it an unnatural habit. You do not applaud a thing, only a man or a<lb facs="P28_TL00039"/>woman. Applause is the flattery of the strong by the weak. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P28_TL00040"/>If the conductor and musicians of an orchestra were not seen we should never applaud<lb facs="P28_TL00041"/>music.

The air and the poems of the air leave us calm,... but the arioplanist we<lb facs="P28_TL00047"/>greet with enthusiasm.... we feel it is better for us to be friends with such a man.<lb facs="P28_TL00048"/>Applause is the gross expression of a fear awakened in the presence of a man in a<lb facs="P28_TL00049"/>stronger position than that held by ourselves. The sooner applause is banished from the<lb facs="P28_TL00050"/>theatre the better for actors and audience. The way partly to prevent it is to leave the<lb facs="P28_TL00051"/>curtain down at the end of each act and not raise it again till the beginning of the next act,<lb facs="P28_TL00052"/>and to give up the bad practice of the actor appearing before the curtain. &amp;<lb facs="P28_TL00053"/>&amp; Reader: But the audience want it, they want to see their favorites again and again.<lb facs="P28_TL00054"/>Writer: Then let there be a new kind of Zoo, with men and women on view in the cages.</ab>

All dramatic motifs will come under<lb facs="P29_TL00011"/>one of these heads, and the greatest Dramas<lb facs="P29_TL00012"/>to some extent deal with them all, though<lb facs="P29_TL00013"/>it will generally be found that one or other<lb facs="P29_TL00014"/>of them has supplied the leading theme. The<lb facs="P29_TL00015"/>tragedy of Hamlet for instance, is that of<lb facs="P29_TL00016"/>his own personality, which his egotism, pushed<lb facs="P29_TL00017"/>to insanity, identifies with the Infinite; his<lb facs="P29_TL00018"/>relations with others, with his father's spirit<lb facs="P29_TL00019"/>or with Ophelia, serve merely as foils or<lb facs="P29_TL00020"/>illustrations to that main idea.<lb facs="P29_TL00021"/>The great dramatists, being not only poets<lb facs="P29_TL00022"/>and philosophers but also great artists, their<lb facs="P29_TL00023"/>subsidiary motifs are apt to be treated with<lb facs="P29_TL00024"/>such patient craft and wealth of detail that it<lb facs="P29_TL00025"/>is not always very easy to determine the<lb facs="P29_TL00026"/>fundamental theme of the drama. Especially<lb facs="P29_TL00027"/>is this the case with Faust. The skill with<lb facs="P29_TL00028"/>which the subordinate characters are drawn,<lb facs="P29_TL00029"/>the precision and richness of the secondary<lb facs="P29_TL00030"/>events in the action, not to speak of the<lb facs="P29_TL00031"/>intricate symbolism of the Second Part, serve<lb facs="P29_TL00032"/>as much to veil as to indicate the main idea.<lb facs="P29_TL00033"/>The popular imagination has naturally seized<lb facs="P29_TL00034"/>on the romance of Faust and Gretchen as<lb facs="P29_TL00035"/>the principal theme of the poem. The 44 heart"<lb facs="P29_TL00036"/>is easily moved by the tears of maidens who<lb facs="P29_TL00037"/>love more well than wisely, and seduction<lb facs="P29_TL00038"/>must inevitably appear to those many people<lb facs="P29_TL00039"/>who are constitutionally unable to raise their<lb facs="P29_TL00040"/>psychic lives out of the soft valleys of sense<lb facs="P29_TL00041"/>and emotion, as the one supremely tragic<lb facs="P29_TL00042"/>climax of experience. To such as these<lb facs="P29_TL00043"/>44 Faust " under the title of 44 The Woes of<lb facs="P29_TL00044"/>Gretchen " is nothing but a pendant to the<lb facs="P29_TL00045"/>44 Sorrows of Werther. " The Management of<lb facs="P29_TL00046"/>44 His Majesty's " whose primary duty is to<lb facs="P29_TL00047"/>entertain the public, very properly takes this<lb facs="P29_TL00048"/>view and Messrs Stephen Phillips and Comyns<lb facs="P29_TL00049"/>Carr have 44 freely adapted " and cut the poem<lb facs="P29_TL00050"/>to suit it. These gentlemen seem to call for<lb facs="P29_TL00051"/>neither praise nor blame. Since it had to be<lb facs="P29_TL00052"/>done, I daresay they have done it as well as<lb facs="P29_TL00053"/>was possible.

"<lb facs="P29_TL00074"/>To any such devout enquirers into Goethe's<lb facs="P29_TL00075"/>meaning I would suggest that there is another<lb facs="P29_TL00076"/>and a deeper interpretation. &amp; ug?<lb facs="P29_TL00077"/>The conflict between pure thought and<lb facs="P29_TL00078"/>experience forces itself very soon upon the<lb facs="P29_TL00079"/>attention of the student of philosophy. It<lb facs="P29_TL00080"/>presents itself in various forms. Hegel's<lb facs="P29_TL00081"/>Absolute Idea eternally realized in full<lb facs="P29_TL00082"/>perfection as it demonstrably must be, in the<lb facs="P29_TL00083"/>World, jars hopelessly with the circumstances<lb facs="P29_TL00084"/>of the destruction of Messina or indeed with<lb facs="P29_TL00085"/>the fact of five minutes of toothache. If<lb facs="P29_TL00086"/>44 Reality " is placed in that which can without<lb facs="P29_TL00087"/>logical contradiction be formulated as such,<lb facs="P29_TL00088"/>then experience leaping exultantly from one<lb facs="P29_TL00089"/>shattered category of thought to another<lb facs="P29_TL00090"/>is evidently 44 unreal. " On the other hand<lb facs="P29_TL00091"/>experience is given us and without it we<lb facs="P29_TL00092"/>should not know ourselves at all, much less<lb facs="P29_TL00093"/>as the 44 spirit " of Hegelian philosophers.<lb facs="P29_TL00094"/>Here is a hopeless impasse. 44 What must be<lb facs="P29_TL00095"/>is " says the metaphysician withlogical truth;<lb facs="P29_TL00096"/>but the premisses of that perfectly correct<lb facs="P29_TL00097"/>deduction cannot throw even the faintest<lb facs="P29_TL00098"/>gleam of light on what will be. Experience<lb facs="P29_TL00099"/>goes its reckless way careless of the conditions<lb facs="P29_TL00100"/>which from motives of the highest rationality<lb facs="P29_TL00101"/>we wish to impose on it; it can only be<lb facs="P29_TL00102"/>conquered on its own terms. Those who will<lb facs="P29_TL00103"/>not accept them are sterilized, they have<lb facs="P29_TL00104"/>denied an instinct deeper than the instinct of<lb facs="P29_TL00105"/>knowledge, they have denied the instinct of<lb facs="P29_TL00106"/>life. This negation was always to Goethe the<lb facs="P29_TL00107"/>one sin against the Holy Ghost. Faust, in the<lb facs="P29_TL00108"/>first scene, is represented at the close of a<lb facs="P29_TL00109"/>long life passed in the accumulation ofjabstract<lb facs="P29_TL00110"/>knowledge, with his hands empty, his nature<lb facs="P29_TL00111"/>starved. So intolerable is his boredom that<lb facs="P29_TL00112"/>he sees no escape but suicide. He is checked<lb facs="P29_TL00113"/>in this purpose by the accidental revival of<lb facs="P29_TL00114"/>the religious mood which dissolves him in<lb facs="P29_TL00115"/>sentimental memories of his childhood. But<lb facs="P29_TL00116"/>the religious mood is bound up with the<lb facs="P29_TL00117"/>assertion of the manifestly incredible dogma<lb facs="P29_TL00118"/>of Christ's resurrection. His learning has at<lb facs="P29_TL00119"/>least convinced him of the impossibility of<lb facs="P29_TL00120"/>such a solution of the world's mystery as<lb facs="P29_TL00121"/>that. Then he walks abroad with Wagner the<lb facs="P29_TL00122"/>simple-minded enthusiast of knowledge, and<lb facs="P29_TL00123"/>the respect which his disciple and his fellow<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

For the Devil is the force which<lb facs="P30_TL00016"/>attempts evil but can only achieve good.

" The kind of work which<lb facs="P31_TL00008"/>this theatre is built to enshrine is, according<lb facs="P31_TL00009"/>to Mr Richard Watson Gilder, the poetical<lb facs="P31_TL00010"/>works of Shakespeare until something better<lb facs="P31_TL00011"/>can be found, and that Shakespeare is going<lb facs="P31_TL00012"/>to be put on in the most lavish way may be<lb facs="P31_TL00013"/>gathered from the lavish way in which the<lb facs="P31_TL00014"/>corner stone was laid. <lb facs="P31_TL00015"/>Many beautiful rose trees were stripped of<lb facs="P31_TL00016"/>their blossoms so that a bower might be<lb facs="P31_TL00017"/>formed for Mr. Vanderbilt, Mr. Gilder, Mr<lb facs="P31_TL00018"/>Thomas, Mr Finley, Mayor Mclellan and Miss<lb facs="P31_TL00019"/>Geraldine Farrar.<lb facs="P31_TL00020"/>What a thoughtless way to commence anything<lb facs="P31_TL00021"/>new! Could not the art of any man in America<lb facs="P31_TL00022"/>devise a canopy which should be worthy<lb facs="P31_TL00023"/>enough without having resource to nature<lb facs="P31_TL00024"/>pure and simple and without the massacre<lb facs="P31_TL00025"/>of many beautiful flowers, .... those flowers<lb facs="P31_TL00026"/>which the Emperor Huensung of the Tang<lb facs="P31_TL00027"/>Dynasty loved so much that he hung tiny<lb facs="P31_TL00028"/>golden bells on the branches of the trees to<lb facs="P31_TL00029"/>keep the birds from them... those flowers that<lb facs="P31_TL00030"/>he went often in the spring time with his<lb facs="P31_TL00031"/>court musicians to give pleasure to by playing<lb facs="P31_TL00032"/>the music of moderation ? &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00033"/>If the Society of the West chooses to choke<lb facs="P31_TL00034"/>its tables with a glut of cut flowers, surely<lb facs="P31_TL00035"/>the artists of the West can learn something<lb facs="P31_TL00036"/>from the artist of the East,... can learn from<lb facs="P31_TL00037"/>them the respect which is due to flowers ?<lb facs="P31_TL00038"/>How right is Okakura=&lt;Kakuzo when he writes<lb facs="P31_TL00039"/>about this matter: 44 Sad as it is, we cannot<lb facs="P31_TL00040"/>44 conceal the fact that in spite of our<lb facs="P31_TL00041"/>44 companionship with flowers we have not<lb facs="P31_TL00042"/>44 risen very far above the brute. Scratch the<lb facs="P31_TL00043"/>44 sheepskin and the wolf within us will soon<lb facs="P31_TL00044"/>44 show his teeth. It has been said that a man<lb facs="P31_TL00045"/>44 at ten is an animal, at twenty a lunatic, at<lb facs="P31_TL00046"/>44 thirty a failure, at forty a fraud, and at<lb facs="P31_TL00047"/>44 fifty a criminal. Perhaps he has become<lb facs="P31_TL00048"/>44 a criminal because he has never ceased to<lb facs="P31_TL00049"/>44 be an animal. Nothing is real to us but<lb facs="P31_TL00050"/>44 hunger, nothing sacred except our own<lb facs="P31_TL00051"/>44 desires. Shrine after shrine has crumbled<lb facs="P31_TL00052"/>44 before our eyes; but one altar forever is<lb facs="P31_TL00053"/>44 reserved, that whereon we burn incense to<lb facs="P31_TL00054"/>44 the supreme id 01,... ourselves.

" &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00062"/>And again, 44 The wanton waste of flowers<lb facs="P31_TL00063"/>44 among Western communities is even more<lb facs="P31_TL00064"/>14 appalling than the way they are treated<lb facs="P31_TL00065"/>44 by Eastern Flower Masters. The number of<lb facs="P31_TL00066"/>44 flowers cut daily to adorn the ballrooms<lb facs="P31_TL00067"/>44 and banquet=tables of Europe and America,<lb facs="P31_TL00068"/>44 to be thrown away on the morrow, must be<lb facs="P31_TL00069"/>46 something enormous; if strung together<lb facs="P31_TL00070"/>44 they might garland a continent. Beside this<lb facs="P31_TL00071"/>44 utter carelessness of life, the guilt of the<lb facs="P31_TL00072"/>44 Flower=Master becomes insignificant. He,<lb facs="P31_TL00073"/>44 at least, respects the economy of nature,<lb facs="P31_TL00074"/>44 selects his victims with careful foresight,<lb facs="P31_TL00075"/>44 and after death does honour to their remains<lb facs="P31_TL00076"/>44 In the West the display of flowers seems<lb facs="P31_TL00077"/>44 to be a part of the pageantry of wealth,...<lb facs="P31_TL00078"/>44 the fancy of a moment. Whither do they<lb facs="P31_TL00079"/>44 all go, these flowers, when the revelry is<lb facs="P31_TL00080"/>44 over? Nothing is more pitiful than to see a<lb facs="P31_TL00081"/>44 faded flower remorselessly flung upon a<lb facs="P31_TL00082"/>44 dung heap. " <lb facs="P31_TL00083"/>However, Miss Geraldine Farrar singing of the<lb facs="P31_TL00084"/>Star Spangled Banner must have been very<lb facs="P31_TL00085"/>inspiring.

                                       <lb facs="P33_TL00103"/>One of Mr Bernard Shaw's latest utterances<lb facs="P33_TL00104"/>convinces us that he is just beginning to<lb facs="P33_TL00105"/>perceive wherein lies the difference between<lb facs="P33_TL00106"/>an artist and a socialist, wherein lies the<lb facs="P33_TL00107"/>difference between beauty and ugliness, and<lb facs="P33_TL00108"/>wherein lies the difference between William<lb facs="P33_TL00109"/>Blake and Mr Bernard Shaw. &amp;<lb facs="P33_TL00110"/>We all know Blake's splendid lines from " A<lb facs="P33_TL00111"/>vision of the Last Judgment " in which he<lb facs="P33_TL00112"/>says " 1 assert, for myself, that 1 do not<lb facs="P33_TL00113"/>" behold the outward creation, and that to<lb facs="P33_TL00114"/>"me it is hindrance and not action. What<lb facs="P33_TL00115"/>"it will be questioned, when the sun rises,<lb facs="P33_TL00116"/>" do you not see a round disc of fire somewhat<lb facs="P33_TL00117"/>" like a guinea? Oh! no, no, 1 see an<lb facs="P33_TL00118"/>" innumerably company of the heavenly host<lb facs="P33_TL00119"/>" crying, " Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God</ab>

                                       <lb facs="P34_TL00002"/>" Almighty! " I question not my corporeal<lb facs="P34_TL00003"/>"eye any more than 1 would question a window<lb facs="P34_TL00004"/>44 concerning a sight. 1 look through it, and<lb facs="P34_TL00005"/>44 not with it. " &amp;<lb facs="P34_TL00006"/>Mr Bernard Shaw writes: 44 If you stand on<lb facs="P34_TL00007"/>44 Holborn Viaduct and take a snapshot of the<lb facs="P34_TL00008"/>44 things that are occurring, you have an<lb facs="P34_TL00009"/>" exact, superficial record; but you know<lb facs="P34_TL00010"/>44 nothing of Holborn Viaduct in any spiritual<lb facs="P34_TL00011"/>44 or truthful sense. If, on the other hand,<lb facs="P34_TL00012"/>44 another man, instead of saying,44 There are<lb facs="P34_TL00013"/>44 men and women walking up and down the<lb facs="P34_TL00014"/>44 street, " says 441 see a ladder stretched from<lb facs="P34_TL00015"/>44 earth to heaven, with angels ascending and<lb facs="P34_TL00016"/>44 descending, " you not only find that man<lb facs="P34_TL00017"/>44 much more interesting than the other, but<lb facs="P34_TL00018"/>44 I suggest that there would be genuine truth<lb facs="P34_TL00019"/>4* at the bottom of what he said, that there<lb facs="P34_TL00020"/>44 was some thing to be got out of it, that<lb facs="P34_TL00021"/>44 possibly he was a man able to make a<lb facs="P34_TL00022"/>44 revelation to you. " &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P34_TL00023"/>Now it seems to us, when we call to mind<lb facs="P34_TL00024"/>Mr Bernard Shaw's writings of many years<lb facs="P34_TL00025"/>that he has written in mockery against all<lb facs="P34_TL00026"/>that is beautiful: that is to say, all that is<lb facs="P34_TL00027"/>not actual, all that cannot be seen with the<lb facs="P34_TL00028"/>corporeal eye. Had he sincerely felt and seen<lb facs="P34_TL00029"/>with Blake, all this time we had been receiving<lb facs="P34_TL00030"/>poems instead of satires; for Mr Bernard<lb facs="P34_TL00031"/>Shaw, instead of seeing 44 men and women<lb facs="P34_TL00032"/>walking up and down the street " would<lb facs="P34_TL00033"/>have seen 44 a ladder stretched from earth to<lb facs="P34_TL00034"/>heaven, with angels ascending and descending,<lb facs="P34_TL00035"/>and we would have found 44 that man much<lb facs="P34_TL00036"/>more interesting than the other " and we are<lb facs="P34_TL00037"/>quite sure there would have been 44 genuine<lb facs="P34_TL00038"/>truth at the bottom of what he said " and<lb facs="P34_TL00039"/>that 44 possibly he was a man able to make<lb facs="P34_TL00040"/>a revelation" to us. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P34_TL00041"/>But Mr Shaw has always pointed out the<lb facs="P34_TL00042"/>street, and said it is a street and nothing but<lb facs="P34_TL00043"/>a street; that it is the ugliest street on the<lb facs="P34_TL00044"/>face of the earth; that there is only one thing<lb facs="P34_TL00045"/>to do and that is to sneer at it and to walk<lb facs="P34_TL00046"/>up and down it. And as he has looked upon<lb facs="P34_TL00047"/>the street with the corporeal eye so has he<lb facs="P34_TL00048"/>looked upon the sun with the corporeal eye,<lb facs="P34_TL00049"/>and in the same way has he looked upon the<lb facs="P34_TL00050"/>trees, the animals, the men and women of<lb facs="P34_TL00051"/>the suburb in which he has chosen to dwell.<lb facs="P34_TL00052"/>Now what makes Mr Shaw shift his whole<lb facs="P34_TL00053"/>ground in this manner? Has influence been<lb facs="P34_TL00054"/>brought to bear upon him? We fear it is too<lb facs="P34_TL00055"/>late. The old laws remain the same as they<lb facs="P34_TL00056"/>ever did and poets and artists are born, not<lb facs="P34_TL00057"/>influenced into being. &amp;<lb facs="P34_TL00058"/>Mr Shaw is the type of the self«made artist<lb facs="P34_TL00059"/>and there is no such thing as a genuine<lb facs="P34_TL00060"/>artist who has made himself; and yet self made<lb facs="P34_TL00061"/>artists abound all over the place. It is as<lb facs="P34_TL00062"/>much a profession today to be 44 an artist "<lb facs="P34_TL00063"/>as to be anything else. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P34_TL00064"/>Mr Shaw, like one of the characters in his<lb facs="P34_TL00065"/>own plays, has felt behind him that propelling<lb facs="P34_TL00066"/>power of moral purpose which has shot him<lb facs="P34_TL00067"/>from Dublin into London with the direct<lb facs="P34_TL00068"/>purpose of reforming London; and having<lb facs="P34_TL00069"/>given us a sermon,... a bitter sermon,... and</ab>

Our correspondant<lb facs="P34_TL00079"/>in New York points out in another column<lb facs="P34_TL00080"/>that the people of that town have protested<lb facs="P34_TL00081"/>against the whole traffic, so that the Mayor<lb facs="P34_TL00082"/>of New York closed five hundred and fifty<lb facs="P34_TL00083"/>of the places where such blasphemies are<lb facs="P34_TL00084"/>perpetrated.<lb facs="P34_TL00085"/>In the July, August and January numbers of<lb facs="P34_TL00086"/>The Mask we drew attention to the danger<lb facs="P34_TL00087"/>of permitting such exhibitions and we hope<lb facs="P34_TL00088"/>the authorities will act in the severest possible<lb facs="P34_TL00089"/>way and will not rest until they have passed<lb facs="P34_TL00090"/>a law, preventing horrors of any description<lb facs="P34_TL00091"/>leaking through to the public by this deadly<lb facs="P34_TL00092"/>process. Besides the unspeakable horror of<lb facs="P34_TL00093"/>these Religious Films there are other horrors<lb facs="P34_TL00094"/>which it would be good to prevent. Far too<lb facs="P34_TL00095"/>many murders and suicides are shown in<lb facs="P34_TL00096"/>this realistic manner. It conduces to murder<lb facs="P34_TL00097"/>and suicide.... if is in no way a prevention....<lb facs="P34_TL00098"/>scientists should be consulted on such matters<lb facs="P34_TL00099"/>if there be any doubt in the mind of the<lb facs="P34_TL00100"/>authorities. Some time ago picture posters<lb facs="P34_TL00101"/>depicting such horrors were banned in<lb facs="P34_TL00102"/>England. There must be some reason behind<lb facs="P34_TL00103"/>such a <lb facs="P34_TL00104"/>We hope this whole matter of the censorship<lb facs="P34_TL00105"/>of Cinemetograph Films will be carried through<lb facs="P34_TL00106"/>sternly and thoroughly.<lb facs="P34_TL00107"/>mm r William Archer has made a wonderful<lb facs="P34_TL00108"/>new 44 arrangement. " As announced in<lb facs="P34_TL00109"/>The Author it reads as follows:<lb facs="P34_TL00110"/>44 Mr William Archer has now made an<lb facs="P34_TL00111"/>44 arrangement with Messrs.

" &lt;£&gt;<lb facs="P34_TL00123"/>We think that this is about the last word<lb facs="P34_TL00124"/>that can be said in the matter of play writing.<lb facs="P34_TL00125"/>The idea of Mr William Archer seriously<lb facs="P34_TL00126"/>44 helping to save many a good idea from<lb facs="P34_TL00127"/>going wrong "... in fact, preventing a single<lb facs="P34_TL00128"/>dramatic egg from being addled, is stupendous;<lb facs="P34_TL00129"/>the picture of Mr Archer 44 nipping in the<lb facs="P34_TL00130"/>bud " some of the 44 hopeless plays on which<lb facs="P34_TL00131"/>authors might otherwise waste their time "<lb facs="P34_TL00132"/>is delicious.^<lb facs="P34_TL00133"/>How many beautiful flowers Mr Archer will<lb facs="P34_TL00134"/>destroy if he gets the chance!

He knows less about<lb facs="P35_TL00020"/>the creation of a play than these young<lb facs="P35_TL00021"/>authors whom he proposes to help. He has<lb facs="P35_TL00022"/>held authoritative positions on papers in<lb facs="P35_TL00023"/>England, and has done more damage to the<lb facs="P35_TL00024"/>English Theatre than any other man we can<lb facs="P35_TL00025"/>call to mind through tbe awful earnestness<lb facs="P35_TL00026"/>with which he regards himself and his mission,<lb facs="P35_TL00027"/>...an earnestness not tempered by a sense of<lb facs="P35_TL00028"/>beauty or humanity; through the self-conscious<lb facs="P35_TL00029"/>yet uninspired rapture in which he is never<lb facs="P35_TL00030"/>caught even napping; through the undisguised<lb facs="P35_TL00031"/>melancholy attitude towards things which are<lb facs="P35_TL00032"/>beautiful and beyond his power either to create<lb facs="P35_TL00033"/>or understand; through these infirmities he<lb facs="P35_TL00034"/>has unwittingly done great harm to the quite<lb facs="P35_TL00035"/>unprejudiced minds of the English Playgoers.<lb facs="P35_TL00036"/>Besides this Mr Archer has never, so far as<lb facs="P35_TL00037"/>we know, written a play,... and if he has we<lb facs="P35_TL00038"/>have heard very little about it. Mr Archer is<lb facs="P35_TL00039"/>therefore one of the last people to be of any<lb facs="P35_TL00040"/>vital use in such a matter..^<lb facs="P35_TL00041"/>After a work is finished, and while the world<lb facs="P35_TL00042"/>is criticising it, the professional critic has the<lb facs="P35_TL00043"/>same liberty as the public to give his opinion,<lb facs="P35_TL00044"/>and he has the added advantage of being able<lb facs="P35_TL00045"/>to express the opinion in public. But when<lb facs="P35_TL00046"/>the critic over-steps the limits of discretion,<lb facs="P35_TL00047"/>and, with a show of valour, prepares to tussle<lb facs="P35_TL00048"/>with the Muse in private on behalf of some<lb facs="P35_TL00049"/>trembling author who is waiting in the anti<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                       <lb facs="P35_TL00050"/>chamber, this strikes us as really a little too<lb facs="P35_TL00051"/>much.<lb facs="P35_TL00052"/>Artists all the world over know quite well<lb facs="P35_TL00053"/>that when they wish for assistance there is<lb facs="P35_TL00054"/>only one man to whom they can go, and that<lb facs="P35_TL00055"/>is to the Artist. If a young painter does not<lb facs="P35_TL00056"/>know what to do he goes to another painter<lb facs="P35_TL00057"/>who is more talented, or he studies under a<lb facs="P35_TL00058"/>master of painting: but he never goes to the<lb facs="P35_TL00059"/>professional critic. In this manner he follows<lb facs="P35_TL00060"/>the custom of the carpenter, the smith, the<lb facs="P35_TL00061"/>weaver and other straightforward craftsmen.,<lb facs="P35_TL00062"/>and who is there to say he does wrong?<lb facs="P35_TL00063"/>Again, a nice book of poems we should have<lb facs="P35_TL00064"/>had if young John Keats, whom most of the<lb facs="P35_TL00065"/>critics would have liked to have 44 nipped in<lb facs="P35_TL00066"/>the bud," had submitted his masterpiece to<lb facs="P35_TL00067"/>the famous Mr Z., the writer in Blackwood's<lb facs="P35_TL00068"/>Edinburgh Magazine &amp; of one of the most stu<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

No critic can be so<lb facs="P35_TL00091"/>critical as the artist, and outside criticism<lb facs="P35_TL00092"/>has but this momentary effect on the great<lb facs="P35_TL00093"/>artists. But criticism applied to beginners, to<lb facs="P35_TL00094"/>those who are not great artists but who are<lb facs="P35_TL00095"/>talented men, is, unless it be to praise, a<lb facs="P35_TL00096"/>vile thing at best. Nevertheless, it exists. We<lb facs="P35_TL00097"/>accept it; it has grown into a convention.<lb facs="P35_TL00098"/>But that we should add to this vile thing a<lb facs="P35_TL00099"/>more vile one, that it should be proposed<lb facs="P35_TL00100"/>that one who ladles out criticism after the<lb facs="P35_TL00101"/>work is done, should ladle it out in advance<lb facs="P35_TL00102"/>while the work is being conceived, surpasses<lb facs="P35_TL00103"/>all the horrors imaginable by a man of<lb facs="P35_TL00104"/>imagination.<lb facs="P35_TL00105"/>There is something ghoul-like about such a<lb facs="P35_TL00106"/>thing, there is something uncanny and<lb facs="P35_TL00107"/>creepy about it; it suggests a new kind of<lb facs="P35_TL00108"/>vampire. The horrible stories of vampires who<lb facs="P35_TL00109"/>sucked the blood from men are not so horrible<lb facs="P35_TL00110"/>as the idea of a vampire that should prey<lb facs="P35_TL00111"/>upon something which is half-born. It would<lb facs="P35_TL00112"/>be criminal to the last degree for a man in<lb facs="P35_TL00113"/>a position such as Mr Archer proposes for<lb facs="P35_TL00114"/>himself, to nip any play in the bud, to nip<lb facs="P35_TL00115"/>any single play which any young author may<lb facs="P35_TL00116"/>have written because he, Mr Archer, thinks<lb facs="P35_TL00117"/>it is hopeless. What Mr Archer thinks<lb facs="P35_TL00118"/>he is at perfect liberty to think, but he should<lb facs="P35_TL00119"/>not be permitted to be in the position of<lb facs="P35_TL00120"/>nipping anything in the bud. There is nothing<lb facs="P35_TL00121"/>which it is necessary to nip in the bud; there<lb facs="P35_TL00122"/>is nothing which, by development, cannot<lb facs="P35_TL00123"/>advance a stage further. &amp;<lb facs="P35_TL00124"/>If some monstrosity in nature is born it is<lb facs="P35_TL00125"/>permitted to live on and it has been seen<lb facs="P35_TL00126"/>that it in no way harms itself or others. The<lb facs="P35_TL00127"/>single excuse which may be found for putting<lb facs="P35_TL00128"/>an end to life is when the life in question is<lb facs="P35_TL00129"/>miserable to itself on account of physical pain.<lb facs="P35_TL00130"/>Now, no work of art can do any harm to<lb facs="P35_TL00131"/>anyone, neither can it suffer personal pain.<lb facs="P35_TL00132"/>Therefore there is no reason for putting it<lb facs="P35_TL00133"/>out of existence.<lb facs="P35_TL00134"/>Those people who would tell us they are very<lb facs="P35_TL00135"/>grateful to this proposal of Mr Archer's and<lb facs="P35_TL00136"/>will avail themselves of it are the dunder<lb facs="P35_TL00137"/>heads, and do not count.</ab>

The artist is<lb facs="P36_TL00062"/>little concerned with the acknowledgement<lb facs="P36_TL00063"/>of his supremacy: but, like all other creators<lb facs="P36_TL00064"/>on the round globe, he likes to receive all the<lb facs="P36_TL00065"/>rights due to inferiority if the f privileges "<lb facs="P36_TL00066"/>due to the ** Superior " ones are to be witheld<lb facs="P36_TL00067"/>from him.

The climax of Rush has been<lb facs="P36_TL00083"/>reached and tomorrow will hold for us such<lb facs="P36_TL00084"/>a civilisation. Time, and the idea of time,<lb facs="P36_TL00085"/>frightens everyone. America is peopled by men<lb facs="P36_TL00086"/>and women who dread the loss of a second.<lb facs="P36_TL00087"/>We think many men must have died there<lb facs="P36_TL00088"/>through chagrin on remembering the loss of<lb facs="P36_TL00089"/>a year: and there is no doubt whatever that<lb facs="P36_TL00090"/>many beautiful women have grown swiftly<lb facs="P36_TL00091"/>old because of this fear. jg?<lb facs="P36_TL00092"/>When speaking of a woman of fifty whose<lb facs="P36_TL00093"/>expression is as young as ever, people say,<lb facs="P36_TL00094"/>"time makes no impression on her": and<lb facs="P36_TL00095"/>that is just it. She is not frightened of time:<lb facs="P36_TL00096"/>she know that she is as limitless as time and<lb facs="P36_TL00097"/>she is therefore one of those beings who<lb facs="P36_TL00098"/>belong to that civilisation which we expect<lb facs="P36_TL00099"/>will be with us Tomorrow. The moment<lb facs="P36_TL00100"/>that a million men and women will look upon<lb facs="P36_TL00101"/>time without fear, that moment shall we be<lb facs="P36_TL00102"/>in the ideal state. All men and women will<lb facs="P36_TL00103"/>look beautiful and will act beautifully because<lb facs="P36_TL00104"/>time will be at their service. And this is<lb facs="P36_TL00105"/>what has always raised the artist above his<lb facs="P36_TL00106"/>fellows, this sense that he is master of time.</ab>

" JS?<lb facs="P37_TL00028"/>Mr George Alexander being a man with a<lb facs="P37_TL00029"/>sense of humour evidently wished to score a<lb facs="P37_TL00030"/>point for music and musicians by relating this<lb facs="P37_TL00031"/>genial sarcasm uttered by Sir Arthur Sullivan.<lb facs="P37_TL00032"/>What exactly Mr George Alexander was<lb facs="P37_TL00033"/>aiming at is not clear. Perhaps he wished to<lb facs="P37_TL00034"/>show quite simply that soft music is a nuisance<lb facs="P37_TL00035"/>in the theatre, and quoted Sis Arthur Sullivan<lb facs="P37_TL00036"/>in support of his argument. As a matter of<lb facs="P37_TL00037"/>fact musicians do not relish the idea of writing<lb facs="P37_TL00038"/>incidental music to punctuate the voices of<lb facs="P37_TL00039"/>the players, for the music is seldom properly<lb facs="P37_TL00040"/>heard, is played pianissimo, is often cut here,<lb facs="P37_TL00041"/>there and everywhere, and the Muse of Music<lb facs="P37_TL00042"/>is not pleased by this position of her<lb facs="P37_TL00043"/>The late Sir Henry Irving, it is reported,<lb facs="P37_TL00044"/>spent vast sums of money on the purchase<lb facs="P37_TL00045"/>of incidental music for the theatre, Sir<lb facs="P37_TL00046"/>Arthur Sullivan, Sir H. Mackenzie, Edward<lb facs="P37_TL00047"/>German and Sir Villiars Stanford supplying<lb facs="P37_TL00048"/>him with the goods; but to write music which<lb facs="P37_TL00049"/>should accompany the voice of an Irving may<lb facs="P37_TL00050"/>be some excuse for a bad practise, and every<lb facs="P37_TL00051"/>rule has its exceptions. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P37_TL00052"/>It is of course well known that incidental<lb facs="P37_TL00053"/>music is comparatively unknown in the other<lb facs="P37_TL00054"/>European centres, such music being regarded<lb facs="P37_TL00055"/>as an entirely illegitimate means of heightening<lb facs="P37_TL00056"/>the significance of a drama. The audiences in<lb facs="P37_TL00057"/>the continental cities would object to this<lb facs="P37_TL00058"/>irritating tinkle because at best it can only<lb facs="P37_TL00059"/>make but a sentimental appeal, allied as it<lb facs="P37_TL00060"/>is to moments of dramatic sentiment. These<lb facs="P37_TL00061"/>audiences are glad to avoid sentiment as<lb facs="P37_TL00062"/>much as possible so that they may get deeper<lb facs="P37_TL00063"/>under the skin of the drama. In the English<lb facs="P37_TL00064"/>Theatre false sentiment reigns supreme in a<lb facs="P37_TL00065"/>mawkish kind of way, and it is only innovators<lb facs="P37_TL00066"/>like Mr Granville Barker who are bold enough<lb facs="P37_TL00067"/>to release us from the tasteless tyranny of<lb facs="P37_TL00068"/>sentiment gone to seed. &amp;</ab>

I cannot guess<lb facs="P37_TL00090"/>44 what Mr Bernard Shaw can mean. Years ago<lb facs="P37_TL00091"/>44 when I was a boy, and Mr Shaw in his prime,<lb facs="P37_TL00092"/>441 made an experiment or two with some<lb facs="P37_TL00093"/>44 draped stuff instead of scenery, but that was<lb facs="P37_TL00094"/>44 because the theatre was not rich enough<lb facs="P37_TL00095"/>44 to run to wood and canvas. I was excused<lb facs="P37_TL00096"/>44 the offence I suppose on account of my<lb facs="P37_TL00097"/>44youth, but I gather that Mr Shaw is quite<lb facs="P37_TL00098"/>44 old enough to know better. &amp;<lb facs="P37_TL00099"/>44 I suppose it is this old threadbare curtain<lb facs="P37_TL00100"/>44 idea which Mr Shaw is alluding t0... and I<lb facs="P37_TL00101"/>44 hope for his own sake he will find it of a<lb facs="P37_TL00102"/>44 piece with his plays. If he is keen about it<lb facs="P37_TL00103"/>44 he is perfectly welcome to it. Why not ?...<lb facs="P37_TL00104"/>44 everyone may borrow ideas, but I feel that<lb facs="P37_TL00105"/>44 it's alway best to borrow the latest,... they<lb facs="P37_TL00106"/>44are so much more likely to be fresh.

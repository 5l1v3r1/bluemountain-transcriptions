                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>Sir, I am glad to see that in the midst of so much fuss about the 44 vile Censor "<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>44 The Mask" keeps its head. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>We don't want these uncensored plays, especially since the authors have shown us<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>lately what kind of matter such plays deal in.

                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>hese two letters have lately reached me, and in view of these and of the questions<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>put by many supporters of " The Mask " I feel that it is time for me to set before<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>its readers my reasons for not attacking the Censor. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>To begin with the mob which is hunting him is made up of the last people in England<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>who have any justice in doing so.<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>The excuses they offer are many. Most of them are the excuses of the martyr, and we<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>have learnt by experience that a crying martyr is a fraud. &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>The second reason is that 1 believe entirely in the principle, and if 1 fail to praise the<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>present Censor it is only because he does not carry the principle far e nough. It is not less,<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>but more Censor, that the theatre needs. &amp; jg?<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>&amp; The present Censor permits what I hope no other Censor will permit again,... he allows<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>London to be flooded by vulgarity. The shows at the music halls do not count. We expect,<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>vulgarity there; and the Censor tolerates more than vulgarity there for he knows that the<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>Music Hall is the property of the mob and he also remembers that it was once much worse<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>and that even the Emperors of Constantinople, Rome and Alexandria were unable to censor<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>such exhibitions.<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>But the Theatre is not the property of the mob and is not a place for exhibitions, animal<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>or human.<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>For what then is the Theatre? The reply is given us by the historians, It is for<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>Religion. jg?<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>&amp; You will possibly imagine that the Censor would oppose a theatre entirely dedicated<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>to Religion. If so you must be wrong, and that is shown by the plain fact that he censors<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>all which in his belief is non religious. &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00039"/>&amp; You will now possibly tell me that I am wrong and that he vetos plays which are reli<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00040"/>gious. But here we come to the heart of the matter. So-called Religious Plays are not<lb facs="P5_TL00041"/>religious any more than books with religious titles are Religious. " Bethlehem " which the<lb facs="P5_TL00042"/>Censor refused to sanction for public performance was not Religious; nor was "Eagerheart"<lb facs="P5_TL00043"/>which somehow got through.

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>dern authors who clamour for the Censor's removal are frankly non-religious and would<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>possibly like to be atheistical; and it is even more because their reasons for the abolition<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>of the Censor are bad than because the arguments in favour of that office are good that<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>" The Mask " gives, and will continue to give, the Censor its support. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>Sir William Gilbert in his evidence at the recent enquiry supports the principle of the<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>Censor and points out that the stage is not a pulpit, but that, should no restraint be<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>exercised, there seems to be a possible danger of its becoming a pulpit of the socialist and<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>the anarchist. &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree supports the Censor chiefly, so we are led to believe, be<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

For my part 1 should be very glad to see acted a few of those plays by Mr Bernard Shaw<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>which the present Censor prohibits on account of what he believes to be their immorality,<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>but I should not like to see the hundreds of daring plays, the ugliness masquerading as force,<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>which would be let loose on to the stage as the result of this privilege being allowed to<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>Mr Shaw. For so long as English drawing rooms are what they are and the English<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>householder is what he is, so long will it be impossible to discuss in a theatre, without<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>danger, matters which are never breathed inside an English home. <lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>&amp; It may be urged that freedom is permitted to the Continental theatres and that it is<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>unreasonable that in a country which, above all others, boasts of its freedom, any restric<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>tion should be in force. But this question turns on the difference between the blood and<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>brains of the Englishman and the Foreigner, and for my part 1 do not want the Englishman<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>any different from what he is. &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>This matter of the value of the Censorship might, however, easily be put to a practical<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>test. JZ? J2? &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>&amp; To that end I should like to see it possible for certain theatres and certain authors to<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>be given freedom in such matters, and I think that this experiment might soon settle the<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>whole matter in a very few years. What* should there be against a license being given<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>to the Court Theatre with a special license to Mr Bernard Shaw and Mr Granville Barker<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>to give the public just what they want to give them? The Court Theatre wrould then be<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>known as the " Free Theatre " and the public would soon decide whether or not this free<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>new theatre were better than the old one. JZ? JZ? JZ?<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>If Mr Bernard Shaw's influence is for good a few years liberty will prove it, and after<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>all it is men of independent thought whose works all Englishmen desire to hear. But if,<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>on the other hand, Mr. Bernard Shaw is merely the mouthpiece of an unruly section of<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>society, in a few years this also would become quite evident instead of only rather evident<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>as it is today.<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>£&gt; I have said that if anything the power of the Censor is not carried far enough, and 1<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>believe it to be in this fact that the weakness of the system lies. It is true that he may<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>veto any idea, any word, or any suggestion which is in the written text; but what<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>control has he over the interpretation? Yet it is in the interpretation, even more than in the<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>words themselves, that the danger may lie. This fact has escaped most people. Yet if we<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>consider it for a moment there is hardly any line in any play to which a double entendre<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>cannot be given, and even " How do you do, Mrs Jones " can be made positively indecent<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>by the way in which it Is said and the gestures by which it is accompanied. &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>&lt;£/ And it does not stop there; for without saying a word an actor is able to be as gross<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>as he pleases. And if the grasp of the Censor is not relaxed from the wrist of the writer<lb facs="P6_TL00056"/>the writer will use his other hand. He will learn how to write innocent conversations and<lb facs="P6_TL00057"/>then he will instruct the actor how to interpret them; and as far as 1 can see it will be<lb facs="P6_TL00058"/>impossible to stop the actor from doing so. &amp; <lb facs="P6_TL00059"/>What action would be taken if such a thing should come to pass ? And what is the use<lb facs="P6_TL00060"/>of making a law when you cannot enforce it or when it can be easily evaded ? It would</ab>

He<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>sees the crowd sleeping over the dishes, rhapsodists with lyres and maidens who had<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>twined wreaths here: he sees courtiers who, having put aside their broadswords have fallen,<lb facs="P16_TL00038"/>wearied, into sleep.

In their midst<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>the drowned corpse of the knight Cracus intones a lamentation over his fate. The serpents<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>and holy dragons emerge from the waters and devour his body, monstrous water-spirits<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>are consuming from his sack the grain he was to have sown. His grain is going to nothing,<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>the fields will go fallow, his house will be in embers.

The Chorus in a sung intermezzo lauds the sunrise and glorious victory<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>which the New Leader had gained that night over the invaders. The Vistula reddens with<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>the blood of the slain. Horns sound. The Nation gathers on the bank in festal dress praising<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>summer and fruitful times in ceremonial chants. In the retinue of victorious peasants<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>appears the golden Knight=Maiden. The fiddlers strike up a wedding march. Vanda steps<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>on to the raft with the army so as to cross over to the Burg. The old harper with an<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>immense wreath of flowers and compears on his head is before her as mediator from the<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>People prostrating himself and begging her in a betrothal song to accept the government<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>of the nation. As a sign of agreement Vanda doffs her winged helmet, which the harper,<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>fixing on a pike, shows to the people. The Chorus sings a coronation hymn. The raft is on<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>the move towards the Burg when suddenly, from the watery depths, emerges the ondine<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>chorus, reminding her that on her brow she wears a crimson Vistula wreath and that as the<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>Siren who had saved the people by charms she must descend to the bottom as she had<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>vowed the previous night. The raft begins to sink, rent by the hands of Vistula spirits. The<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>people, affrighted by the spells, flees to the shore. On the raft the Maiden King remains<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>alone unheeding the appeals of the chorus of the people; gazes into the charmed whirlpool<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>from which arise the walls of the Castle " in gold and blue from foot to summit " where<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>Fame will celebrate her nuptials; gazes into the charmed whirlpool and a wedding process<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>sion appears to her luring her with a joyous nuptial hymn, and she sees the stern face of<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>the old King whose grey beard had grown into a coral bush. In vain the chorus of people<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>implores Vanda to cast away the enchanted wreath. The Maiden=Hero will not deprive<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>herself of the wreath of the glory; she stands as though turned to stone on the raft having<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>raised the sword high in the air. The People wishes to tear the flower crown from her<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>temples. Too late.

And the chorus of waves brings him on its crests the inanimate body of fair-haired<lb facs="P19_TL00018"/>Penhesilea, which Achilles awakening with a kiss again gives to the water, saying Goodnight,<lb facs="P19_TL00019"/>to his love, since his heart had ceased to love with an earthly love. And we shall see him<lb facs="P19_TL00020"/>again in his tent conversing of his destiny with his mother, the silvery goddess, surrounded<lb facs="P19_TL00021"/>by the chorus of mermaids.

And about his tent stirs the girl<lb facs="P19_TL00029"/>called Night, the daughter of a fisher.

A murmur floats from the<lb facs="P20_TL00054"/>neighbouring park where the white stone monument of the king-hero stands. The watch is<lb facs="P20_TL00055"/>walking somewhere; their steps are to be heard. All at once the floor opens wide. Pallas<lb facs="P20_TL00056"/>Athene appears. 44 A casque of red brass covers her countenance and her eyes burn in the<lb facs="P20_TL00057"/>vizier; her garment gleams with the reflection of the moon; in one hand she wields silvery<lb facs="P20_TL00058"/>Aegis rattling with living serpents, in the other a lance which she drives into the earth.<lb facs="P20_TL00059"/>Amidst thunder and lightning she summons the victorious spirits from Marathon, Salamina,<lb facs="P20_TL00060"/>Thermopylae.

And among them is<lb facs="P21_TL00003"/>the haughty Nike of Phidias, a giantess, who is here called the Nike of Napoleonidae. And<lb facs="P21_TL00004"/>here too is the Nike from Cheronaca; she has entered here, pale, her mouth drawn. A black<lb facs="P21_TL00005"/>veil floats from her head. Her crape garments have absorbed the odour of the cemetery.<lb facs="P21_TL00006"/>She carries fir wreaths which she throws to the ground. She now clasps her hands<lb facs="P21_TL00007"/>in despair, now raises them tragically above her head, continually repeating one word,<lb facs="P21_TL00008"/>44 Woe!" And Pallas calls them all to eagle flight allotting to each a particular mission.<lb facs="P21_TL00009"/>For today Poland is going to fight against the Czar.

Night. On<lb facs="P21_TL00019"/>the panes flit shadows, as though some people were wandering in the garden. The howling<lb facs="P21_TL00020"/>of the wind outside can be heard and the crackling of dried twigs. Alarm creeps into the<lb facs="P21_TL00021"/>soul of the Grand Duke. The November Night. For November is a dangerous month for<lb facs="P21_TL00022"/>Poland since then the soul can come among the living and associate with them. The soul<lb facs="P21_TL00023"/>of Joan, a Pole, the wife and lover of the Grand Duke, is overcome by strange forebodings.<lb facs="P21_TL00024"/>In her dreams she sees the Grand Duke in the madness of Ares, crushing the power of the<lb facs="P21_TL00025"/>Czar his brother, and putting himself at the head of his brethren.

The<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>garden talks.... The youthful heroes are plunged in painful meditation; and now, to the<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>melodious murmur of the trees the monument rises in a flood of light, rises in his stirrups<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>and points to the Palace as though giving them the word of command. Those are shadows<lb facs="P21_TL00033"/>of trees 0n1y... and again to the melodious murmur of the trees come two women and pass<lb facs="P21_TL00034"/>through the ranks of young men; they come slowly, in a hearty embrace. That is Demeter<lb facs="P21_TL00035"/>taking leave of her daughter Cora. Rime has already bleached the leaves, therefore the<lb facs="P21_TL00036"/>maiden, impelled by a terrible inexorable force, must descend to the underground kingdom<lb facs="P21_TL00037"/>of Orcus. She consoles the lamenting mother, who is taking leave of her as though for all<lb facs="P21_TL00038"/>eternity, telling her that it is a country 44 where everlasting strengths are interred, there<lb facs="P21_TL00039"/>all life has its existence and is waiting till the dawn will glimmer for it, is waiting till its<lb facs="P21_TL00040"/>time will come to shine forth in all its beauty. 44 Rich are the garners of that realm, for in<lb facs="P21_TL00041"/>them carefully stored is the grain of all fruits. She is the guardian of this grain until the<lb facs="P21_TL00042"/>time will come when the first ice will break. Then rising again for the great feast of seedtime,<lb facs="P21_TL00043"/>she brings this treasured grain out into the world, which vivifies with flowers and bears<lb facs="P21_TL00044"/>manifold fruits. She tells her mother to prepare for that joyful time, when she will return<lb facs="P21_TL00045"/>in an immortal garland, ploughshares, harrows. But that which will live must die today<lb facs="P21_TL00046"/>on this November Night.

Demeter is lost into the garden. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00050"/>The youths standing under the white monument wake as though from sleep. Cadets<lb facs="P21_TL00051"/>run up and give the word for the attack on Belvedere. The chorus of youths runs off first<lb facs="P21_TL00052"/>having saluted the white king.

About the stage of the little theatre<lb facs="P22_TL00013"/>decorated for the vaudeville with song which is being performed, wander lively deities of<lb facs="P22_TL00014"/>derision, Satyrs in costumes of the supers of the ballet. The uninvited guests disturb the<lb facs="P22_TL00015"/>action of the piece by their episodes, imitating the Grand Duke with his adjutant, singing<lb facs="P22_TL00016"/>revolutionary songs in chorus, prompting the actors with words not included in the text<lb facs="P22_TL00017"/>and uncensurable.<lb facs="P22_TL00018"/>The despairing stage manager who had carelessly stepped on to the flap trap disappears<lb facs="P22_TL00019"/>under the stage at a sign from a satyr.

In the midst of this consternation the Nike of Napaleonidae rushes into the<lb facs="P22_TL00022"/>auditorium from the street, announces the outbreak of the insurrection and clears the theatre<lb facs="P22_TL00023"/>with the words of Adrienne Lecouvreur; " G0...

The frenzy of Ares seizes<lb facs="P22_TL00032"/>the soldiers who follow blindly in his lead unheeding the counsels of Pallas. The stage<lb facs="P22_TL00033"/>becomes covered with corpses. Along the walls steal in Caerae, carrion spirits who cast<lb facs="P22_TL00034"/>themselves on the slain, bend over them and suck their blood. In Scene 8 the action is<lb facs="P22_TL00035"/>transported to the Palace. The scenery represents the vestibule with a colonnade. Withered<lb facs="P22_TL00036"/>shrubs and cypresses. The chorus of the goddesses of victory lead in Ares as Triumpher. They<lb facs="P22_TL00037"/>divest him of his bloody armour, present to him a goblet with wine and light thanksgiving<lb facs="P22_TL00038"/>incense in tripods.^<lb facs="P22_TL00039"/>Ares, struck by the dart which the statue of Eros flings at him, feels an influx of love in<lb facs="P22_TL00040"/>his heart. The goddesses singing a bridal song lead up to him from the depth of the palace<lb facs="P22_TL00041"/>the dream-sick Joan clothed in a large white veil and a white starry dress. Joan yields to the<lb facs="P22_TL00042"/>dreamed-of god and allows him to lead her towards the palace door. In the doorway, however,<lb facs="P22_TL00043"/>she halts, looking at the Goddesses of Victory who are folding their wings and laying<lb facs="P22_TL00044"/>themselves down to sleep in the vestibule of the palace, placing under their heads wreaths<lb facs="P22_TL00045"/>triumph. Joan's brow darkens with trouble. This means they will fight no longer! " That<lb facs="P22_TL00046"/>is wrong " she whispers. In the vestibule of the palace appears Queen Cora.

The<lb facs="P27_TL00020"/>best proof of this is given by his 44 contemporary dramas " which species, the favourite of<lb facs="P27_TL00021"/>naturalists, was of their theatre the one pride, the one prop and the one...., weak point<lb facs="P27_TL00022"/>at the same time.

                                    <lb facs="P27_TL00024"/>out either adding to or taking from its substance. I am thinking here not only of the<lb facs="P27_TL00025"/>dramas in which the fantastic element meets visibly with the real (as in 44 Delivrance ",<lb facs="P27_TL00026"/>44 The Wedding") but also of those most 44 Greek " dramas, (44 The Curse" and 44 Judges")<lb facs="P27_TL00027"/>whose scene of action is exclusively on earthly ground.<lb facs="P27_TL00028"/>Wyspianski's theatre serves Truth. That Truth, which manifested itself in the hieratical<lb facs="P27_TL00029"/>theatre of antiquity and which today only the eye of the clairvoyant Genius can read from<lb facs="P27_TL00030"/>the Stars.<lb facs="P27_TL00031"/>&amp; Wyspianski's theatre however never ceases to be a theatre. Above all, the construction<lb facs="P27_TL00032"/>of his dramas is theatrical, and, incomplete in reading,gain their real expression only in the<lb facs="P27_TL00033"/>scenic frame. His favourite form is the drama not divided into Acts but into 44 dramatic<lb facs="P27_TL00034"/>scenes " a series of tableaux forming,each one apart a certain whole, closely united neverthe<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P27_TL00035"/>less with the course of the principal action and harmonising with the fundamental tonality<lb facs="P27_TL00036"/>and colouring of the work. The substance of these single scenes he so encloses in the melody<lb facs="P27_TL00037"/>of mimics that they become a sequence of spectacles in the principal spectacle. He applies<lb facs="P27_TL00038"/>the same technique also to dramas divided into longer acts, terminating each act with a<lb facs="P27_TL00039"/>finale expressed either vocally or musically, striving however in the first place for the<lb facs="P27_TL00040"/>rounding of it in the gesticulations of the soloists or in the choric groups. &amp;<lb facs="P27_TL00041"/>Some have tried to call Wyspianski's dramas pictorial. In my opinion on account of<lb facs="P27_TL00042"/>their exquisite theatricality they should rather be called in all modesty theatrical.<lb facs="P27_TL00043"/>Wyspianski, the initiate of the spirit of the art of the theatre, conscious of its aims and<lb facs="P27_TL00044"/>limits, is concerned only with Action, only with Movement.... its Birth, Development and<lb facs="P27_TL00045"/>Death. In his spectacles the mimic element forms the essential part. We meet with but few<lb facs="P27_TL00046"/>dramas in which so much space would be consecrated as here to mimic art, to choric<lb facs="P27_TL00047"/>manoevres, processions, pantomimes, the dumb play of the soloists or even to complete<lb facs="P27_TL00048"/>pauses in the action.<lb facs="P27_TL00049"/>Wyspianski's pictorial talent expresses itself in its own field. In the theatre Wyspianski<lb facs="P27_TL00050"/>avails himself of other means. He avoids painted cloths as far as possible. He fills the stage<lb facs="P27_TL00051"/>with plastic architecture and animates it with the light which, subject to the logic of his<lb facs="P27_TL00052"/>artism, becomes here an immensely important factor. &amp; &amp; JS&gt; &amp;<lb facs="P27_TL00053"/>&amp; One of Wyspianski's merits too is the ennoblng of the vocal element and the justification<lb facs="P27_TL00054"/>%<lb facs="P27_TL00055"/>of its existence in the theatre. Wyspianski in his dramas operates with theatrical voice and<lb facs="P27_TL00056"/>verb. His voice and verb harmonize with the colour of sentiments and in consequence with<lb facs="P27_TL00057"/>the spirit and colouring of the whole drama. Voice and verb are here epigrams on the mimic<lb facs="P27_TL00058"/>notions, and it never happens contrariwise. We never meet here wih pseudo-classic tirade,<lb facs="P27_TL00059"/>even in scenes in which actors receive a formidable melic or recitative part to deliver. For</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P28_TL00002"/>Wyspianski composes the partition of his drama not in written verb which only in reading<lb facs="P28_TL00003"/>has to produce an impression, but in the symbol of the 44 living verb " which in delivrance<lb facs="P28_TL00004"/>only obtains its expression. £?<lb facs="P28_TL00005"/>Wyspianski owes the strength and virility of his language to popular talk and poetry,<lb facs="P28_TL00006"/>preserving the onomatopaeic character of that speech with which the primitive man might<lb facs="P28_TL00007"/>have served himself, Wyspianski studies this material, transforms it artistically until at last<lb facs="P28_TL00008"/>he creates for his theatre verb-sound, verb colour, which he uses economically, careful<lb facs="P28_TL00009"/>of the sentimental and mimic substrate on which they must develop themselves logically.<lb facs="P28_TL00010"/>Every creative reader of Wyspianski's dramas may convince himself of the pictorial value<lb facs="P28_TL00011"/>of his verb and likewise of its practical significance for the theatre; when representing the<lb facs="P28_TL00012"/>drama in the theatre of his own soul he will find, in the spoken text of the drama indica<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Above all<lb facs="P28_TL00020"/>we meet it in two dramas, born 44Aus dem Qeiste der Musik": in 44 The Wedding" where<lb facs="P28_TL00021"/>the whole action is spun on the background of the magic melody of a peasant dance, and<lb facs="P28_TL00022"/>in 44 La Varsovienne " in which the song of E. Delavigne played on an old clavichord winds<lb facs="P28_TL00023"/>itself slowly through the whole drama with a red thread. We meet it in 44 The Legend "<lb facs="P28_TL00024"/>which is filled with solo airs and solo recitations, songs and choral melodeclamations; we<lb facs="P28_TL00025"/>meet it in " Boleslas ", 44 The November Night " 44 Acropolis ", in the antique 44 Greek "<lb facs="P28_TL00026"/>dramas and in the dramas most Greek; in the contemporary dramas. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P28_TL00027"/>Wyspianski does not illustrate his dramas with music, he does not stuff the mimic and<lb facs="P28_TL00028"/>poetical text with loose interpolations either symphonic or sung. The musical part on his<lb facs="P28_TL00029"/>stage plays an equal role with the poetical part and is no ornament patched in; it is<lb facs="P28_TL00030"/>theatrically and logically justified, is important and necessary. Orchestral and vocal music<lb facs="P28_TL00031"/>Wyspianski uses then and then only when the Action demands it. In 44 The Legend " old<lb facs="P28_TL00032"/>harpers sing ballads to the dead king to the strain of those songs of blind beggars<lb facs="P28_TL00033"/>wandering about from kermess to kermess and the song and declamation of water gods flow<lb facs="P28_TL00034"/>from the depths of the waters in the rhyme and rhythm of peasant ditties; in 44 Achilles "<lb facs="P28_TL00035"/>Andromaque sings over the infant's cradle a lullaby of the judgement of Paris reminding in<lb facs="P28_TL00036"/>its simplicity of popular songs; in like manner he twines song with the action in 44 Boleslas<lb facs="P28_TL00037"/>the Bold", in 44 The Rock", in 44 The November Night ", in 44 The Death of Ophelia", etc,<lb facs="P28_TL00038"/>not for the purpose of showing off the actor, not for the pleasure and amusement of the<lb facs="P28_TL00039"/>spectator, not to save the spectacle but for the self-same reason which leads him to the<lb facs="P28_TL00040"/>use of the verb.<lb facs="P28_TL00041"/>Wyspianski's personages sing and speak only when logical necessity demands it, they sing<lb facs="P28_TL00042"/>and speak what the people in a given drama may feel, what in the depths of their souls<lb facs="P28_TL00043"/>arranges ltselLto melody hence the musicality of the text. In Wyspianski's dramas<lb facs="P28_TL00044"/>Nature sings and speaks when action demands it, she speaks in that sincere voice of hers<lb facs="P28_TL00045"/>which is audible only for her contemplators and not for scrutators and artistic imitators<lb facs="P28_TL00046"/>In his dramas we neither meet with elaborate diversions nor those symphonic entr'actes<lb facs="P28_TL00047"/>nor with tremolo preludes. In Wyspianski's dramas music sounds then only when nature as<lb facs="P28_TL00048"/>visible (impersonified or not) 44 dramatis persona " appears, when act and speak she will As<lb facs="P28_TL00049"/>the whole orchestra he uses lyres, harps, shepherd flutes, war horns mingled with the<lb facs="P28_TL00050"/>clanking of arms, the rustle of the wind, the ripple of the water, the clap of the thunder,<lb facs="P28_TL00051"/>and even silence, a fermata placed over the mimic vocal text.<lb facs="P28_TL00052"/>&amp; In Wyspianski's dramas either complete silence or interupted by a quiet accompaniment<lb facs="P28_TL00053"/>of words or sound rings in the ear of the spectator with that whole orchestra of indefinable<lb facs="P28_TL00054"/>mysterious, hardly conscious tones, resounding in the soul of a maid In communion with<lb facs="P28_TL00055"/>the Peace and Silence of nature.

It is they who travel<lb facs="P30_TL00031"/>In the imagination and who realise the unlimited possibilities of that Holy Land.<lb facs="P30_TL00032"/>In the olden days a marionette performance was called a ' Motion', and this * Motion ,<lb facs="P30_TL00033"/>took place in silence.

                                    <lb facs="P31_TL00013"/>ted mechanism as in the case of the Chinese figures. We must realise that the whole thing<lb facs="P31_TL00014"/>is a little matter of a very little mechanism. Pull a string, an arm goes up; another<lb facs="P31_TL00015"/>string and it bends, another string, and it comes round. Nowadays a man controls all this<lb facs="P31_TL00016"/>but might it not perhaps be possible that at a later date we may have these little figures<lb facs="P31_TL00017"/>brought to so great a mechanical perfection that they may not need the assistance of that<lb facs="P31_TL00018"/>human machine, man<lb facs="P31_TL00019"/>Bernardino Baldi, Abbot of Guastalla, who was both poet and geometrician and who<lb facs="P31_TL00020"/>wrote of Marionettes in 1589, declares a knowledge of mathematics to be essential to their<lb facs="P31_TL00021"/>construction , and the value of such knowledge to both the constructor and the manipu<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P31_TL00022"/>lator is easy to understand.<lb facs="P31_TL00023"/>We are told that in Greece a life sized figure was once made by an artist mechanic in<lb facs="P31_TL00024"/>such away that without assistance if could move its legs and arms and advance upon the<lb facs="P31_TL00025"/>beholders to whom it gave a blessing. This movement was caused by the mercury with<lb facs="P31_TL00026"/>which it was filled, the inward construction of the figure setting the mercury in motion<lb facs="P31_TL00027"/>and this, in its turn, setting in motion the figure; while mention is made of such a figure<lb facs="P31_TL00028"/>by Aristotle, who admits that it was the mercury which she contained which gave movement<lb facs="P31_TL00029"/>to the famous wooden Venus attributed to Daedolus.<lb facs="P31_TL00030"/>Another means of causing the figures to move was by the power of a magnet, of which<lb facs="P31_TL00031"/>we have an example in the inscription given by Diodore of the ceremonies which took<lb facs="P31_TL00032"/>place in the temple of Heliopolis. - " When the god wished to deliver his oracle" he<lb facs="P31_TL00033"/>tells us, " the statue, which was of gold, moved of itself; if the priests delayed to raise<lb facs="P31_TL00034"/>it on their shoulders it struggled and moved again. When they had taken it and placed it<lb facs="P31_TL00035"/>on a litter it led them and obliged them to make several turns. At last the high priest<lb facs="P31_TL00036"/>presented himself before the statue of the god and put to him the questions on which it<lb facs="P31_TL00037"/>was wished to consult him. If Apollon disapproved of the enterprise the statue drew back; if<lb facs="P31_TL00038"/>he approved of it it pushed its bearers forward as if drawing them with reins. " And he<lb facs="P31_TL00039"/>adds in conclusion, " the priests having taken the statue on their shoulders it left them on<lb facs="P31_TL00040"/>the ground and raised itself quite alone towards the vault of the temple ". <lb facs="P31_TL00041"/>Now there seems no reason why my keen, clever and energetic countrymen, especially<lb facs="P31_TL00042"/>those who dwell in Berlin, should not soon master these matters of mercury and magnet<lb facs="P31_TL00043"/>and produce some figures capable of exquisite, if mechanical, movement. Though even then<lb facs="P31_TL00044"/>the difficulty would not be ended, for it is one thing to make a piece of mechanism and<lb facs="P31_TL00045"/>another to set it to its right use, and after the mechanism of these figures is made perhaps<lb facs="P31_TL00046"/>we shall have to go to France or England to find those who shall know how to extract<lb facs="P31_TL00047"/>and conjure some beauty from it all. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00048"/>For what artists the young Englishmen are beside the Americans, in so many traits akin<lb facs="P31_TL00049"/>to us I By the side of these how an Englishman shines !

" J® J® J® J®<lb facs="P32_TL00011"/>J® As to their true origin theories may vary.

But I would rather incline<lb facs="P32_TL00014"/>to the theory put forward by Mr Magnin, in support of which he cites Heroditus and other<lb facs="P32_TL00015"/>ancient writers, that the marionettes are descended from those jointed statuettes which,<lb facs="P32_TL00016"/>in celebration of the feast of Bacchus, the Egyptian women bore from village to village;<lb facs="P32_TL00017"/>and in the figure of Jupitor Ammon which, carried in procession on the shoulders of eighty<lb facs="P32_TL00018"/>priests, indicated the route it wished to follow by a movement of the head. j® j®<lb facs="P32_TL00019"/>j® That the Egyptians used these moving figures as means of amusement in what we today<lb facs="P32_TL00020"/>call a theatre we have no evidence, nor does it seem probable. It is true that in miniature<lb facs="P32_TL00021"/>they were used as toys for children, but their real place was in the religious ceremonies,<lb facs="P32_TL00022"/>and it was just in these ceremonies, these silent rites and movements, and not, as was<lb facs="P32_TL00023"/>once upon a time asserted, in the words of the poets, that the theatre had its birth, being<lb facs="P32_TL00024"/>born of motion, not of sound. j® j® j® j® j® j® j® j®<lb facs="P32_TL00025"/>j® Both in Egypt and Greece many little jointed figures have been found, in *wood, ivory<lb facs="P32_TL00026"/>and terra cotta, the heads set upon a pivot which permitted movement; the limbs jointed<lb facs="P32_TL00027"/>that they might be moved by means of a string, J® J® J® J® J® J®<lb facs="P32_TL00028"/>J® In Greece they had evidently been early adopted as a means of entertainment, since<lb facs="P32_TL00029"/>Xenophon relates, in connection with a famous banquet, that among the diversions provi<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

D. 44 only to draw the<lb facs="P32_TL00046"/>44 string destined to move such and such a limb; immediately one sees the neck bend, the<lb facs="P32_TL00047"/>44 head bow, the eyes take vivacity of expression, the hands lend themselves for all the<lb facs="P32_TL00048"/>44 offices required; in short, the whole person shows itself graceful and as if alive ". *®<lb facs="P32_TL00049"/>In regard to the performances given at Athens in the Theatre of Dronyus we are told<lb facs="P32_TL00050"/>by some authorities that, since the ancient theatres were ill adapted for such a use, a<lb facs="P32_TL00051"/>kind of second little stage composed of a four sided draped scaffolding was arranged upon<lb facs="P32_TL00052"/>the thymele or orchestra, so constructed as to allow the spectators to see the little actors<lb facs="P32_TL00053"/>but not the hands which manipulated them, the piece being given without words while<lb facs="P32_TL00054"/>the story was narrated by one who stood in front. One distinguished authority, however,<lb facs="P32_TL00055"/>referring to the celebrated performances given in this theatre by Pothein, opposes the idea<lb facs="P32_TL00056"/>that the figures were small ones and puts forward another theory. 44 I think, " he writes,<lb facs="P32_TL00057"/>44 that Pothein presented life-size figures or even larger than life, each of which contained<lb facs="P32_TL00058"/>44 a manipulator, and my reason for holding this view is that 1 do not find the Greeks<lb facs="P32_TL00059"/>44 lacking in a sense of proportion " Not so unlike Mr Craig's über marionette, this. <lb facs="P32_TL00060"/>j® Passing on to the middle ages we find the moving figures have again reverted to their ori<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

This document runs as follows: (i)<lb facs="P34_TL00014"/>&amp; *4 At Crawley's Booth, over against the Crown Tavern in Smithfield, during the time of<lb facs="P34_TL00015"/>44 Barrholemew Fair, will be presented a little opera, called the Old Creation of the World;<lb facs="P34_TL00016"/>44 yet newly revived ; with the ddition of Noah's Flood; also veral fountain s playing wather<lb facs="P34_TL00017"/>44 during the time of the play. The last scene does present Noach end his famfly coming<lb facs="P34_TL00018"/>44 out of the Ark, with all the beasts two and two, and all the fowls of the air seen in a<lb facs="P34_TL00019"/>44 prospect sitting upon trees; likewise over the ark is seen the Sun rising in a most<lb facs="P34_TL00020"/>44 glorious manner; moreover a multitude of Angels will be seen in a double rank ; which<lb facs="P34_TL00021"/>44 presents a double prospect, one for the sun, another for a palace, where will be seen six<lb facs="P34_TL00022"/>44 Angels ringing of bells. Likewise Machines descend from above, double and treble; with<lb facs="P34_TL00023"/>44 Dives rising out of Hell ; and Lazarus seen in Abraham's bosom ; besides several figures<lb facs="P34_TL00024"/>44 dancing jiggs, sarabands, and country dances; to the admiration of the spectators; with<lb facs="P34_TL00025"/>44 the merry conceits of squire Punch and Sir John Spendall." JZ?<lb facs="P34_TL00026"/>&amp; This curious medley was, we are told, 44 completed by an Entertainment of singing and<lb facs="P34_TL00027"/>44 dancing with several naked swords, performed by a Child of eight years of age, " &amp;<lb facs="P34_TL00028"/>A famous English puppet showman was Martin Powell, who began to distinguish himself<lb facs="P34_TL00029"/>about this time and continued under the succeeding reigns of George I, George n, George in,<lb facs="P34_TL00030"/>and we find in him something of those powers which we look for today in the Artist of the<lb facs="P34_TL00031"/>Theatre, since he was not only the author of the pieces which he put on this tiny stage,<lb facs="P34_TL00032"/>but also the maker of the puppets, (we hear of his devoting especial care to Punch, whom<lb facs="P34_TL00033"/>he endowed with a moveable jaw) the costumier and the controller of every action, and<lb facs="P34_TL00034"/>gesture.<lb facs="P34_TL00035"/>The subject of Punch and his fellows is, however, so wide and interesting a one as to<lb facs="P34_TL00036"/>call for a special and seperate study, and the same must be said of that wonderful company<lb facs="P34_TL00037"/>of marionettes which have their homes in the East, in Java, China, Burmah and Japan.<lb facs="P34_TL00038"/>To speak of the marionettes once more, therefore, in conclusion, in the general sense.<lb facs="P34_TL00039"/>Two of the most salient characteristics which chiefly impress us in them are their<lb facs="P34_TL00040"/>simplicity and their calm. The gestures which seem so varied, so complicated as to<lb facs="P34_TL00041"/>necessitate the most elaborate mechanism are produced by means amazingly simple, while<lb facs="P34_TL00042"/>a marionette 44 greenroom " between the performances is,...and in this it forms a welcome<lb facs="P34_TL00043"/>contrast to the real theatre,... as tranquil a spot as can be found. Each little figure,<lb facs="P34_TL00044"/>strangely human in its repose, hangs upon its nail in the dim light, gazing before it with<lb facs="P34_TL00045"/>eyes as inscrutable as those which yet meet ours from under the quiet brows of the gods<lb facs="P34_TL00046"/>of Egypt and Etruria. It is their silence, their passionless gaze, their profound indifference<lb facs="P34_TL00047"/>which give so supreme a dignity to the frail little bodies tricked out in gauze and tinsel.<lb facs="P34_TL00048"/>As in the fallen descendant of a great family some one trait may yet remain to recall a<lb facs="P34_TL00049"/>noble origin, so does that impassive gaze, that air of seeing beyond all the transitory and<lb facs="P34_TL00050"/>the accidental, still proclaim for the marionette his kinship with the grave stone images<lb facs="P34_TL00051"/>of the ancient eastern world. And when, in more than his former dignity and dowered with<lb facs="P34_TL00052"/>more than his former gifts, the puppet returns to our stage in the form of that Über<lb facs="P34_TL00053"/>Marionette whom Mr Gordon Graig has created, bringing with him his supreme quality,<lb facs="P34_TL00054"/>that of perfect obedience to the hand and mind of the master whom he serves as material,<lb facs="P34_TL00055"/>with him will come that Renaissance of the Art of the Theatre of which the first hints<lb facs="P34_TL00056"/>are even now beginning to appear. &amp; &amp; &amp;</ab>

Then came the Gallic invasions,<lb facs="P35_TL00014"/>the destruction of the city that Coriolanus and Tarquinus knew, and the long series of<lb facs="P35_TL00015"/>wars which at last, about b. c. 282, ended in the city of Rome dominating all Italy or rather<lb facs="P35_TL00016"/>all Italian cities, for a few Greek cities in the south of Italy still held out. Less than twenty<lb facs="P35_TL00017"/>years after the date last mentioned began the Punic Wars, the first extending from b. c. 264<lb facs="P35_TL00018"/>to b. c. 240. The result of which was that the Phoenician city Carthage transferred to Rome<lb facs="P35_TL00019"/>her rights in Sicily, and this island became the first Roman province. After twenty three<lb facs="P35_TL00020"/>years came the second Punic War, and in b. c. 149 began the third Punic War, during<lb facs="P35_TL00021"/>which Carthage was destroyed and part of its territory was annexed as a province to Rome<lb facs="P35_TL00022"/>Meanwhile, however, war was going on (b. c. 229) with the Greeks on the coast of Illyria,<lb facs="P35_TL00023"/>and the first Macedonian war began in b. e. 213. In b. c. 200 came the second Macedonian<lb facs="P35_TL00024"/>war, and in 196 the Greek1 allies of Rome were really her dependents. Still further and further<lb facs="P35_TL00025"/>did the city by the Tiber push her conquests until Greece lay almost at her feet, and the<lb facs="P35_TL00026"/>third and fourth Macedonian Wars (b. c. 171-178) ended in the subjection of Macedonia.<lb facs="P35_TL00027"/>Then came war with the Achaians; and Corinth was destroyed in b. e. 146. Now followed<lb facs="P35_TL00028"/>the conquest of Western Asia and its annexation, b. c. 133, as a Roman province. Before<lb facs="P35_TL00029"/>this, and during the Punic Wars, Rome had not only dominated Northern Italy or Cisalpine<lb facs="P35_TL00030"/>Gaul (b. c. 191), and soon after Liguria and Venetia, but had extended her power to Spain,<lb facs="P35_TL00031"/>which she had completely dominated by b.c. 133. Then we have the conquests of Mariusf<lb facs="P35_TL00032"/>followed by the social war of b.c. 90, wars in Greece and Asia, and the final success of Sulla<lb facs="P35_TL00033"/>in the civil war with Marius9 and the salvation of Rome in b. c. 83. Jerusalem was taken<lb facs="P35_TL00034"/>by Pompeius in b. c. 63, and what we call the Holy Land was from that time really subject<lb facs="P35_TL00035"/>to Rome. In b.c. 59, Caius Julius Caesar was Consul. In b.c. 60 he went into Gaul. In b.c. 49<lb facs="P35_TL00036"/>the civil war between him and his son-in-law. Pompeius, began, and on the defeat of the<lb facs="P35_TL00037"/>latter at Pharsalos Caesar was called Imperator and made Dictator for life. On March 15,<lb facs="P35_TL00038"/>b.c. 44, he was killed in the Senate—first, because he was entirely superior as a man to<lb facs="P35_TL00039"/>contemporaries, and second because certain of the senators were envious of him, or to put<lb facs="P35_TL00040"/>it more kindly, thought him too ambitious, and feared his use of power would end in abuse<lb facs="P35_TL00041"/>of it. It is to the year b.c. 44 that the action of the play of Julius Caesar belongs.<lb facs="P35_TL00042"/>Now it was not until the Empire had been founded in the person of Caesar's great<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P35_TL00043"/>nephew, Caius Julius Caesar Octavianus, who was dignified by the title of Augustus—<lb facs="P35_TL00044"/>that is to say not before b.c.27 that anything of great architectural importance happened<lb facs="P35_TL00045"/>to Rome. The Colosseum or Flavian Amphitheatre, the triumphal arches, the heavy rotunda<lb facs="P35_TL00046"/>of the Pantheon, the Column of Victory, the Tomb of Hadrian, called the Castle of St Angelo,<lb facs="P35_TL00047"/>in fact, the buildings through which the modern mind usually receives its idea of Classic<lb facs="P35_TL00048"/>Rome, belong to the Christian era, and are from one hundred to two hundred years later<lb facs="P35_TL00049"/>even than the age of Augustus. Again the fragments in the Forum of the Temples of Mi<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

"Classic" Rome, as we usually understand the phrase, really begins<lb facs="P35_TL00052"/>with the comparatively peaceful reign of Augustus. To his time belongs that bold copyism<lb facs="P35_TL00053"/>of Greek work, which has given us the three Roman editions of the Doric, lonic, and Co<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P35_TL00054"/>rinthian orders or styles. To the Augustan age belongs also that imitation of Greek art, in<lb facs="P35_TL00055"/>another form of expression, made famous by such men as Virgil, Ovid, Horace, and J&lt;ivy.<lb facs="P35_TL00056"/>It is true that in Caesar's time we have as writers, besides the great Dictator himself,<lb facs="P35_TL00057"/>Cicero and the poets Catullus and JLucretius; but the highest reach of Latin literature is</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P36_TB00003">
                                    <lb facs="P36_TL00003"/>later than Caesar, and the most distinctive, i.e. the least imitative, is, like the architecture,<lb facs="P36_TL00004"/>later even than the time of Augustus, Nevertheless, we may be tolerably certain that the<lb facs="P36_TL00005"/>days of Caesai9 Cicero9 and Catullus had an architectural expression of their own, although<lb facs="P36_TL00006"/>no doubt very inferior to the refinement of Creek art on the one hand or the viguor of<lb facs="P36_TL00007"/>the later Roman on the other hand. The importation of Greek statues might certainly have<lb facs="P36_TL00008"/>added to the art furnishing of the city, but the importation of Greek artists must not be<lb facs="P36_TL00009"/>allowed to count for much, first, because Greece itself was in its decline, and had no art<lb facs="P36_TL00010"/>comparable with that to which we usually refer as characteristic of the artistic excellence<lb facs="P36_TL00011"/>of the Hellenes; and next because if they had existed they would have felt in Rome much<lb facs="P36_TL00012"/>the same as the Jews felt long before, when they found the sorrow of their hearts enlarged<lb facs="P36_TL00013"/>and their eyes too full to sing to those who had led them away captive the melodies and<lb facs="P36_TL00014"/>songs of their own home. " By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept9 when we<lb facs="P36_TL00015"/>remembered thee9 O Sion9" has been the cry, and must ever be the cry of every human soul in<lb facs="P36_TL00016"/>the heaviness of bondage or banishment. But in saying this I do not by any means wish to<lb facs="P36_TL00017"/>imply that the Rome of b,c, 44 had no architecture worthy our attention. There may have<lb facs="P36_TL00018"/>been a great deal of truth in the saying attributed to Augustus, " I found the city of brick<lb facs="P36_TL00019"/>and left it of marble". No doubt the city of b,c, 44 was built mainly of brick, tufa, and wood,<lb facs="P36_TL00020"/>and it is quite possible, not to say probable, that the tufo walls lately discovered in the sub<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P36_TL00021"/>structure of the Flavian amphitheatre are portions of the walls on which Julius Caesar's wood<lb facs="P36_TL00022"/>amphitheatre stood. On the the other hand Cicero gave about 30.000f.f0r his house on the<lb facs="P36_TL00023"/>Palatine hill. For half a century before this marble had been used, and although L, CraSsus<lb facs="P36_TL00024"/>had only a few marble columns, not more than six, and these not more than 17 feet high, in<lb facs="P36_TL00025"/>his house (c. b. c, 95), yet M, Scaurus erected in his atrium black marble columns as much<lb facs="P36_TL00026"/>as 30 feet in height. One who wrote about a hundred years after Caesar's death tells us<lb facs="P36_TL00027"/>that in the great Dictator's time some houses were even lined with slabs of marble. But<lb facs="P36_TL00028"/>it seems these were rather exceptional cases, and that structures even partially built of<lb facs="P36_TL00029"/>marble were only for the favoured few or the richest of the patricians. The greater part<lb facs="P36_TL00030"/>of the city was unquestionably built in narrow and irregular streets lined with houses so<lb facs="P36_TL00031"/>high that in the time of Augustus a kind of building act was passed restricting the height<lb facs="P36_TL00032"/>of street fronts to 70 feet. These many-storeyed houses were let out in flats at rents<lb facs="P36_TL00033"/>arranged on a sliding scale, as in London and other towns at this day. And we may be<lb facs="P36_TL00034"/>tolerably sure that these towering tenements were built of wood or brick and roofed with<lb facs="P36_TL00035"/>thatch or shingles, for the class of people who dwelt in them were mostly either slaves or<lb facs="P36_TL00036"/>poor citizens living a wretchedly idle and dirty life. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P36_TL00037"/>Now turning to the play, we find there are eighteen scenes, the first eleven architectural,<lb facs="P36_TL00038"/>the others the plains of Philippi.<lb facs="P36_TL00039"/>The eleven are all laid in Rome, and can easily be reduced to the following six:— <lb facs="P36_TL00040"/>1. A public place (for the whole of Act i.).<lb facs="P36_TL00041"/>1, Brutus's orchard (Act ii Sc. 1).<lb facs="P36_TL00042"/>3. A room in Caesar's palace (Act ii. Sc. 2).<lb facs="P36_TL00043"/>4. Street before the house of Brutus (Act ii Sc. 3 and 4),<lb facs="P36_TL00044"/>5. The Capitol (Act iii. Sc. i).<lb facs="P36_TL00045"/>6. The Forum (Act iii. Sc 2 and 3, also Act iv. Sc. 1, for there is no reason why<lb facs="P36_TL00046"/>this short scene should not have happened under some public colonnade).<lb facs="P36_TL00047"/>This list may be still further reduced by making No. 1 serve also for Act No. 4, so that<lb facs="P36_TL00048"/>public external scenes will be limited to two, viz., a public place before the house of<lb facs="P36_TL00049"/>Brutus, and the Forum,<lb facs="P36_TL00050"/>&amp; A public place in Rome was laid out (like the streets) in a formal right-angled fashion<lb facs="P36_TL00051"/>after the fire of a, d, 64, before this time the open spaces in front of the public buildings<lb facs="P36_TL00052"/>or the houses of distinguished senators might be either regular or irregular.

For here an extra open<lb facs="P36_TL00055"/>space would be added forming a front court to the house which the Romans called the<lb facs="P36_TL00056"/>vestibulum and the Greeks npoQvpv.

                                    <lb facs="P37_TL00003"/>to say, the place of the doors or opening. The doors were nearly always in pairs, or folding<lb facs="P37_TL00004"/>and thus we find the word for the door itself generally used in the plural—fores. Some<lb facs="P37_TL00005"/>important doors were so wide as to be made in more than two folds, so that each side was<lb facs="P37_TL00006"/>folded back twice or more in itself, just like the large Japanese doors are at the present<lb facs="P37_TL00007"/>time.

                                    <lb facs="P37_TL00008"/>expended on these doors and door-cases, their great size as compared with modern propor<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P37_TL00009"/>tions, and the reverence, not to say superstition, with which the threshold was regarded,<lb facs="P37_TL00010"/>show us the paramount importance of these features in the exteriors at least of domestic<lb facs="P37_TL00011"/>classic architecture. Passing through the ostium, paved with marble, we enter the real<lb facs="P37_TL00012"/>hall, or atrium. In small houses this would amount to nothing more than an inner court<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P37_TL00013"/>yard, having a tank in the centre, with a shed roof against the four walls as a protection<lb facs="P37_TL00014"/>from both sun and rain; but in the mansions of the nobility this courtyard expands into a<lb facs="P37_TL00015"/>richly decorated quadrangle, with the impluvium and fountain in the centre; whilst busts,<lb facs="P37_TL00016"/>statues, bronze seats and tables, covered with skins or embroideries, ivories and curtains<lb facs="P37_TL00017"/>heavy with gold and crowded with needlework made the shady walks beneath the wide<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P37_TL00018"/>spreading roofs a very pleasant lounging place after breakfast, as Brutus or Cicero chatted<lb facs="P37_TL00019"/>with their friends, received clients, or snubbed deputations. Beyond the atrium facing the<lb facs="P37_TL00020"/>entrance or ostium, was a room called the tabtinum (what we should call an ante room)<lb facs="P37_TL00021"/>one side was open to the atrium, and the opposite side to the peristyle, A Passage way<lb facs="P37_TL00022"/>or fauces by its side shows that the tablinum was not used as a common corrider. The<lb facs="P37_TL00023"/>side passage was, no doubt, for the servants, and the large opening for the guests. Beyond<lb facs="P37_TL00024"/>the peristyle another broad opening called oecus9 with its attendant passage, led to the<lb facs="P37_TL00025"/>garden or orchard, so that from the front door to the garden an uninterrupted view, va<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P37_TL00026"/>ried by beautiful gradations of light and shadow, could be had whenever the curtains of<lb facs="P37_TL00027"/>the cecus and the tablinum were with-drawn. Round the two courts (the atrium and the<lb facs="P37_TL00028"/>peristyle) the various apartments of the house were arranged. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P37_TL00029"/>&amp; Such is the general plan of one of the most important houses in Pompeii, and its length<lb facs="P37_TL00030"/>from the street door to the garden entrance is about 200 feet. 1 see no reason to suppose<lb facs="P37_TL00031"/>that the first-class houses of Rome were widely different from this. Granted plenty of land<lb facs="P37_TL00032"/>at his disposal, and there is hardly a limit to the number or size of courts or peristyles a<lb facs="P37_TL00033"/>wealthy Roman aristocrat might desire—and have. There was no lack of size nor of costly<lb facs="P37_TL00034"/>furniture, no lack of slave-work in tesselated floor and encrusted wall, no want of most<lb facs="P37_TL00035"/>lovely statues from Greece, or textile fabrics from Asia, for every country that had been<lb facs="P37_TL00036"/>dominated by Rome, and that possessed artistic work worth having, contributed to make<lb facs="P37_TL00037"/>the houses of Roman nobles all glorious within. But in spite of all this there was really<lb facs="P37_TL00038"/>no architecture—artistically speaking. And in this sense any one of the buildings of the<lb facs="P37_TL00039"/>Athenian Acropolis, Parthenon, Propylaea or Erectheium would have outweighed all Rome.<lb facs="P37_TL00040"/>The first scene of the third act is described as laid in the Capitol. Now the Capitolium<lb facs="P37_TL00041"/>properly so called, was the temple on the Mons Capitolinus—the triple shrine of JUPITER<lb facs="P37_TL00042"/>JUNO and MINERVA already referred to in my notes on the play of Coriolanus. (1) The old<lb facs="P37_TL00043"/>Etruscan building of Tarquinius Priscus that CORIOLANUS saw had been burnt down<lb facs="P37_TL00044"/>b, c, 83), rebuilt by SULLA and dedicated b, c, 69. Imposing it possibly was not; rich in all<lb facs="P37_TL00045"/>sorts of borrowed art it may have been, but we must not confound it with the work of<lb facs="P37_TL00046"/>DOMITIAN, that temple which was 200 feet square, to which 100 steps ascended, whose<lb facs="P37_TL00047"/>gates were of bronze, and whose ceilings and tiles were overlaid with gold at a cost of<lb facs="P37_TL00048"/>12,000 talents. The temple of the year b,c, 69 was no doubt less sumptuous than its successor;<lb facs="P37_TL00049"/>and if we may accept as any evidence the coins of VESPASIAN, it was not much superior,<lb facs="P37_TL00050"/>to the Etruscan example. Like the medieval Councils and Parliaments of England, the Senate<lb facs="P37_TL00051"/>met at different places, in accordance with the summons of the Consul. It was in the<lb facs="P37_TL00052"/>Temple of Jupiter Stator, on the Palatine, that the Senate met on the important occasion<lb facs="P37_TL00053"/>when was enacted the great parliamentary scene between CICERO and CATALINE, which<lb facs="P37_TL00054"/>ended in the utter discomfiture of the latter. It was in the Capitol—and 1 would venture<lb facs="P37_TL00055"/>to say in the pronaos, otherwise the prodomus of the temple, enclosed by marble screens<lb facs="P37_TL00056"/>and thick set with statues, that of POMPEY among others—that the mighty JULIUS fell.<lb facs="P37_TL00057"/>But neither this nor the houses or palaces of BRUTUS and C/ESAR can be fairly described<lb facs="P37_TL00058"/>without drawings.

Of Shakespeare's thirty seven plays twenty<lb facs="P41_TL00024"/>six are acted now and again ; eight to ten quite often, and a very few regularly. It is seldom<lb facs="P41_TL00025"/>that London is without one or even two such revivals. But there is no theatre in England<lb facs="P41_TL00026"/>in which his plays are to be heard all the year round. &amp; &amp; jg? &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P41_TL00027"/>&amp; A foreigner coming to England after his first glance at London naturally asks where he<lb facs="P41_TL00028"/>can see a true English interpretation of the great English Dramatist. No one is able to<lb facs="P41_TL00029"/>inform him. The productions of Shakespeare are fitful, and their style is not any more<lb facs="P41_TL00030"/>English than German, or American. In short, there is no Shakespersan style; and<lb facs="P41_TL00031"/>the nearest approach to this, (though we are not happy to admit it) is the " resurrection "<lb facs="P41_TL00032"/>style attempted by Mr William „Poel, which purposes to place the productions on the stage<lb facs="P41_TL00033"/>in the same manner as they were presented in Shakespeare's lifetime.<lb facs="P41_TL00034"/>To a foreigner this can only suggest a stage of stagnation. He looks for some decided<lb facs="P41_TL00035"/>yet nobly restrained development based upon the principles hinted at by Shakespeare, but<lb facs="P41_TL00036"/>he does not expect to appreciate the undeveloped amateurism of the resurrectionists. He<lb facs="P41_TL00037"/>returns to his country and tells them that in England Shakespeare is not seriously treated<lb facs="P41_TL00038"/>on the stage, that the National Drama does not flourish, and the result is that Germany<lb facs="P41_TL00039"/>annexes our Drama.<lb facs="P41_TL00040"/>&amp; In 1897 no fewer than nine hundred and thirty performances were given in Germany of<lb facs="P41_TL00041"/>twenty four plays by Shakespeare. In 1898 performances of twenty eight plays reached a<lb facs="P41_TL00042"/>total of eight hundred and ninety five, an average of nearly three Shakespearean represen<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

" &amp;<lb facs="P41_TL00044"/>And the mere performance of these plays is not the only way in which this spirited<lb facs="P41_TL00045"/>land aims to make up the deficiency which England has created. Germany attempts to<lb facs="P41_TL00046"/>win the first place in its manner of representing Shakespeare. To this end it treats the<lb facs="P41_TL00047"/>whole question of " production" as seriously as though life and death depended on it.<lb facs="P41_TL00048"/>Patrons are all eager to assist, artists to advise and the theatres to carry out each and<lb facs="P41_TL00049"/>every idea at all original. In this it over-reaches the main object which is to attempt to<lb facs="P41_TL00050"/>produce these Dramas in the most Shakespearean manner, that is, in the most Imaginative<lb facs="P41_TL00051"/>or Poetical way. &amp; &amp; &amp;</ab>

                                       <lb facs="P43_TL00028"/>nal or municipal, should recognize the fact that the theatre, as an institution, exerts<lb facs="P43_TL00029"/>a ceaseless and powerful influence for or against the public good. Instituted upon a<lb facs="P43_TL00030"/>basis of private commercial speculation, the theatre tends, I think, naturally to exert<lb facs="P43_TL00031"/>influences against the public good. The incentives of Its artists, as such, are Inevitably<lb facs="P43_TL00032"/>opposed to the incentives of Its controlling directors, as such. For the former, by<lb facs="P43_TL00033"/>self-interest, desire to lead public taste toward higher standards; whereas the latter,<lb facs="P43_TL00034"/>by self-interest, desire to cater to public taste according to existing standards what<lb facs="P43_TL00035"/>ever they happen to be. Therefore, I believe that every civilized community should<lb facs="P43_TL00036"/>take steps to change the basis of the theatre as an institution from Its prevailing<lb facs="P43_TL00037"/>basis of private speculation for money profit to some basis which shall completely<lb facs="P43_TL00038"/>harmonize the incentives of its artists and its controlling directors. Such should be<lb facs="P43_TL00039"/>the basis of a National Theatre. The first essential of such a theatre is, I think,<lb facs="P43_TL00040"/>absolute financial independence.

My experience does not enable me to answer.<lb facs="P43_TL00050"/>111. The alternative suggested should be avoided by an enlightened state. The state should<lb facs="P43_TL00051"/>seek its own advantage by so organizing the institution of the theatre as to<lb facs="P43_TL00052"/>attract and support the co-operative efforts of the most talented artists.<lb facs="P43_TL00053"/>IV. Doubtless it is true that all co-operative Institutions of art tend to become sluggish<lb facs="P43_TL00054"/>through routine. This tendency however, is perennially checked by the schism of<lb facs="P43_TL00055"/>Individual artists, who revolt from academic restraint, leaven the people with their<lb facs="P43_TL00056"/>special genius, and so, by reflex, reinvigorate the supply of the co-operative insti<lb facs="P43_TL00057"/>tutfon.

In France, the Theatre Antoine would lack its vital<lb facs="P44_TL00004"/>significance but for the existence of the Theatre Thus the chief function<lb facs="P44_TL00005"/>of a National Theatre is the assertion, by achievement, of standards, which may be<lb facs="P44_TL00006"/>challenged and corrected only by the counter-achievement of great artists. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P44_TL00007"/>My answer, then, to this question, is this: I would have voted to have the state<lb facs="P44_TL00008"/>support the artists named through the National Theatres named. The fact that no<lb facs="P44_TL00009"/>English National Theatre existed to support Henry Irving is an artistic indictment of<lb facs="P44_TL00010"/>England, not of a National Theatre per se. &amp;</ab>

The reason that all artists become more or less idiots (in the strict sense of the<lb facs="P44_TL00013"/>word) is that they so seldom get that discipline In convincing and considering<lb facs="P44_TL00014"/>other people that a committee affords.

                                       <lb facs="P44_TL00015"/>liant talents that have been thrown away for want of this social training.<lb facs="P44_TL00016"/>11. In the National Theatres, of course. The National Theatres are but a small percentage<lb facs="P44_TL00017"/>of all the theatres, and a slightly larger percentage of the greatest talent Is enough<lb facs="P44_TL00018"/>to give them the superiority. But it must be borne in mind that under our commer<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                       <lb facs="P44_TL00019"/>cial system no actor who can fill a theatre and manage a theatre for himself is likely<lb facs="P44_TL00020"/>to stay in a National Theatre. Coquelin and Sarah Bernhardt left the but not for<lb facs="P44_TL00021"/>artistic reasons. Irving would probably have left an English National Theatre. But the<lb facs="P44_TL00022"/>superiority remains with the National and quasi National Theatres, including the<lb facs="P44_TL00023"/>Opera houses. " The greatest talent " does not include the highest genius, which,<lb facs="P44_TL00024"/>as in Wagner's case, can hardly expect an official organ for its revolutionary workc<lb facs="P44_TL00025"/>111. The two things are not alternative: why should not the State do both ? In France<lb facs="P44_TL00026"/>not only is the subsidized ; but M. Lugne Poe enjoys a State subsidy for<lb facs="P44_TL00027"/>his enterprise called L' Oeuvre. That would be impossible If the State had not already<lb facs="P44_TL00028"/>begun with what is virtually a National Theatre, and discovered the limitations of<lb facs="P44_TL00029"/>that method. Not until we have a National Theatre in England will it be possible to<lb facs="P44_TL00030"/>get, as an extension of this principle, a subsidy for an individual dramatic artist.<lb facs="P44_TL00031"/>IV. I should have voted for the State doing both. If Irving had had State support and<lb facs="P44_TL00032"/>public responsibility, he could have done work that a concurrent National Theatre<lb facs="P44_TL00033"/>would not have done; and he would at the same time have been compelled by the<lb facs="P44_TL00034"/>example of the National Theatre to treat the works of Shakespeare with some respect.<lb facs="P44_TL00035"/>As it was; the only thing the State did for him was to prevent him from producing<lb facs="P44_TL00036"/>plays of which the heroes were Mahomet and Robert Emmett. A conditional subsidy<lb facs="P44_TL00037"/>might have saved him. Even a committee might have saved him. It was his appalling<lb facs="P44_TL00038"/>isolation, his attempt to live on himself and by himself alone, that led to the downfall<lb facs="P44_TL00039"/>of his theatre. Anything is better for an artist than the solitary despotism of his<lb facs="P44_TL00040"/>own temperament.<lb facs="P44_TL00041"/>Sir H. Beerbohm Tree &amp; London.<lb facs="P44_TL00042"/>I. It is good to have a National Theatre so that the Classical repertory may be preserved,<lb facs="P44_TL00043"/>It is also a recognition of the art of the theatre and therefore desirable. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P44_TL00044"/>11. The most vital art springs, I think, from individual effort.<lb facs="P44_TL00045"/>111. Individual artists of outstanding powers rise superior to and independent of the<lb facs="P44_TL00046"/>trammels and shackles of Committees. &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P44_TL00047"/>IV.

But it is a<lb facs="P45_TL00031"/>result of long training under perfect masters. And the same thing would be the case<lb facs="P45_TL00032"/>if the stage director of this theatre were to obtain control of, let us say, the Royal<lb facs="P45_TL00033"/>Opera in Paris. But he would have to be given a free hand for fifteen years. These<lb facs="P45_TL00034"/>things cannot be done in a hurry at the twelfth hour.

The State, like everything else, has itself to support. It rests with itself to decide<lb facs="P45_TL00045"/>whether a noble and non-commercial Theatre is more beneficial to its health than a<lb facs="P45_TL00046"/>degraded and mony-making Theatre; and the difficult task it sets itself is to discern<lb facs="P45_TL00047"/>the difference between a noble Theatre and a claptrap Theatre. The latter class of<lb facs="P45_TL00048"/>Theatre can be observed any day from the comfortable seat of a hansome cab if the<lb facs="P45_TL00049"/>driver is directed to go down Shaftesbury Avenue, the Haymarket, turn down to St<lb facs="P45_TL00050"/>James' Palace, back through Pall Mall into St Martin's Lane and turn down the Strand.<lb facs="P45_TL00051"/>The non-commercial Theatre must be imagined.

                                       <lb facs="P46_TL00002"/>ment. And I am sure that if the matter of a State-aided Theatre could be weighed<lb facs="P46_TL00003"/>impartially, and all things relating to it judged with justice, we should have as good<lb facs="P46_TL00004"/>State Theatres as State Ships and State Laws. But it has been well said that Art<lb facs="P46_TL00005"/>takes long to learn and that life is very short, and we have learnt that the whole<lb facs="P46_TL00006"/>lifetime of the artist given up unselfishly to the study of a single art is not too Song<lb facs="P46_TL00007"/>a time in which to learn some of its most profound truths. It is therefore difficult to<lb facs="P46_TL00008"/>see how holders of the State offices can be expected to devote the same amount of<lb facs="P46_TL00009"/>time to study this art so as to have the requisite knowledge of what kind of theatre<lb facs="P46_TL00010"/>a State Theatre should be. If the State decides to interest itself in such matters it<lb facs="P46_TL00011"/>seems to me that its representatives should first carefully consider the conclusions<lb facs="P46_TL00012"/>arrived at by the most single-minded professors of the Art of the Theatre. And it is in<lb facs="P46_TL00013"/>selecting advisers.... these most single-minded professors... from the Theatrical Profession<lb facs="P46_TL00014"/>that their greatest difficulty lies. Should they choose aas adviser one who has worked all<lb facs="P46_TL00015"/>his life for popularity they will be courting a danger which must be obvious to all who<lb facs="P46_TL00016"/>have studied the Rise and Fall of the Theatre of the Roman Empire. If they decide to<lb facs="P46_TL00017"/>accept the advice of an actor or actress they run even greater risks. Neither can an<lb facs="P46_TL00018"/>enthusiastic student of the antique theatre be of assistance to them for he confuses<lb facs="P46_TL00019"/>yesterday with today. And a Theatrical Business Director would be unthinkable as an<lb facs="P46_TL00020"/>adviser. Those who could give the best advice are often the last to be consulted. They<lb facs="P46_TL00021"/>are the few independent thinkers in the European Theatre. They may be Russians,<lb facs="P46_TL00022"/>Italians, English or Hungarians; it matters but little what nationality they are; they<lb facs="P46_TL00023"/>are faithful sons of the Theatre who have not wasted the talent with which they were<lb facs="P46_TL00024"/>entrusted. In my opinion it is these men who if possible should be invited to tell the<lb facs="P46_TL00025"/>State the result of their experience, for they look towards the future of the Theatre<lb facs="P46_TL00026"/>with grave eves, neither hopeless of its present unstable condition, nor indifferent as<lb facs="P46_TL00027"/>to its mighty past. There are such men in Moscow; there is one in Budapest; one in<lb facs="P46_TL00028"/>Holland, one In America, and possibly one or more in England. Most of these men are<lb facs="P46_TL00029"/>the stage managers of the first Theatres of their country, and it is due to the fact of<lb facs="P46_TL00030"/>their having served for many years in the position of stage manager which in my opi<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                       <lb facs="P46_TL00031"/>nion entitles them to speak with authority on this matter. If they were great dramatic<lb facs="P46_TL00032"/>poets they might be less provided with the necessary experience; if they were great<lb facs="P46_TL00033"/>actors they would be prejudiced ; but being stage directors as well as men of conside<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The Stage-manager, provided he is an<lb facs="P46_TL00036"/>artist and a serious thinker, is the only man of the Theatre who is unable to find a<lb facs="P46_TL00037"/>preference for any one member of this family. He regards all alike. He anticipates<lb facs="P46_TL00038"/>the future; he is far sighted ; he knows that the Theatre cannot continue long mas<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

If starting from the point of view of the individual artist, few will be found to regard the<lb facs="P48_TL00010"/>system of the official theatre as a sympathetic or desirable one. National Theatres<lb facs="P48_TL00011"/>have everywhere their inherent limits in tradition and convention and in this way<lb facs="P48_TL00012"/>they are handicapped. But on the other hand, (and this must be distinctly understood)<lb facs="P48_TL00013"/>great artists such as Rachel always break down even traditions, and a National Theatre<lb facs="P48_TL00014"/>ean always renew itself by the very talent of its great artists. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P48_TL00015"/>11. The practise of the last thirty years differs materially from that of earlier times.<lb facs="P48_TL00016"/>Formerly In France or Germany the most prominent actors and actresses were intent<lb facs="P48_TL00017"/>on obtaining an engagement in the National Theatre. The change noticed In our days<lb facs="P48_TL00018"/>must be attributed to both artistic and material reasons. Theatres of private enters<lb facs="P48_TL00019"/>prise of our time are intent on securing the greatest artists, wand at prices beyond the<lb facs="P48_TL00020"/>power of National Theatres. Nevertheless Mr. Kainz, the greatest of German actors,<lb facs="P48_TL00021"/>is in Vienna at the Bourgtheater.<lb facs="P48_TL00022"/>111. I have no doubt whatever that independent efforts of individual actors of great talent<lb facs="P48_TL00023"/>are always successful, materially and artistically, without any support from the State<lb facs="P48_TL00024"/>or Nation. 1 find a Committee as in France unnecessary; a manager, a man of artistic<lb facs="P48_TL00025"/>sense and experience, will suffice and there Is no reason to talk about a " less talented"<lb facs="P48_TL00026"/>body when the Comedie can boast of the advantage of retaining Mounet<lb facs="P48_TL00027"/>Sully, Frandy and Mme Bartet after having lost Madame Bernhardt and Coquelin. In=<lb facs="P48_TL00028"/>dependent artistic efforts (I do not mean actors here) should be supported by the<lb facs="P48_TL00029"/>State.<lb facs="P48_TL00030"/>IV. As far as 1 know Mme. Duse and Slgnor Salvini never did consider support of that<lb facs="P48_TL00031"/>kind, because their individual efforts had been very successful. I believe a National<lb facs="P48_TL00032"/>Theatre according to the ideas of Heinrich Laube, the ancient manager of the Burgtheater<lb facs="P48_TL00033"/>in Vienna, is a thing to be desired in every land with all one's heart. Laube's proposal<lb facs="P48_TL00034"/>was to create a classical repertory of international character,... a school for dramatic<lb facs="P48_TL00035"/>literature and good taste, a house of culture and not of business. Perhaps lam very<lb facs="P48_TL00036"/>partial to the idea of the National Theatre, for in Hungary, for instance, our National<lb facs="P48_TL00037"/>Theatre was for the space of forty years the one only stage devoted to the purposes<lb facs="P48_TL00038"/>of art, and it holds at this moment, with some few exceptions, the greatest artists to<lb facs="P48_TL00039"/>be found on the entire Hungarian stage. &amp; &amp; &amp;</ab>

The mere establishment of a Theatre subsidised by the state would, it seems to me,<lb facs="P48_TL00042"/>be of little benefit to the Artists; but if in addition to a Theatre the Government were<lb facs="P48_TL00043"/>to lie aside a sum of money for the publication of serious works relating to Theatrical<lb facs="P48_TL00044"/>History, Literature and Art, so as to facilitate and assist the stage artist in his studies<lb facs="P48_TL00045"/>of those subjects, it would be of the highest value and advantage to the Art of the<lb facs="P48_TL00046"/>Theatre, since it would have the effect of sending more serious, thoughtful and better<lb facs="P48_TL00047"/>equipped men to the work.<lb facs="P48_TL00048"/>11. The greatest stage talent is in neither one nor the other, though possibly at times con«<lb facs="P48_TL00049"/>nected with both. "All that glitters is not gold" and stars may seem brilliant and yet<lb facs="P48_TL00050"/>dead. When private enterprise creates the theatres controlled by Mr Prohman it<lb facs="P48_TL00051"/>indulges in a collection of these extinct stars. Mr Frohman is, of course, only a pirate<lb facs="P48_TL00052"/>on the high seas of an inartistic world, and the harm he does tells only against a<lb facs="P48_TL00053"/>foolish group of timid London managers. Still if, the State intends to construct it should<lb facs="P48_TL00054"/>also take care to destroy. It should destroy Mr Prohman, close half the Music Halls,<lb facs="P48_TL00055"/>and attempt the reform of some of our home-grown managers. &amp; J£&gt; &amp;</ab>

The Kembles and their grand artificiality had to<lb facs="P52_TL00048"/>make room for Edmund Kean, who in thirty years from then was looked on as anything<lb facs="P52_TL00049"/>but natural, for was not Macready " more natural ", and in a few years time all of these<lb facs="P52_TL00050"/>actors seemed to us stilted and artificial when Henry Irving appeared. And now we talk<lb facs="P52_TL00051"/>of Irving's artificiality by the side of Antoine's natural acting; "it is nature itself "<lb facs="P52_TL00052"/>cry the critics, and soon Antoine's natural acting is to become mere artifice by the side of<lb facs="P52_TL00053"/>the acting of Stanislawsky.

Evelyn saw the Piazza as it is shown here if we omit the temporary Teatro. In this Teatro we see a “ Barriera ” being performed on a scale worthy of a great city. The inventer of the Teatro and the big ship seen in the right hand corner was Francesco Guitti of Ferrara who also invented some of the songs. This same Guitti invented for the Carnival in Ferrara (1638) a stage with an interesting arrangement op steps leading down to the floor of the auditorium. See Hammitzsch. pg. 35 for reproduction of copper plate showing the arrangement. EXPLANATION OF THE ABOVE PLATE: A. &amp; B. TWO ENTRANCES OF TEATRO. H. TROOP OF EGYPTIANS. Q.

The French Theatre will not protest when we<lb facs="P11_TL00009"/>remind it that Shakespeare (though exiled by us) is still a member of<lb facs="P11_TL00010"/>our Theatre, and a name we use to conjure with.<lb facs="P11_TL00011"/>WHILE the Russian, German and Italian Theatres cannot show<lb facs="P11_TL00012"/>a star of such magnitude and brilliance as Shakespeare or<lb facs="P11_TL00013"/>Moliere, they are today taking more forward positions than those to<lb facs="P11_TL00014"/>which the French and English manipulators are happy to see their<lb facs="P11_TL00015"/>two theatres relegated.<lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>The Russians, Germans and Italians use the best brains of their<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>Theatres*<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>The American Theatre is awake to possibilities.<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>THE English Theatre concerns us most.

It continues to allow the same<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>old underhand manipulators of the last forty years to muddle things.<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>Its critics, if old, mutter the same contented platitudes; if young, a five<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>years course of the underhand Professionalism soon brings them to toe<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>the line and mumble what they are told to mumble.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P35_TL00072"/>(n) Passing over ihe whole of the sixteenth century,<lb facs="P35_TL00073"/>we find another experiment, also in the open air, at the<lb facs="P35_TL00074"/>beginning of the following century. In fact, while Riario's<lb facs="P35_TL00075"/>music, sung in the open air or in an enclosed place, had a<lb facs="P35_TL00076"/>scenic setting, this second one has for theatre a car which<lb facs="P35_TL00077"/>moves from one piazza to another. The invention is due<lb facs="P35_TL00078"/>to Pietro Delia Valle, a celebrated traveller, artist and<lb facs="P35_TL00079"/>man of learning, and perhaps also the author of the poem,<lb facs="P35_TL00080"/>who in his well known letter of the 16th January 1640<lb facs="P35_TL00081"/>to Lelio Guidiccioni speaks in the following terms of the<lb facs="P35_TL00082"/>musical composition, the work of Paolo Quagliati, and of<lb facs="P35_TL00083"/>the performance given of it in the Carnival of 1606;<lb facs="P35_TL00084"/>" And in regard to the music of my Car composed<lb facs="P35_TL00085"/>by Quagliati for the most part in my room, according as<lb facs="P35_TL00086"/>he saw it pleased me, with which I went out in mask in<lb facs="P35_TL00087"/>the Carnival of the year 1606. And it was one of the<lb facs="P35_TL00088"/>first actions (so to speak) performed in music to be heard<lb facs="P35_TL00089"/>in Rome. Although there did not take part more than five<lb facs="P35_TL00090"/>voices and five instruments, just so many as, in a moving<lb facs="P35_TL00091"/>choir, could have place, they did not for this reason sing<lb facs="P35_TL00092"/>only one at a time, but the personages sang now alone, now<lb facs="P35_TL00093"/>two together, now three, and, at the end, five, which pro<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

And he goes on to declare that<lb facs="P71_TL00053"/>he, the artist, to whom the work was more important<lb facs="P71_TL00054"/>than the pay, is the practical man.

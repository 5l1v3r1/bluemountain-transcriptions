The original drawing in pen and ink was and is preserved at the Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington. Numbered 2266, It is attributed to the Galli Family (ie: Bibiena). It is from the Collection of Sir Thomas Lawrence R. A, We should not say it was by any of the Family Galli, but rather by some one later: possibly Gonzaga (1750 ? – 1831). Compare with Tav.

                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00002"/>interesting phase of the theatre it has ever had,<lb facs="P9_TL00003"/>and in Birmingham and elsewhere it is still<lb facs="P9_TL00004"/>alive. But I fancy that, moving with the times, the<lb facs="P9_TL00005"/>present repertory theatres are a little shy of the<lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>modern prose play.<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>* It is no new experience for the author to<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>be slighted. I read the other day a story by<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>Mr. Booth Tarkington about a play which was<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>conceived and written as a study in egoism.<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>The great actor who was to play the chief<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>part, however, preferred nobility, and so the part<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>became nobler and nobler till it was completely<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>turned round. The author was told that he was<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>quite mistaken in imagining that what he had<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>written was a play. " A play isn't something<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>you read; it's something actors do on a stage;<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>and they can't afford to do it unless the public<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>pays to watch 'em. If it won't buy tickets<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>you haven't got a play; you've only got some<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>typewriting ". There we are! Our efforts are<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>reduced to some typewriting. Mr Tarkington's<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>actor thought, too, that he would like to play<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>St. Paul in silver armour: " Play it as a spi<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Evidently he<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>had the notion. St. Paul in silver armour,<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>clearly, is not representational, not realistic. Yet<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>Mr. Tarkington, whose tale was written a de<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>cade ago, appears to think that the phase he<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>describes is obsolete. The difference is that<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>the actor-manager he describes was a blatant<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>creature whom we may scorn; the later enemy<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>to the literary dramatist's peace is a cultivated<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>man with all the arts at his finger-ends and the<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>proportions all right.

Some<lb facs="P10_TL00089"/>of the repertory producers were almost touchingly<lb facs="P10_TL00090"/>reverential towards the dramatist's scrip; but<lb facs="P10_TL00091"/>how is it to be with the super-producer?

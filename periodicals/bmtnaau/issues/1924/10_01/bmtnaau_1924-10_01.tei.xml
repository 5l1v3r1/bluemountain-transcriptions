It puzzles me often,<lb facs="P14_TL00006"/>as 1 wonder what possessed him to leave<lb facs="P14_TL00007"/>the post of Master of the Revels in the<lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>hands of any but a well-travelled man ;<lb facs="P14_TL00009"/>such a man as Evelyn, for example.<lb facs="P14_TL00010"/>For a born traveler will linger in cities<lb facs="P14_TL00011"/>seeing the best that is to be seen, and<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>understanding it.

I can then see Evelyn being sent<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>to pay another visit to Italy, to look for<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>some artists who might come to London,<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>while our English artists were invited to<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>Venice. <lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>I can see this because I am blind.<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>But some one touches me on the shoulder<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>as I write, and my pen slows down.

I always had a certain faith in the opera, that,<lb facs="P24_TL00027"/>out of it as out of the Choruses of the ancient festival of<lb facs="P24_TL00028"/>Bacchus, tragedy would develope into a nobler form. In<lb facs="P24_TL00029"/>the opera one really does drop those servile imitations of<lb facs="P24_TL00030"/>nature, and—even though it were only under the name<lb facs="P24_TL00031"/>of indulgence—the ideal might in this manner steal its<lb facs="P24_TL00032"/>way on to the stage.

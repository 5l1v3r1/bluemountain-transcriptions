The Mask, by the way, is a quite remarkable,<lb facs="P3_TL00017"/>revolutionary magazine, which, unlike any purely theatrical magazine that 1 can<lb facs="P3_TL00018"/>recollect, is rich in intelligence, eager discussion of theatrical affairs, treating drama<lb facs="P3_TL00019"/>and the stage seriously as great matters of art, and striking fiercely against the idea<lb facs="P3_TL00020"/>that a playhouse should be a mere place of entertainment."

The Athenian eunuch was also dismissed with a rebuff, and, it seems, has founded<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>a " Classical " Music Hall, (le nu esthetique) in Paris. &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>There remained only a small group of artisans with the carpenter Peter Quince and<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>the weaver Nick Bottom at their head. These simple fellows falling on their knees before<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>the master of the revels, avowed in compunction of having dared with their coarse red<lb facs="P9_TL00042"/>hands, to bring a gift to the Gracious Reigning Duke, and that they were desirous of<lb facs="P9_TL00043"/>presenting it in person at the feet of his majesty. This gift was " A tedious brief scene of<lb facs="P9_TL00044"/>young Pyramus and his love Thisbe: very tragical mirth! Merry and tragical!" Philostrate<lb facs="P9_TL00045"/>shook his head,... but being mollified with a purse of coppers, notified the duke of the matter.<lb facs="P9_TL00046"/>The good duke (whose name be famous in all ages) uttered these winged words; &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00047"/>"....I will hear that play;<lb facs="P9_TL00048"/>For never anything can be amiss,<lb facs="P9_TL00049"/>When simpleness and duty tender it,"<lb facs="P9_TL00050"/>The Sun God heard these words and, seized with a terrible anger, turned back, seating<lb facs="P9_TL00051"/>himself as quickly as possible in his air chariot, and as he rose above the roof of the palace<lb facs="P9_TL00052"/>shot an arrow from a silver bow, which, sticking into Mr. Nick's nose, caused his noble<lb facs="P9_TL00053"/>cheeks to run with blood. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00054"/>&amp; Apollo's disappearance was so sudden and unexpected, that the court panegyrist had not<lb facs="P9_TL00055"/>succeeded in writing the hymn in honour of the setting sun on the duke's wedding day. The<lb facs="P9_TL00056"/>offended God never returned, although the sun always shone over Acropolis, although little<lb facs="P9_TL00057"/>children heard in their dreams the mysterious sounds of his lyre. &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P10_TL00003"/>&amp; In the meantime the highly respected carpenter Peter Quince and the enlightened weaver<lb facs="P10_TL00004"/>Nick Bottom, putting on one side their ill-paid trades, fell into the embraces of the kind<lb facs="P10_TL00005"/>Muses. Having sold their tools they bought, at second-hand shops, styles, wax tablets,<lb facs="P10_TL00006"/>buskins and masks. An agreeable accord reigned between the two ex-artisans: Quince wrote<lb facs="P10_TL00007"/>that which Bottom wanted, Bottom played that which Quince desired; but always it was Quince<lb facs="P10_TL00008"/>who obeyed Bottom, this latter, in fact, distinguishing himself for his presence of mind and<lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>cunning. At first these performances took place in the " enchanted wood near Athens "<lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>before a small group of spectators, composed for the greater part of old mates. As however<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>mischievous Puck never ceased playing his pranks on the passionate " part devourers," and<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>as the fair beholders, rather with clownish laughs than in oboles, paid for the touching<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>spectacle, it was decided to remove to Athens. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>And thus it happened that, in a short time after the duke's wedding feast, a new<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>theatre was erected in Athens under the patronage of Apollo. The architecture of the<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>building cleverly united the temple with a lupanar.

The advertisement for the night (which long remained engraven on the minds<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>of the spectators) announced the beautifully written tragedy of Prof. L. Anneus Seneca,<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>under the title of " Frantic Hercules " composed according to the sacred law of Stagyrite's<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>poetics. The performance was preceded by a " conference " by M. Georges de Scudery governor<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>of Notre Dame de la Garde, likewise the ornament of the Hotel de Rambouillet's drawing<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>rooms. The distinguished esthete highly praised the " agreeable beauties " of the classical<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>drama, referring his hearers to the XX chapter of Aristotle's Poetics, to the X chapter<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>of Plato's Republic, to the VI chapter of Heinsius' treatise on the disposition of tragedy etc,<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>etc. At the end a fairy ballet was given under the title of " Titania ".... in the apotheosis,<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>amidst the lights of Bengal fires, the Fairy Queen herself appeared, in flesh-coloured tights,<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>rouged, and wearing a crown cut out of gold paper. " Several thousand people were turned<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>away from the ticket office " note the chroniclers. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>The theatre prospered. On the repeated demands of the public, whose hands were swollen<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>from the continual applauding of the authors and actors, the management resolved upon<lb facs="P10_TL00044"/>fixed " claps ", thus enabling the spectators to express their enthusiasm in a less painful<lb facs="P10_TL00045"/>manner, and even, from time to time, permitting them to doze in the comfortable dusty seats.<lb facs="P10_TL00046"/>&amp; The theatre prospered. Mr. Quince wrote, altered, shaped, localised, and in this occupation<lb facs="P10_TL00047"/>his cast-off trade came in useful more than once. Mr. Bottom was always at his beck and<lb facs="P10_TL00048"/>call with his enlightened advice and played.... played everything. He was a real virtuoso.<lb facs="P10_TL00049"/>With his capability for transformation and his everlasting youth he surpassed in the opinion<lb facs="P10_TL00050"/>of some the Divine Sarah.

About noon anchor was dropped on the shores of an island, which,<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>so Ariel informed them, was governed by his master, the good Magus Prospero. &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>And a strange island it was, abounding in extravagant trees bearing fruit larger than<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>that which the emissaries of Moses brought from Canaan, as is painted in Bibles for children.<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>And a strange island it was, abounding in variegated-winged birds, able to sing so softly,<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>so beautifully and so movingly, like ancient musical clocks which are the suns in the grey<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>rooms of old women. A strange island it was, abounding in people conversing in rhyme<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>with the sun, with the sea, and with the flowers in the likeness of those beautiful sick at<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>heart, imprisoned in closed gardens. &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>The astonished and childishly delighted wanderers were invited by King Prospero to a<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>feast, which he himself had prepared in his magic laboratory.

Into crystal<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>goblets Ariel poured, from sapphire ewers encrusted with minute golden stones, which in<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>a mysterious way depicted the chart of the starry sphere unknown to the inhabitants of<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>the real world, the beverage extracted from poppies. From this chart, as it were from holy<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>runes, the very strange host deciphered wise and inebriating sentences. &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>&amp; "And now that I have shown your Excellencies all the wonders of this island" said<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>Prospero, " I make so bold as to invite you to my theatre.

                                    <lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>Timon of Athens is one of those plays which is so far a<lb facs="P14_TL00009"/>doubtful or at least a patched work, that one need not be<lb facs="P14_TL00010"/>ultra-conservative in the matter of stage directions. Thus I<lb facs="P14_TL00011"/>have no hesitation in uniting the first, second and third<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>Scenes of the third Act into one external or street scene,<lb facs="P14_TL00013"/>the first and third Scenes being enacted at the thresholds<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>of the houses of Lucullus and Senipronius. The fifth Scene<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>might be omitted altogether; it has nothing to do with<lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>Shakspere, and certainly nothing to do with the plot. The<lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>short first Scene of the second Act may also very well be<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>omitted in stage representation. If further we make the<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>" room of state " of the second Scene of the first Act the<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>same as the " magnificent room " in the last Scene of the<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>third Act, we shall have the architectural scenery reduced<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>to the following list:— &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>1. A hall in Timon's house.<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>2. A room of state in Timon's house.<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>3. A public place.<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>4. Without the walls of Athens.</ab>

There might have been merely a wall or a<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>wall with colonnade towards the street and several entrances<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>leading from it to the court or prothyron.

                                 <ab facs="P14_TB00010">
                                    <lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>doubtless, have his residence built in the best possible way, so we may fairly conclude that<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>it was constructed of Pentelic marble, that its walls were covered with imagery, that its doors<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>were clothed with costly metals and ivory, in a word, that it was exceptionally magnificent,<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>and nearly, if not quite, as sumptuous as the palace of king Leontes in Sicily. In the banquet<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>scene the guests would recline on couches, for although the men of Homer's time and the<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>Dorians of Crete always sat, the Athenian had learnt to eat in a reclining posture long<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>before the time of Timon. One couch held, as a rule, only two guests (1) and had a separate<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>table provided for it. Upon these couches were heaped goat skins, carpets, and cushions,<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>so as to make them not merely comfortable but luxurious. The dinner, when of the most<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>recherche description, consisted of soup, boiled fish, poultry, and meat, piled up on the<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>tables; these done with the tables were removed, then followed the finger glasses of the<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>period, plaited chaplets of flowers for the heads of the guests, and perfumes handed round<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>by firm limbed girls; last of all, the loving cup passed round to the sound of music, and<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>then were brought in clean or fresh tables piled with fruit baked cakes, and toasted sweetmeats.<lb facs="P14_TL00051"/>jZ? Leaving Timon and his friends over their wine and water we pass into the street, and find<lb facs="P14_TL00052"/>that a public way in Athens was not very unlike what it was in Sicily. Of the walls of<lb facs="P14_TL00053"/>Themistocles and of the gates nothing remains, and any attempted restoration of them must<lb facs="P14_TL00054"/>be in great part conjectural. We are told that they were sixty feet high. There are<lb facs="P14_TL00055"/>remains of foundations at Pass turn and other places to show us how thick these Greek<lb facs="P14_TL00056"/>fortifications sometimes were and how they were constructed. That there were square<lb facs="P14_TL00057"/>towers and battlements and loopholes may also be received as tolerably certain. We may<lb facs="P14_TL00058"/>almost take it for granted that the gateway was square-headed, and that the masonry</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P15_TB00002">
                                    <lb facs="P15_TL00002"/>was massive and regular, but if we wish to go further than this, restoration must be<lb facs="P15_TL00003"/>supplemented by design. ds? &amp; &amp; jg? &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00004"/>And now turning to the costume of B. C. 430=407. I confess lam troubled; not for want<lb facs="P15_TL00005"/>of authorities but through excess of them. On marble, vase, coin, and gem are the illustrations<lb facs="P15_TL00006"/>which the old Greek has left us of the written word. This last tells us of women decked<lb facs="P15_TL00007"/>out in the feminine yellow or saffron-coloured chitons over loose Cimmerian transparent<lb facs="P15_TL00008"/>chemises, or chitonians of fine linen, with girdles round the waist, and sandles on the feet.<lb facs="P15_TL00009"/>An outer garment and a cloak, or himation, was worn over the chiton, the latter usually<lb facs="P15_TL00010"/>at night and in cold weather. Besides these, mention is made of Persian slippers, veils<lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>(shawl or peplos), parasols, small mirrors suspended from the girdle, rings, necklaces, gold<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>ornaments, paints and unguents for the skin, the head-dress, the head-band, and the caul<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>or net cap worn also at night. We are told of the hair of some women being cut bowl-fashion,<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>of that of others being loose and flowing. As to the men, we learn that they wore a linen<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>shirt, a chiton, girded, shoes, and in winter a cloak and boots, and that they wore the chaplet<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>of flowers received at dinner throughout the evening, although they might be going to other<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>houses. The colours most usually employed were the Tyrian purple, the Sardian red, soft<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>whites, tender greens, and dark blue-greys. <lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>It is somewhat strange that, considering the abundance of illustration in the British<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>Museum alone, a Greek dress has yet to be made; for neither in the numerous (attempted)<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>Classical costumes of the stage, nor in the paintings of Classical subject publicly exhibited<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>has a Greek tunic or chiton been fairly represented. It is quite impossible without the help<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>of drawings to fully explain the different shapes of and modes of wearing this the chief article<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>in a Greek wardrobe; but it may be noted— (1.) that fineness and closeness of texture in the<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>wool is essential; (2.) that fullness of material so as to secure a multitude of folds is equally<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>necessary; (3.) that the gigantic key and wave borders we have been accustomed to see on<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>the English stage have nothing to do with Greek work of the time of Alcibiades; (4.) that the<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>decoration of the dress was effected by double lines and dots arranged vertically in the<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>centre of the front of the chiton as well as by border lines; (5.) that there were sundry kinds<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>of girdles ranging from the simple string tied in a large bow at the front or side to the<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>broad metal zone tied or clasped; and (6.) that there were two distinct kinds of chiton—one<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>single bodied, and the other compound or double bodied (called 5171X0%), which consisted in<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>the chiton being much longer than the person, the extra length being doubled over, and<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>falling over the front and back as low as the waist or lower. Besides these common forms<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>of the chief dress we meet with illustrations of over dresses reaching some distance below<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>the waist, and girded. Some of these have short shaped sleeves, and some have long, loose,<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>or bag sleeves. Another form which has the appearance of a sleeve is nothing more than<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>the upper extensive hem of the chiton dropping over the upper arm, and looped up by one,<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>three, four, five, or six buttons. For the Greek chiton was formed of a square cut piece of<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>wool, and was as broad or broader than it was long. When, therefore, the dress was not looped<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>over the arm, it hung from the shoulder button in an open fold under each arm, through which<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>might, perhaps, occasionally be seen the delicate chemise or vest beneath. The borders were<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>usually enriched with single lines, sometimes dots set close together were added on one or<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>both sides of the line, and in the richest examples double lines occur, the upper band thus<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>formed enclosing embroidered figures—the marginal one decorated with conventional leafage.<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>&amp; Various, too, was the arrangement of the women's hair, as also the designs of their<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>head-dresses. Some of these were extremely beautiful, others, again, look awkward, not<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>to say ugly, if such an objectionable word may be allowed in connection with anything<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>Greek. The bracelets were chiefly of gold, made in the spiral form. Necklets were mostly<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>of beads or pearls, which were also used for the head-dress, for neckchains, and even girdles.<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>The peplos or shawl, and the chlamys or scarf, were worn out of doors. The first of these<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>was a very capacious sort of wrap, and was often used as a cover to choice furniture.<lb facs="P15_TL00053"/>It was usually worn round the body, the end being thrown over one shoulder<lb facs="P15_TL00054"/>and falling to the bottom of the back. The scarf was sometimes made in an oblong piece,<lb facs="P15_TL00055"/>the length equal to twice its width, and sometimes with triangular goars or wings added.<lb facs="P15_TL00056"/>The chiton and chlamys were worn by both sexes. I might go on exhausting the patience<lb facs="P15_TL00057"/>of my readers with descriptions of the different methods of wearing the scarf, and of<lb facs="P15_TL00058"/>many other modes and details of dress, but if anyone is anxious to learn more they have but</ab>

Do you find the idea of the<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>poet in the theatre offensive ? Please say what is the meaning of this extraordinary idea of<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>yours, that that which has been good for hundreds of years is suddenly to be held as bad."<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>It is exceedingly difficult to reply to all this, and as it is exceedingly difficult let us try<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>to do SO. jg? &lt;£&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;/£/<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>&amp; Of course to me the whole question is so clear that it ceases to be a question any longer.<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>5t has become the obvious with me that when man sets his hand to a work he should not<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>take by the wrist another man's hand and use it to do the work in question, and then call<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>it his work. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>The whole thing is so obvious to me that in order to be able to reply carefully and<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>sensibly to those to whom it is not obvious, I must remove myself from the picture before<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>me, and see every line in the pictures which the others see. And if I try to do that I shall<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>have to see some very dull things, and discuss some very dull points, which are obvious<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>to most of us; but if the question has to be gone into at all perhaps this is inevitable. &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>&amp; I have a horrible dread of proving people to be wrong, especially the man who takes<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>the Arts easily. I have more than a large appreciation of his good sense. Besides Ido not<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>want to prove that the man who goes to the pit to see 44 Richard III," is wrong for going<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>there, no matter what his reason is. &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>Let us take the whole front row of the London pit, consisting of twenty people. <lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>Ask them the reason why they have come to the theatre. Five reply, " 1 come to<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>see Mr.... act." Three reply, 44 It is such a great play, I like to hear it so much." Two<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>giggle and reply, " We don't know why we come, but we think it is such fun. " Two<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>are there from a sense of duty both to the actors or the play, and to the audience; and<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>the other eight will give us several elaborate and conflicting reasons for their presence. <lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>&amp; One will say, that it is the extraordinary sense of the impossible, the grim absurdity of<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>the whole thing, which fascinates him (excellent judge!). rz/<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>&amp; The second will tell you that after having spent the day among dull and matter of fact<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>people it is quite interesting to find a body of people who will sit still while actors and<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>scenery are pretending on the stage. &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>&amp; Then there is the third, the critical man; one who having read how Edmond Kean<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>illuminated Shakespeare by sudden flashes of genius, and that the Kemble family were of<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>the 44 classical" school and that Charles Fechter was a romantic actor, and having read a<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>history of the stage which skips over the first couple of thousand years in two pages and only<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>begins to go into detail when it comes to the Shakespearean era, this man will be there,<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>because somehow he feels that the thing would be incomplete without him; he is one of<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>the men who know.... has he not read all about it? &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>&amp; Then next to him is sitting a young lady, who, with the intelligence which is natural in<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>her sex, is ready to see all that is there and more, (or less) if required; and yet indeed she<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>leans towards the 44 more " and is ever the champion of the 44 more " when she finds it. &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>&amp; Next to her sits the grumbler, one who goes to a theatre because he must, and who, 1<lb facs="P17_TL00048"/>believe, is always the one who is most deeply moved by what he sees. Yet when the curtain<lb facs="P17_TL00049"/>is once down he will tell you that was not the way to do it at all. 44 Why," he says, 44the<lb facs="P17_TL00050"/>actors are so many sticks; nothing real about them. " He draws our attention to the flapping<lb facs="P17_TL00051"/>scenery and grumbles about the incidental music which he says spoils the effect; and he<lb facs="P17_TL00052"/>detests all those flashing lights, which, he says, spoil the illusion. But what illusion is<lb facs="P17_TL00053"/>destroyed he is totally unable to define. The rest of the row say that it is very nice<lb facs="P17_TL00054"/>indeed and they all applaud heartily, while he continues to grunt and mumble and keeps<lb facs="P17_TL00055"/>0n repeating that 44 that isn't the way to do it." &amp;</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P18_TB00003">
                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>&amp; And so we see that very nearly each single man or woman is come there for a different<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>purpose, sees the thing in a different light, and composes what we can term an " audience<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>that is to say a single idea; that audience which the actor always looks on as one man, and<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>which we must accept as the " ideal spectator." &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>&amp; One thing is irrefutable. They cannot keep away from the theatre. And another thing<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>which we must admit is this: that out of the twenty, fifteen have come to see something. 1<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>will even go so far as to say that the entire twenty have come to see something; because<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>the first on our list, the first five who came to hear Shakespeare more or less admit that<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>they came to see it performed, for had they wished they could have Joined the many<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>thousands who sit at home and read it silently, and in this way hear it in their mind's<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>ear with all its amazing and wonderful accompaniment; or joined those who read it<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>together in Societies.<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>&amp; So we can say somewhat surely that all have come to see the play. &amp; This<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>desire is as fierce as any in the nature of man. Only when seeing does a man<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>thoroughly believe. There are innumerable proofs of this, and many will occur to you at<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>this moment without my mentioning them. So now; it Is reasonable to ask that that which<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>the people desire and go to the theatre to find, should be given to them.<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>&amp; They go to see something; they should be shown it. Only by showing them<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>will they be satisfied. Therefore I hold that properly to satisfy their eye, and through that<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>their being, we should not confuse them or confuse their sense of sight which is most<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>delicate, by pounding at the same time at their ears with music or with words, nor by<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>attacking their minds with problems and shaking their bodies with passions. &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>&amp; Let us take something as an example of what I mean.... that part in the play of<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>" Macbeth " where he prepares to nerve himself to rob King Duncan of his life. He is roaming<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>about in and out of the dark corridors of his castle. Behind him, like his shadow, a servant<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>moves, they pass and repass a window, and I think I see him gazing out a long time towards<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>the heath. He continues his prowling, and then rests upon a stone bench. The servant<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>holding a trembling light, looks at him, and he looks back again.... Once more he begins to<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>pace the corridor, he is afraid to be left alone. He thinks of his wife, then becomes more<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>afraid of being left quite alone ;..v " Go, bid thy Mistress when my drink is ready she<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>strike upon the bell." The servant departs. He continues to roam up and down. In his<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>agitation the figure of his wife takes the place of his servant. He feels particularly fine;<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>he has an audience; he seems to take courage and his desire warms in him. He will do<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>it.... The servant returns, startling him for an instant.... "Get thee to bed " He watches<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>the flame of the torch as it dwindles and dwindles, down the steps leading to the basement;<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>a flame at first, it now became a streak.... a streak.... &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>" Is this a dagger that I see before me?<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>The handle towards my hand? Come, let me clutch thee;<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.<lb facs="P18_TL00046"/>Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible<lb facs="P18_TL00047"/>To feeling as to sight? or art thou but<lb facs="P18_TL00048"/>A dagger of the mind; a false creation<lb facs="P18_TL00049"/>Proceeding from the heat»oppressed brain.<lb facs="P18_TL00050"/>I see thee yet, in form* as palpable<lb facs="P18_TL00051"/>As that which now I draw.<lb facs="P18_TL00052"/>Thou marshal's! me the way that I was going;<lb facs="P18_TL00053"/>And such an instrument I was to use.<lb facs="P18_TL00054"/>Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,<lb facs="P18_TL00055"/>Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still<lb facs="P18_TL00056"/>And on thy blade, and dudgeon, gouts of blood<lb facs="P18_TL00057"/>Which was not so before. = There's no such thing.<lb facs="P18_TL00058"/>It is the bloody business, which informs<lb facs="P18_TL00059"/>Thus to mine eyes.... Now o'er the one half world<lb facs="P18_TL00060"/>Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse<lb facs="P18_TL00061"/>The curtain'd sleep; now witchcraft celebrates<lb facs="P18_TL00062"/>Pale Hecate's offering; and wither'd murder,<lb facs="P18_TL00063"/>Alarm'd by his sentinel, the wolf,</ab>

This same idea, these same figures, these same visions, can<lb facs="P19_TL00015"/>be better brought before the eye and so into the soul of the audience if the artist<lb facs="P19_TL00016"/>concentrates on that which appeals to the eye, than if that which appeals to the brain, and<lb facs="P19_TL00017"/>that which appeals to the ear is making simultaneous confusion, (i) &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00018"/>&amp; It is difficult to read this one speech of Macbeth slowly, when other sounds and sights<lb facs="P19_TL00019"/>are exterminated and we are quiet in our rooms, and get the full value of what Shakespeare<lb facs="P19_TL00020"/>has put there. We can read the speech three, four or five times, and then only is some of<lb facs="P19_TL00021"/>its worth caught by us. And having read this speech three, four, five times let anyone<lb facs="P19_TL00022"/>continue to read the entire play, and he will be as fatigued as though he had walked<lb facs="P19_TL00023"/>twenty miles. But he will have felt some of that which Shakespeare intended him to<lb facs="P19_TL00024"/>feel, though by no means all. &amp; That which he feels we shall not feel when we go to see<lb facs="P19_TL00025"/>the play performed in the theatres. &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00026"/>When we read those lines we are not cramped within three walls. We wander up to<lb facs="P19_TL00027"/>the top of the Castle with Macbeth, we gaze across the rooky woods and across the hills;<lb facs="P19_TL00028"/>we can descend with him into the cellars, we may pass out and among the bushes which<lb facs="P19_TL00029"/>bank themselves at the foot of the damp castle of Glamis. And if we only went so far with<lb facs="P19_TL00030"/>Shakespeare 1 should not have reason to object to the cramping in between three walls<lb facs="P19_TL00031"/>which we are subjected to in the theatre; for we should not be great losers. But when we<lb facs="P19_TL00032"/>read, we ride with Shakespeare upon the sightless couriers of the air. Pity, like a naked<lb facs="P19_TL00033"/>new born babe, hangs in the air before us; we see the wolf with Tarquin's ravishing<lb facs="P19_TL00034"/>strides passing before us; he seems to prowl round the room, the entire time we are<lb facs="P19_TL00035"/>reading. We hear the bell which strikes and rings the knell at the death of Duncan. As we<lb facs="P19_TL00036"/>sit in our room reading, the bell time after time booms out in the distance. Later,<lb facs="P19_TL00037"/>tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day...."<lb facs="P19_TL00038"/>Round our room, outside the window, above us in the room over our head, creeps continually<lb facs="P19_TL00039"/>the tomorrow and tomorrow, and so losing all this in the Theatre we are great losers. &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00040"/>It is not people and things, but ideas which so surround and possess us as we sit and<lb facs="P19_TL00041"/>read. And when art is so great and so perfect that it can bring us in the mere reading<lb facs="P19_TL00042"/>such priceless magical things, it is little short of sacrilege to destroy that which produces<lb facs="P19_TL00043"/>those ideas by confusing us and our other senses, by appealing to those other senses at the<lb facs="P19_TL00044"/>same time.<lb facs="P19_TL00045"/>How obvious this all should be. And so, although it is absurd to talk hopefully of the<lb facs="P19_TL00046"/>possibility that in a short time these plays may not be put on the stage, I would have them<lb facs="P19_TL00047"/>there but seldom for the reason I have suggested, that on the stage we lose them.<lb facs="P19_TL00048"/>&lt;£? And there is another reason why I would not have them there, and it is this: the<lb facs="P19_TL00049"/>same idea, the same impression the same beauty and philosophy if you wish can be put<lb facs="P19_TL00050"/>before the eyes of an audience without at the same time confusing their ideas through an<lb facs="P19_TL00051"/>appeal to their other senses.<lb facs="P19_TL00052"/>A man, (we may call him Macbeth, though it does not matter what his name is)—may<lb facs="P19_TL00053"/>be seen passing through all these doubts and fears—a figure in action; and round him other<lb facs="P19_TL00054"/>figures in action; and though we may not receive the superb impression which a master</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P20_TB00003">
                                    <lb facs="P20_TL00007"/>(which Shakespeare) gives us, we shall through our eyes receive a clearer impression than<lb facs="P20_TL00008"/>if the other senses were called upon at the same time to " assist", for, instead of assisting,<lb facs="P20_TL00009"/>they would confuse, as they ever do. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00010"/>Suppose we look at a picture by Signorelli, the famous one of the Berlin Gallery. I<lb facs="P20_TL00011"/>fail utterly to believe that a string quartett playing hard at the same time would assist<lb facs="P20_TL00012"/>our eyes; or that some one reciting to us simultaneously the "Birth of Pan " would bring<lb facs="P20_TL00013"/>out the qualities in the picture. It would only confuse. &amp; <lb facs="P20_TL00014"/>&amp; Supposing we are listening to the Pastoral Symphony by Beethoven. I do not believe<lb facs="P20_TL00015"/>that a panorama of hay-makers making hay, or a pleasant voice reading to us from Spenser's<lb facs="P20_TL00016"/>\<lb facs="P20_TL00017"/>" Shepherd's Calender " would add In any way to the understanding or the enjoyment of<lb facs="P20_TL00018"/>those qualities which are in the Symphony. It would only confuse. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00019"/>Has it ever been tried? No, indeed! The musicians have protected their garden well.<lb facs="P20_TL00020"/>The painters have protected theirs well. &amp; The theatre men have left their vineyard, and<lb facs="P20_TL00021"/>it has been annexed by.... anyone who wished to make use of it. The playwrights made<lb facs="P20_TL00022"/>use of it once: Shakespeare, Moliere and the rest. Then Wagner took a fancy to the<lb facs="P20_TL00023"/>vineyard. Until today we find that the painter is actually making eyes at the little place....<lb facs="P20_TL00024"/>the painter, the man who has been given innumerable myriads of acres, a little patch of<lb facs="P20_TL00025"/>which he had cultivated till now so exquisitely. But now both painter, and musician, as<lb facs="P20_TL00026"/>well as the writer, have grown discontented, each with his vast possessions; and so the<lb facs="P20_TL00027"/>annexing goes on. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00028"/>And I am here to tell of this, and I claim the theatre for those born in the theatre, and<lb facs="P20_TL00029"/>we will have it! Today, or tomorrow, or in a hundred years, but we will have it! So you<lb facs="P20_TL00030"/>see I do not wish to remove the plays from the stage from any affectation, but first because<lb facs="P20_TL00031"/>I hold that the plays are spoiled in the theatre, and secondly I hold that the plays and the<lb facs="P20_TL00032"/>playwrights are spoiling u5.... that is %to say are robbing us of our self-reliance and our vitality.<lb facs="P20_TL00033"/>In Germany and in England, even in Holland where they are at times particularly<lb facs="P20_TL00034"/>intelligent, they follow up their statement that I wish unreasonably to drive out the plays<lb facs="P20_TL00035"/>and the playwrights from the theatre without reason, by adding that I wish to introduce<lb facs="P20_TL00036"/>the paintet in the place of the author. &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00037"/>&amp; What leads them to surmise this, is that I happen to have made very many stage<lb facs="P20_TL00038"/>designs on paper. In my time I have produced many pieces on the stage, and in most cases<lb facs="P20_TL00039"/>when doing so, I have not previously produced designs on paper; and if I possessed a theatre<lb facs="P20_TL00040"/>of my own, I should not convey on to paper the designs which are in my mind, but I should<lb facs="P20_TL00041"/>place them directly on to the stage. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00042"/>But as I have not yet this theatre of my own, and as my mind leaves me no rest until<lb facs="P20_TL00043"/>these designs and ideas are put into one form or another, I have been forced to make<lb facs="P20_TL00044"/>studies of these ideas with the limited means at my disposal. And so lam judged by what<lb facs="P20_TL00045"/>is seen on paper and am acclaimed as Maler, (painter); and instantly the thoughtless scream<lb facs="P20_TL00046"/>out, "Ha, ha! we have unearthed this terrible conspiracy; this man is only arguing from<lb facs="P20_TL00047"/>a little standpoint. He only wants to oust our plays from the stage so that his pictures<lb facs="P20_TL00048"/>may come there instead". &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00049"/>But, gentlemen, I assure you you have made another mistake. A mistake very easy to<lb facs="P20_TL00050"/>make and very difficult to avoid making, because you naturally say to yourselves, " If he is<lb facs="P20_TL00051"/>not a painter what is he? He can't be a stage manager, because a stage-manager first<lb facs="P20_TL00052"/>demands a playwright, and this man does not demand a playwright". 3 see your difficulty<lb facs="P20_TL00053"/>perfectly well. HOW can you understand that which has not been; how can you believe<lb facs="P20_TL00054"/>in that which you have not seen? Oh, for a few such men.... who seeing with the mind's<lb facs="P20_TL00055"/>eye things which are visionary, believe in the heart of their minds that which they see.<lb facs="P20_TL00056"/>Let me repeat again that it is not only the writer whose work is useless in the theatre.<lb facs="P20_TL00057"/>It is the musician's work which is useless there, and it is the painter's work which is<lb facs="P20_TL00058"/>useless there. All three are utterly useless. Let them keep to their preserves, let them<lb facs="P20_TL00059"/>keep to their kingdoms, and let those of the theatre return to theirs. Only when these<lb facs="P20_TL00060"/>last are once more reunited there shall spring so great an art, and one so universally beloved,<lb facs="P20_TL00061"/>that I prophesy that a new religion will be found contained in it. That religion will preach<lb facs="P20_TL00062"/>no more, but it will reveal. It will not show us the definite images which the sculptor and<lb facs="P20_TL00063"/>the painter show. It will unveil thought to our eyes, silently.... by movement.... in visions.<lb facs="P20_TL00064"/>&amp; So you see n0w.... 1 hope you see.... that the Theatre has nothing to do with the painter,</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P21_TB00002">
                                    <lb facs="P21_TL00002"/>or painting, fust as it has nothing to do with the playwright and literature. You also see that<lb facs="P21_TL00003"/>my proposition is a very harmless 0ne.... some of you will say a very foolish 0ne.... this of<lb facs="P21_TL00004"/>restoring our ancient and honourable Art. Very harmless, because you see that I am<lb facs="P21_TL00005"/>entirely free from antagonism towards the poets or the dramatists; and what feeling I have<lb facs="P21_TL00006"/>about the matter is so slight, that it will influence the modern theatre but little. The<lb facs="P21_TL00007"/>modern theatre will retain its place and will go on being the modern theatre until the<lb facs="P21_TL00008"/>painter shows a little more fight, and then it, will become the more modern theatre, and<lb facs="P21_TL00009"/>then some other artist, perhaps the architect, will have his turn; and then the two will<lb facs="P21_TL00010"/>fight it 0ut.... it will be a beautiful little tussle.... and we, the men of the theatre, that is<lb facs="P21_TL00011"/>to say the third dog, will run off with the bone....

Our head must be able to<lb facs="P21_TL00026"/>overlook that which the head of another can grasp; our heart must be able to feel that<lb facs="P21_TL00027"/>which the heart of another can feel. The intermingling of the rules will not give rise to<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>looseness; and, though the example should prove dangerous, yet it is at bottom better to<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>make a confused piece than a cold one.<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>Indeed, if only more persons were alive to this inner form, which comprehends within<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>itself all forms, we should not be disgusted by so many abortive productions of the intellect;<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>writers would not think of expanding every tragic event into a drama and of slicing up<lb facs="P21_TL00033"/>every novel into a play. I wish that some clever individual would parody this twofold<lb facs="P21_TL00034"/>nuisance by arranging, say, the /Esopian fable of the Wolf and the Lamb in the form of a<lb facs="P21_TL00035"/>tragedy in five acts. &lt;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00036"/>Every form, even that which admits of the greatest amount of feeling, has in it something<lb facs="P21_TL00037"/>that is untrue.

But as for<lb facs="P21_TL00039"/>the glass—he to whom it is not given, will not succeed in obtaining it, do what he will.

For, as Mr W. S. Lilley writes,<lb facs="P22_TL00077"/>44 the incommunicable attribute of genius is<lb facs="P22_TL00078"/>44 that active imagination which constrains<lb facs="P22_TL00079"/>44 exterior objects to express the artist's<lb facs="P22_TL00080"/>44 thought. " &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00081"/>As Mr Rhoades points out, a poet can take a<lb facs="P22_TL00082"/>handful of common words, such as 44 blow ",<lb facs="P22_TL00083"/>&lt;4winter," 44und" 44unkind," "ingratitude," &amp;,<lb facs="P22_TL00084"/>with a sprinkling of conjunctions, prepositions<lb facs="P22_TL00085"/>and pronouns, 44 transform them into a thing<lb facs="P22_TL00086"/>of perfect beauty and immortal breath." So,<lb facs="P22_TL00087"/>on the stage, the artists of the stage should<lb facs="P22_TL00088"/>begin to create like wonders from the barest<lb facs="P22_TL00089"/>material.<lb facs="P22_TL00090"/>And the audience? Would they be discontented<lb facs="P22_TL00091"/>before such a representation? We do not<lb facs="P22_TL00092"/>think so: for, to quote Mr. Rhoades again,<lb facs="P22_TL00093"/>(since what he says of his scholars would, we<lb facs="P22_TL00094"/>believe, apply also to their elders) 44 they have<lb facs="P22_TL00095"/>imagination and to spare: what it needs is<lb facs="P22_TL00096"/>wakening and directing. " &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00097"/>We do not deny that the imaginative faculty,<lb facs="P22_TL00098"/>so fresh and strong in the young, does become<lb facs="P22_TL00099"/>to a certain extent atrophied in older persons,<lb facs="P22_TL00100"/>when, through long years, it is never exercised:<lb facs="P22_TL00101"/>but even so we believe that it is not so much<lb facs="P22_TL00102"/>dead as dormant, and is ready to awaken at<lb facs="P22_TL00103"/>the right appeal. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00104"/>That this appeal is at present but rarely made<lb facs="P22_TL00105"/>in the theatre all will admit.

The youth is gone anyhow,<lb facs="P25_TL00094"/>for we must not forget that it is youth that<lb facs="P25_TL00095"/>springs joyously to the works of Meredith<lb facs="P25_TL00096"/>and Whistler, knowing it will find Youth in<lb facs="P25_TL00097"/>these works,... and even Youth may claim<lb facs="P25_TL00098"/>that it knows something about pleasure, for<lb facs="P25_TL00099"/>it creates pleasure if it does not go in search<lb facs="P25_TL00100"/>of it. But the writer of the " Westminster<lb facs="P25_TL00101"/>Gazette " letter is evidently masquerading,<lb facs="P25_TL00102"/>pretending, laughing, having "a bit of fun",<lb facs="P25_TL00103"/>and so is typical of the weary middle-aged<lb facs="P25_TL00104"/>party in England, who want " fun " at all<lb facs="P25_TL00105"/>costs. Ashamed to be simple, alarmed lest<lb facs="P25_TL00106"/>they may be serious, frightened to feel<lb facs="P25_TL00107"/>anything, they assume the penny satin mask<lb facs="P25_TL00108"/>sold and bought by the million, and feel they<lb facs="P25_TL00109"/>are " awfully witty " daring ".... " what<lb facs="P25_TL00110"/>fun". Fun without wit, watery fun, the<lb facs="P25_TL00111"/>consequence of delaying until middle age....<lb facs="P25_TL00112"/>cautious fun.... flopping fun.... fun getting up<lb facs="P25_TL00113"/>at midday.... fagged-out fun. This is what<lb facs="P25_TL00114"/>such a writer asks for in the Theatre, <lb facs="P25_TL00115"/>and too often gets. &amp; J?</ab>

In that little city Thomas B. Mosher has been printing, without<lb facs="P2_TL00038"/>flourish of trumpets or wide advertising, volume after volume which in artistic excellence<lb facs="P2_TL00039"/>are not excelled by the issues of any publishing house in the world. Then, too, Mosher has<lb facs="P2_TL00040"/>reprinted only the gems of literature that have been declared of the first water; gems that<lb facs="P2_TL00041"/>are, beyond objection, jewels of the world's treasury of brilliant writing. We may also<lb facs="P2_TL00042"/>assert that the question of gain has been secondary in Mosher's calculations. He has put<lb facs="P2_TL00043"/>out very small editions, and he has made them so beautiful in all that concerns their make-<lb facs="P2_TL00044"/>up that it is doubtful if he has ever gauged the expenditure by the possible profit. Never-<lb facs="P2_TL00045"/>theless, he must have done so, but in doing so he excites our admiration. £&gt;<lb facs="P2_TL00046"/>QUY CARLETON LEE in Baltimore Sun for Dec. 18, &amp;<lb facs="P2_TL00047"/>My new Catalogue a remarkable piece of book-work in itself explains this unusual<lb facs="P2_TL00048"/>compliment, and is sent free on request to book-lovers anywhere that can be reached<lb facs="P2_TL00049"/>by mail.

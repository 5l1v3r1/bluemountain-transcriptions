This Edition will contain Text of the Play,<lb facs="P2_TL00007"/>Descriptions and Designs for each Scene, each Costume, each piece of Furniture used.<lb facs="P2_TL00008"/>It will also contain ground plans of each scene and full directions as to how to light<lb facs="P2_TL00009"/>the play. Every movement of the Actors will be noted at the side of the Text, and<lb facs="P2_TL00010"/>at times a design will help the student to the full significance of the movements. &amp;<lb facs="P2_TL00011"/>'"phe designs will be engraved upon wood, and in some cases otherwise reproduced,<lb facs="P2_TL00012"/>if not injurious to the beauty of the book as a whole.<lb facs="P2_TL00013"/>'phis Edition will be the work of Mr Gordon Craig, the reason impelling<lb facs="P2_TL00014"/>him to such a task being the absense of any stage directions by Shakespeare,<lb facs="P2_TL00015"/>and the desire to give expression of what he considers to be the entire Art<lb facs="P2_TL00016"/>of the Stage Director. <lb facs="P2_TL00017"/>phe work will be a very large one", possibly stretching into three volumes. The size,<lb facs="P2_TL00018"/>will be that of 44 The Mask ". The first few pages will be found in the subscribers'<lb facs="P2_TL00019"/>copies of 44 The Mask " for 1908, but will not be found in the ordinary edition. The<lb facs="P2_TL00020"/>work may be completed in 1909, when the full details of the edition will be announced.<lb facs="P2_TL00021"/>phose desirous of obtaining the entire book when ready, can apply by letter to the<lb facs="P2_TL00022"/>Publishers of 44 The Mask 44. The book will be an expensive one, and it is not<lb facs="P2_TL00023"/>likely that a popular edition will be issued for some time. &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>I said, at the commencement of my notes on this play, that in fixing 1590 as the date of<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>the action there was a reason which would appear later on. The 4&lt; reason " lies before<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>me as 1 write, in the form of a small thick book, bound in well-worn crimson<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>velvet, cut on cloth of gold, and of that large counter«changed pattern Veronese and Tintoretto<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>delighted to paint. On the title=page I read, " Ahiti Antichi, et Moilerni di tntto il Mondo.<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>Di Cesare Vecellio. " The letter of dedication is dated at Venice, October 9, 1589, or just<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>one year before the date I have assigned to the play. The work is divided into twelve books,<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>making a total of 505 pages; of these, 228 belong to the first book, which is devoted to the<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>costumes of Italy, and 81 of these to the then modern costumes of Venice. These 81 illustrations<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>may therefore be accepted as unquestionable authorities, but of the correctness of the antique<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>I entertain considerable doubt, and many of the examples, though modern,<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>seem to me to demand verification. However this may be, one cannot but recognise the<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>enormous value of such a work, and with this book in one's hand, the paintings and prints<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>in our public galleries and the materials at South Kensington to refer to, error in the costume<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>of the Merchant of Venice would be quite inexcusable, for it must arise either from sheer<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>carelessness or childish incompetency to handle the facts. jg? &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>Of other authorities besides Vecellio we have, before all, Tintoretto, who died in 1594, and<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>who was 78 years old when the Merchant of Venice was written; Bassano, who died in 1592,<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>was 80 years old at the time; Zelotti was 58; Allori and Rubens were both boys of 13.<lb facs="P5_TL00039"/>Veronese had been dead two years, Moroni twelve, Titian fourteen, and Bordone nineteen,<lb facs="P5_TL00040"/>before the play opens. 1 should therefore be inclined to limit the range of authorities for<lb facs="P5_TL00041"/>Venetian costume to—<lb facs="P5_TL00042"/>Vecellio . . 1589<lb facs="P5_TL00043"/>Tintoretto. . 1512—1594<lb facs="P5_TL00044"/>Bassano . . 1510—1592 Nat.

Gall., 26, 268, 97.<lb facs="P5_TL00047"/>There are also four folio plates, drawn and engraved by J. Amman, representing the procession<lb facs="P5_TL00048"/>of the Doge, which may be consulted as explanatory of the subject shown in the 148 th engraving<lb facs="P5_TL00049"/>in Vecellio (1). &amp; JI?<lb facs="P5_TL00050"/>Of the cqstume of the main land, of the ambassadors of foreign States, of the traders of<lb facs="P5_TL00051"/>divers nations, from the north, south, east, and west, who flocked to Venice, Vecellio may<lb facs="P5_TL00052"/>be taken as an authority in some measure; but wherever possible, it would be well to test<lb facs="P5_TL00053"/>the Venetian by reference to sculptures, paintings, engravings, or embroideries executed by</ab>

Comparing both with Amman's engraving and contemporary<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>paintings, we find the dress to consist of an ermine cape or tippet reaching to the elbow,<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>shaped with a slight upright collar, entirely open from the throat downwards, and having<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>six large buttons on the left edge. These buttons were sometimes very costly, and always<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>important features. Benvenuto Cellini (ob. 1561) made some of gold, set with precious stones.<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>And in Amman's engraving the button has four stones set round it and one mounted in<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>the centre (1). Under the cape appears a robe or cloak, with a train. In Vecellio's procession<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>(p. 128) the train is borne by one of the Doge's esquires, whilst another holds over him the<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>canopy of state—a large heavy umbrella sort of structure, shown in detail by Amman. The<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>robe is covered with a large rich pattern of conventional branch and leaf, and a similar<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>pattern is seen on the gown. This last-named garment nearly touches the ground, has large<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>open sleeves reaching below the knee, is trimmed with fur, is open down the front, and<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>gathered in at the waist by a belt. On the head was worn the curious horn-shaped biretta,<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>which is the great distinguishing mark of the Doge in works of art subsequent to the Byzantine<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>period, and beneath this a closely-fitting white cap, coming down under it so as to cover<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>the ears and the back of the head. Strings were attached to the front edges of this cap,<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>sometimes tied under the chin, but often allowed to hang loose. The ordinary or everyday<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>biretta was of red velvet with a deep border of gold embroidery. The State ones had<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>Jewelled borders, and crests of gold knobs or jewels on the top of the border and edging<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>the central line or seam from the front to the back. But we must not suppose that the<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>Doge of Venice had only one dress. Besides the State full dress above noted, and others<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>regulated to various occasions by the etiquette of the time, there were gowns and mantles<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>suited by their material to the various seasons of the year. The dress, however, which<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>Shakspere's Doge would have worn would most probably have been a gown and robe of<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>crimson (purple) velvet, embroidered with gold or cut on cloth of gold. But whatever the<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>colour of the robe may be—crimson and gold, white and gold, white and silver. &amp;c.—the<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>biritta must be of the same colour and material, except only in its deep border or band,<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>which is chiefly of cloth of gold woven with an Eastern pattern, probably made in Damascus;<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>although on great State occasions we sometimes find this band set with jewels. The tippet<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>was part of the full dress, and would not be worn in the play, or indeed except on very<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>important days, such as when the chair of State was borne aloft before the Duke. &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>jz? The Prince of Morocco, dressed like other noble Moors, would wear a loose and full white<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>cotton gown with capacious sleeves and high neck, girded with a sash of delicate craps<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>like material full of coloured stripes and gold, the ends of which were deeply fringed and<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>hung as low as the knee. On his head he would wear a spotlessly white low turban, shaped<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>like a small pillow, bound round the centre with a broad band. The skirt of his dress would be<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>tucked through his girdle, hanging therefrom in irregular an graceful folds nearly to the<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>ground. On his legs appeared red Morocco buskins: and his shoes were of leather of another<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>colour, both often richly embroidered with gold and silver. Large rings of gold depended<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>from his ears, and across his breast glittered his leathern sword belt, loaded, I might almost<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>say clogged, with precious stones (" ad pectus uerb fascia gemmis magni precii onusta<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>inter currit "),<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>&amp; The Prince of Aragon would be dressed like a noble in the Court of the King of Spain, for<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>Aragon was no longer an independent kingdom, but had been united to Castile, to which<lb facs="P6_TL00056"/>Granada and, in 1512, Navarre were also added. The most important points to be noted in<lb facs="P6_TL00057"/>this costume is the shortness of the trunks, which are only just visible below the doublet,<lb facs="P6_TL00058"/>the short cloak, and the increased length of the skirt of the doublet. Ruffs appear round<lb facs="P6_TL00059"/>the neck and wrists, and on the head a tall bag-like hat with very narrow brim. The cloak<lb facs="P6_TL00060"/>was usually of " purple " (crimson) silk or velvet lined with costly material, sometimes<lb facs="P6_TL00061"/>richly embroidered with gold. It was worn occasionally with a hood, and was often wrapped<lb facs="P6_TL00062"/>round the breast in a careless-looking but eminently artistic manner. &amp; &amp; &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00002"/>&amp; Bassanio, described in the text as a lord and a fit suitor for the hand of the Lady of Belmont,<lb facs="P7_TL00003"/>is one of the nobles of Venice, and would be dressed in doublet, trunk hose to below the<lb facs="P7_TL00004"/>knee, stockings and shoes, and over all in the house a houpelande, with hanging sleeves of<lb facs="P7_TL00005"/>much the same shape as that worn in the fifteenth century. (Compare Vecellio, p. 86, and<lb facs="P7_TL00006"/>MS, Bib. Nat. Girart de Nevcrs, an illustration from which is given in the Dictionnaire<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>Raisomie du Mobilier, vol. iii. p. 466) But abroad he would change the over garment for<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>the large-sleeved gown or toga. The cream of the aristocracj', that is the chiefs or heads<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>of the leading families, adopt, commonly, crimson for the colour of the under-dress, and black<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>for the gown. If a noble is also one of the greater officers of the State, the sleeve is open<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>its full depth, but otherwise it is closed tight round the wrist, not unlike the neck of a<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>sack. Gloves, having stiff wristbands attached, are worn or carried in the hand, and the<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>cap is a plain, round, flat-topped, limp sort of pork-pie hat. The gown was shaped at the<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>neck so as to produce a stand-up collar, and over one shoulder was worn the long narrow<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>strip which distinguished nobles and magistrates—altogether not a very picturesque costume.<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>Solanio, Salarino, Gratiano, and Lorenzo may, on the other hand, be attired in eminently<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>picturesque dresses. The long gown reaching to the feet, with its ugly baggy sleeves, forms<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>no part of the ordinary Venetian habit. The scholars and young gentlemen wore short<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>cloaks, with collars, slashed doublets thick set with buttons down the front, slashed sleeves,<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>rather easy in the upper part, but tight in the forearm, slashed trunk hose, with three or<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>four buttons at the side of the knee, stockings, and light slipper-like shoes. Round the neck<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>they wore ruffs like that adopted in Spain, France, England, and indeed all Western Europe,<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>in the last quarter of the sixteenth century. The hat or cap was a tall bag-like structure, with<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>a stiff narrow rim. They wore ruffs at the wrist, and carried swords. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>&amp; Antonio, the Merchant of Venice, with whom we may also class Shylock (1) and Tubal, for<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>the difference between them was only in the colour of their caps, would be attired like any<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>other merchant, i.e. in doublet, trunk hose, stockings, and shoes, old men wearing over all<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>a gown reaching to the heels, with sleeves tight in the lower arm and loose above. The<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>gown was fastened in front from top to bottom with buttons and button holes sewn in<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>braids, and the skirt was open at the sides, fastened by four or five buttons at the bottom<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>likewise on braids. It was girded at the waist with a silk sash having small tassels depending<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>in front. Over the dress, gowned or not, was worn a large cape or short cloak of silk or<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>brocade, light or heavy according to the season, with a collar as before mentioned. Round<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>the neck the merchant wore a ruff, and ruffs again appear at the wrists. The cap was<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>sometimes high and hat-shaped, with a narrow brim, and sometimes flat and largely projecting<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>like the modern Scotch cap. Like also to the nobles and other Venetian gentlemen, they<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>indulged in the luxury of gloves. The Jew was distinguished from the Christian by being<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>compelled to have his cap made of a tawny yellow material, sometimes so tawny as to appear<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>almost like a faded red. &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>&amp; Launcelot Gobbo, as the Jew's servant, would not be a servant in livery, but would have a<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>plain doublet, not unlike a Norfolk shirt in general outline, trunks, stockings, shoes, and<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>a high cap with narrow brim. As Bassanio's servant, he would be in livery like Leonardo,<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>or Balthazar and Stephano, servants to Portia, whose doublets would be covered with guards,<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>or braids and buttons set very closely together. &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>Old Gobbo would wear a kind of blouse with turn-over collar, cut down to the waist in<lb facs="P7_TL00046"/>front and tied together with two or three bows. The skirt would be open at the sides, belted<lb facs="P7_TL00047"/>round the waist with a leathern strap, and beneath it would appear the ends of loose breeches,<lb facs="P7_TL00048"/>bare knees, turn-over coarse stockings, and tied shoes. The neck and throat were bare. <lb facs="P7_TL00049"/>as the daughter of a rich merchant of Venice, would be dressed in the ordinary<lb facs="P7_TL00050"/>costume of a Venetian gentlewoman. A tightly-fitting body, square cut neck before and<lb facs="P7_TL00051"/>behind, waist high at the sides and coming down low to a point both before and behind;<lb facs="P7_TL00052"/>the body laced across a stomacher; frilled shoulder-pieces; sleeves loose above, and lightly<lb facs="P7_TL00053"/>fitting to lower arm; lawn or cambric ruffs at the wrist; flowing skirt; a necklet of pearls;<lb facs="P7_TL00054"/>slipper-shaped shoes, raised on sloping chopines; front hair arranged in short massive curls<lb facs="P7_TL00055"/>on forehead, the rest strained back and done up in plait, from which depended the veil,<lb facs="P7_TL00056"/>that in the costume of a Jewess would be yellow. The dress was of no particular colour,<lb facs="P7_TL00057"/>and the skirt underneath was open in front, and tied together at intervals. &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>M Portia would do her shopping probably at Padua, and would therefore follow the fashions<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>of the main land. The chief difference we have note of is the absence of the square-cut<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>body. Highnecked bodies, with fine cambric ruffs, was the every-day attire usually worn<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>by Paduan ladies of noble birth. On state occasions, on festivals and at receptions, the<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>dress, though still high on the shoulders, was open in front, terminating at a point a little<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>above the waist. There is also a marked difference to be observed between the dress of<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>a maiden and that of a married woman, and there is no question that the Paduan ladies<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>(wives or not) indulged in a considerably extensive wardrobe. So, too, there was more than<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>one mode of dressing the hair, (i) In some cases it was crimped, parted in the middle,<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>brought round to the back over the ears, and rolled up ale grec, in others it fell loosely<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>down the back an natnrel, confined, however, at the poll by a delicately-wrought band or<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>tiara of goldsmith's work; but the more usual plan was to arrange the front hair in massive<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>curls, assuming comewhat the form of low horns, and carried down each side in smaller<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>curls to the ears, the hair behind being strained (sometimes crimped), and fastened up into<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>a plait, with strings of pearls interwoven. From this plait depended the veil, which sometimes<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>also appears to have covered the head up to a point between the horned curls or rolls, over<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>which it could be raised like a double hood. The veil itself was also worn in various ways,<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>and as it was often arranged with the utmost grace, and made of the finest material—a<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>sort of silken gauze, enriched with gold, interwoven and even sometimes embroidered and<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>decorated further with pearls and gems—its lovely film-like effect, like an iridescent mist over<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>the rich materials of the gown, can be better imagined than described. The gown, with<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>the exception already noted, was cut like the Venetian dress, and was made of silk, brocade<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>gold cloth, or costly velvet. Over the shoulders was worn a chain, usually of gold set with<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>jewels, and suspending a large jewel or cross. The pouch or gipciere worn at the girdle<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>was not quite yet abandoned, and Portia may wear one or not as she pleases. In addition<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>to this brides and married women wore a gold chain following the triangular lines of the<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>waist, and hanging down in front as low as the knee. Gowns with the skirt open up the<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>front and with loose hanging sleeves were also used by the " Sposa di Padoua. " Rings were<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>worn on the first, third, and fourth fingers. Earrings of pearls and jewels appear, and<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>sometimes we see a string of pearls one end attached to the ear and the other looped up<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>to the back hair. The veil is occasionally omitted, and a stiff semi circular collar of lace is<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>seen standing up behind the neck and reaching as high as the poll. (2) Portia's stockings<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>would be of silk or the finest thread worked with clocks and even open seams. Her shoes,<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>of slipper form, would be of morocco or of velvet embroidered with gold, cork being used<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>for the soles. On her journey to Venice she would use a velvet mask or visor, and gloves<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>highly perfumed and embroidered with gold or silver. A pocket looking-glass, with ladies<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>of rank, was not an uncommon possession, and was sometimes set in the back of the fan,<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>which was usually made of nine or more ostrich feathers, the handle set with pearls and<lb facs="P8_TL00045"/>jewels and fastened to the end of the girdle-chain, if the lady was married. The<lb facs="P8_TL00046"/>pockethandkerchief was of large size, and of fine cambric, having an embroidered border,<lb facs="P8_TL00047"/>and a tassel at each corner. Finally, in going abroad ladies wore, in the winter and later<lb facs="P8_TL00048"/>autumn, a mantle or pelisse over the gown, reaching to below the knee, open in front to<lb facs="P8_TL00049"/>the neck, and with long, loose, open, hanging sleeves. Over this came the veil, and a round<lb facs="P8_TL00050"/>velvet hat with a broad brim completed the costume, whose chief glory consisted in its richly<lb facs="P8_TL00051"/>embroidered or woven or cut patterns. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00052"/>Nerissa, " the waiting maid, " or, as we should now call her, the lady's maid—must be<lb facs="P8_TL00053"/>dressed as the confidential servant of a noble and wealthy lady, neither too rich nor yet<lb facs="P8_TL00054"/>too poor. There will still be the ruffs at neck and wrists, but of less delicate material than<lb facs="P8_TL00055"/>those [on Portia; the skirt of the gown will be shorter than her ladyship's, and there will<lb facs="P8_TL00056"/>be an absence of ornament, except perhaps as a border to the dress. She must wear a ring<lb facs="P8_TL00057"/>or two, and from her girdle would hang a pouch and huswife. She would also have a short<lb facs="P8_TL00058"/>veil of plain lawn or cambric, which she might use as a hood, pinned under the chin.<lb facs="P8_TL00059"/>&amp; Of the costume of the scores of men and women, from the " magnificoes " and ambassadors<lb facs="P8_TL00060"/>down to the porters and beggars who might fill up the stage picture, Cesare Vecellio may<lb facs="P8_TL00061"/>be consulted, for he gives us abundant illustrations of all sorts and conditions of men both</ab>

There is one professional dress which, however, we must not forget to<lb facs="P9_TL00003"/>note, and that is the official costume of a doctor of laws—the character assumed by Portia<lb facs="P9_TL00004"/>in the fourth Act. The D.C.L. of Padua wore a tight doublet, silk belt, trunk hose, and<lb facs="P9_TL00005"/>stockings, all of black; velvet in winter, silk in summer. Over these he put on his official<lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>robe or gown, ungirdled, having an upright collar and long capacious open sleeves reaching<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>nearly to the ground. This was made of velvet, silk, or damask, covered with rich pattern,<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>cut, embroidered or woven according to the nature of the material, (i) On his head he wore<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>a tolerably high cap, made with a narrow brim and a flat top, and on his feet were seen<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>the usual slipper-shoes. His clerk would wear a black cloth doublet, trunks, stockings, and<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>ruffs, but no robe or gown.<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>In conclusion, we should remember that Portia has the golden hair so much admired at that<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>time, that the officials in a Venetian Court kept their hats on although in presence of<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>the Doge, that the manners of the period were characterised by courtesy combined with a<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>stately dignified action, and that what we call stiffness of manner was then regarded as<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>quite the correct thing. But modern actors and actresses rarely hold the mirror high enough<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>to reflect the mien, deportment, or bearing of the men and women of a past age. The air<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>or look of gentlemen and ladies during the great period of the Renaissance can be ascertained<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>from the documents and the pictures of the time, and if an actor fails to reproduce it he<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>is not fitted to play in the comedies of the great dramatist of that period. Correctness of<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>costume, and properties, and furniture is all very well, but if, through it all, we see nineteenth<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>century action, modern style, the mode of Robertsonian society, or the special graces and<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>charms which are the delight of our own time, hut which would have been looked on as<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>antics, or at the least as bad form, in the Courts of Philip or Elizabeth, then the picture<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>must be discordant, and the dramatic representation wofully incomplete. &amp;</ab>

The modern<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>Writers and Painters attest to this by what they write of and paint, and by the way<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>in which they write and paint it. &amp;<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>11. And because the Realists attempt to represent nature so frankly, (which Frankness<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>they call Truth and which generally borders upon Brutality) and because this Frankness<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>is no Fruit, no Blossom, but merely the roots of a new Growth, so I believe that the<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>Actor will never ask for the same liberty as the Writers and Painters of today that he<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>may give these Brutalities their " counterfeit presentment" with all accuracy of detail<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>at command.<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>I can call to mind no actor so lacking in intelligence as to desire to present with all<lb facs="P10_TL00044"/>its actuality the moment of Death as expressed by the modern Realist in Literature<lb facs="P10_TL00045"/>and Painting,.... or the moments of Love as expressed by these same frank and most,<lb facs="P10_TL00046"/>most blind, leaders. jg?<lb facs="P10_TL00047"/>The Realists may claim that they are not concerned so much with the subjects they<lb facs="P10_TL00048"/>treat of as with the manner in which they treat these subjects. If so, then is it a most<lb facs="P10_TL00049"/>extraordinary fact that the realists only concern themselves with what is ugly or<lb facs="P10_TL00050"/>Brutal and always with what the Idealists have given so much thought to veil. &lt;£?</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P13_TL00002"/>The question you forgot to put us is whether the Public would allow the Actor to<lb facs="P13_TL00003"/>express the same feelings and the same incidents as both Idealistic and Realistic writers<lb facs="P13_TL00004"/>have somehow or other won the right to express. &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00005"/>What is the difference between the picture and the word and the living breathing<lb facs="P13_TL00006"/>actuality? Why, even the Public that sits in the Pit of a Theatre feels the difference<lb facs="P13_TL00007"/>and would refuse to let the Actor reveal what it allows Milton and Rabelais to reveal.<lb facs="P13_TL00008"/>Then how can there be a shadow of doubt that the Actor not only should not be<lb facs="P13_TL00009"/>permitted the same liberty as the Writer or Painter, but actually is not permitted<lb facs="P13_TL00010"/>that license? &amp; *&amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>111. Realism is a vulgar means of expression bestowed upon the Blind. Thus we have the<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>clear-sighted singing," Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty,.... that is all ye know on earth,<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>and all ye need to know ". The Blind are heard croaking, " Beauty is Realism, Realism<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>Beauty,.... that is all I know on earth, and all I care to, ...don't cher know". &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>The difference is all a matter of love. He who loves the Earth sees Beauty everywhere:<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>he is a god transforming by knowledge the incomplete into the complete. He can heal<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>the lame and the sick, can blow courage into the weary, and he can even learn how<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>to make the blind see. The power has always been possessed by the Artist,.... who,<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>in my opinion, rules the Earth.<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>It is quite likely that Realism may appeal at one period to the Public and not at<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>another period, The Public is not concerned with the quest of knowledge; no, not<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>even with the wisdoms of wisdom, that simple everyday atom of Truth which waits, unseen,<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>everlastingly everywhere. The Public is concerned with the quest of money,.... and,<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>with money, that fat and brutal power to Revenge which it can bring... that power<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>to give like a Lady a handshake when a kiss is too little; that power to give like<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>a Lord ten pounds to a " por beggar ", and that power to give a little charity when only<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>love is enough. &amp; &amp; And so long as the Public is made up of this class of monstrous<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>meanness,.... of that which gives half or three quarters instead of all, so long will it<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>love its Realism, which is the short measure or meanness of the Artist. <lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>Anyhow, there is nothing which need cause Playgoers anxiety; there is no need for<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>them to feel depressed;... furious, if you like, but depressed? not a whit: for the<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>limited section of Playgoers who love Beauty and detest Realism is a small minority<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>of about six million souls. They are scattered here and there over the earth. They<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>seldom, if ever, go to the modern Theatre. That is why I love them, and intend to<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>unite them.</ab>

If anything, Super-Realism may be artistic, because it is a sort of<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>Plus-Lfife, Life on intellectual stilts. *&amp;&amp;&amp;&lt;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>ll® iNo: for the Actor is not the only factor concerned on the stage. Whilst the Writer's or<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>the Painter's work is an end to itself, the Actor's work is only part of a bigger scheme<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>in which other artistic elements enter, independent from him. Is Man the central figure<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>of Creation? Is the Actor the principal feature of the Stage? &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00045"/>111. Realism appeals exclusively to the vulgar crowd on account of the no effort and no culture<lb facs="P13_TL00046"/>it requires to be grasped. On the other hand an artistic rendering, which has nothing<lb facs="P13_TL00047"/>to do with Realism, appeals to the limited group of playgoers who have good taste.<lb facs="P13_TL00048"/>Only Super=Realism, for different causes and in different doses, can appeal both to the<lb facs="P13_TL00049"/>general public and to the select few. </ab>

There is enough superficial chatter<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>on the subject in various languages, but special rules, known to everyone, pronounced with<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>distinctness and precision, according to which the blame or the praise of an actor can be<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>defined in a particular case, of such I scarcely know two or three. Thence it arises that<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>all our reasoning about this subject always seems so vacillating and dubious, and that it is<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>small wonder if the actor who possesses nothing but a happy routine, feels himself offended<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>by it in all ways.

He lived in an age when much was done and biographies were scarce. His name<lb facs="P15_TL00008"/>has survived as an architect and a designer of Masques. Today he is probably better known<lb facs="P15_TL00009"/>to the majority of people by his portrait which Vandyke painted than by his architectural<lb facs="P15_TL00010"/>works. To nickname him the " English Palladio " is to dismiss him with a second hand<lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>compliment, shorn of half his laurels. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>He was born in the year 1573. Sir Francis Bacon, Shakespeare, Spencer, Christopher<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>Marlow, Sir Philip Sydney, Sir Walter Raleigh, Robert Flood, Ben Jonson, Philip Massinger,<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>Milton, Samuel Butler, John Locke and John Bunyan were his contemporaries. A Londoner<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>by birth, he was christened in the church of St Bartholomew in the Cloth Workers' quarter,<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>where annually the great cloth fair took place. His father, Ignatius Jones, was himself a<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>clothworker. His son was, according to Walpole, apprenticed to a joiner. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>The first authentic information we have about Inigo Jones is that, at an early age, he<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>went to Italy to study landscape painting. It has been stated that he was sent there either<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>by the Earl of Arundel or Pembroke, who had taken an interest in the boy, but he himself<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>states that it was his love of study and travel that took him there, and does not hint at<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>any patron. In Italy he became interested in Architecture and spent much of his time<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>studying and measuring the buildings. From Italy he was invited by Charles IV to Denmark,<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>where he designed and built, it is said, the royal palaces of Rosenborg and Fredericksborg.<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>When in the year 1605 he accompanied Ann of Denmark to the Court of James I, his<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>reputation was already made, he was at once appointed Architect to the Queen and<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>Prince Henry and employed in the designs and decorations of the Court Masques. His<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>first Masque was produced in the year in which he came over, in conjunction with Ben<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>Jonson, who at the same time made his debut as a writer of Masques. In the same year he<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>was employed on the scenery and devices for three plays presented before the King. "They<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>hired one, Mr Jones, a great traveller, who undertook to further them much and furnish<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>them with rare devices, but performed little to what was expected ". He all the same<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>made some innovations, for the writer of the letter in which this information is given goes<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>on to state that he had an arrangement of " Columns moving about, so that three scenes were<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>given in one tragedy ". But if the stage scenery did not come up to expectation, in the<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>Masques expectation was surpassed. For several years to come Masque followed Masque,<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>the jMasque of Hymen, The Masque of Queens, The Princes Masque and many others. He<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>was appointed Prince Henry's Surveyor of Works, and then came in 1612 the death of Prince<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>Henry, " the glory of our own and the grief of other nations ", and Inigo Jones, after ar<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>ranging one more Masque, this time with Chapman, to commemorate the marriage of the<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>Princess Elizabeth with Frederic the Elector Palatine, finding himself free set off again for<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>Italy, this time under the patronage of the Earls of Arundel and Pembroke. A devoted<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>admirer of Palladio, we hear of him taking a copy of his work about with him wherever he went.<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>He returned to England on the death of Simon Basil, the surveyor general of the royal<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>buildings under James 1., and was appointed Surveyor in his place, being paid eight shillings<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>a day for his entertainment, eighty pounds a year for his " recompense of availed " and two<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>shillings and eight pence a day for his riding and travelling charges, the which sum was<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>afterwards increased. The Surveyor was required to superintend and repair the various<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>palaces, devise alterations, and inspect works. Extra payments were made for work such<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>as that of repairing Ely House, for certain works carried out in the Star Chamber, and " for<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>making a Hearse for the Queen's funerall &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00005"/>&amp; After the deaths of the Queen and Prince Henry, Masques were not in such great requisition<lb facs="P16_TL00006"/>and Inigo Jones devoted himself chiefly to architecture. In 1619 he commenced the New<lb facs="P16_TL00007"/>Banquefting Hall, Whitehall, which was burnt down shortly afterwards: he built the Chapel<lb facs="P16_TL00008"/>at Lincoln's Inn, the Chapel of the Infante, Somerset House which was destroyed of recent<lb facs="P16_TL00009"/>years by a lesser architect, Sir William Chambers; he also built the water gate to the town<lb facs="P16_TL00010"/>house of Villiers, Duke of Buckingham. He was made one of the Commissioners for the<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>repair of St Paul's Cathedral, which was begun in 1633 and put a stop to by the civil war.<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>He built the theatre of Barber Surgeons, Monkswell St, began the Piazza of Covent Garden,<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>a building with a red brick front, stone pilasters and red tiled roof, which years after<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>passed under his name when the red brick had been covered with stucco and the red tiled<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>roof replaced by slates. In 1631 he began the church of Covent Garden, of which the tale<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>is told of how the Earl of Bedford, sending for the architect, explained to him how he<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>wan led a chapel for the parishioners, but that he would not go to any considerable expense:<lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>" in short, 1 would not have it much better than a barn to which Inigo replied, " You<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>shall have the handsomest barn in England ". This church was his last architectural work.<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>The civil war broke out and building stopped and the Masques ceased. Inigo Jones joined<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>the royalist forces and was taken, sword in hand, at the Siege of Basing. He was fined and<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>imprisoned. His outlook was gloomy; his office of surveyor, which he held under Charles I.<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>after the death of James, if not extinct, was unpaid; when released from prison he had<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>no work and had to live on his savings, and these he, together with Nicholas Stone, the<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>sculptor of the Monument to Sir Francis Vere in Westminster Abbey, buried in a private<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>place near his house in Scotland Yard; but as four servants had assisted at the burial, he<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>became fearful lest its resting place should be discovered and so dug it up and reburied it<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>in Lambeth Marsh. He died just before the Restoration and was buried according to the<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>register of St. Bennets on June 16. 1152, &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>Inigo Jones became a designer of Masques, as far as we know, in the prime of life, and<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>probably in them he gave some of his best work as an artist. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>The Masques were descended from the mystic performences of the past; their origin lies far<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>back in the rites of the Eleusinian and other mysteries. The Mask, from the use of which<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>the performances took their name, was originally used in dances to represent mythical<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>personages. As in the head dress of Egyptian deities the qualities of the god were represented,<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>so in these dances the qualities of the deity would be exposed by the Mask worn by the<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>performer.<lb facs="P16_TL00038"/>The Masque was the root of all other dramatic performances, it contained all in embryo, it<lb facs="P16_TL00039"/>shadowed forth endless possibilities, but in itself it differed from all other forms of expression.<lb facs="P16_TL00040"/>It was all movement, and expressed, so to speak, the rhythm of the universe and appealed<lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>to and satisfied that craving we all feel for union with that rhythm. It was as changing<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>as the sea, as nature herself. The words passing into song and the music urging on the dance,<lb facs="P16_TL00043"/>By means of movement they caused, in the beholder, an exaltation of his poetic nature.<lb facs="P16_TL00044"/>They were acted poems, poetry expressed in words, music, dance and scenic accompaniment.<lb facs="P16_TL00045"/>Like an orchestra of many different instruments, each one of which touches a different<lb facs="P16_TL00046"/>chord in the hearer's heart, so that he is swept away and becomes as one with the performers,<lb facs="P16_TL00047"/>the Masque, by appealing to so many sides of man's nature and striking the same note on<lb facs="P16_TL00048"/>each, brought him into tune with the masquers, and the whole hall, audience and performers<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>alike, were as one instrument responding to the touch of the artist's hand, who wittingly<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>or unwittingly had touched a note to which all must respond. In the Masque, in fact, the<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>audience and the performers were as one; there is an intimate bond of union which is, at<lb facs="P16_TL00052"/>times, expressed in the words of the Masque itself, and the members of the audience, as<lb facs="P16_TL00053"/>in the marriage Masques, often furnish the subject on which the Masque is constructed.<lb facs="P16_TL00054"/>The spirit of the more ancient Masques appears in the symbolic figures, the Greek and<lb facs="P16_TL00055"/>Roman deities, the Nature spirits, the Virtues and Vices that were introduced; they were<lb facs="P16_TL00056"/>all symbols, and symbols are keys opening, for those who can use them, stores of knowledge.<lb facs="P16_TL00057"/>&lt;&lt;&amp; They were of immense advantage to the artist composing and arranging the Masques;<lb facs="P16_TL00058"/>forming a nucleus round which ideas clustered; they at once furnished the poet with a<lb facs="P16_TL00059"/>subject for his verse, the musician with a theme for his song, the designer and painter<lb facs="P16_TL00060"/>with a groundwork for their scenes, and gave a direction to the feet of the dancers. These<lb facs="P16_TL00061"/>figures had been moulded by the ages, and their symbolism stamped by generations of</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P17_TB00002">
                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00002"/>worshippers in the past. The audience was expected to recognize them and understand<lb facs="P17_TL00003"/>their significance. Their costumes like a coat of arms proclaimed their personality. Rumour,<lb facs="P17_TL00004"/>in a skin coat full of winged tongues; Curiosity and Error in a like coat, the one full of eyes,<lb facs="P17_TL00005"/>the other scaled like a serpent, with hair of curled snakes and a deformed vizard; Credulity<lb facs="P17_TL00006"/>was painted over with ears. The Earth wore a grass green coat and mantle painted over<lb facs="P17_TL00007"/>with trees, plants and flowers, and with an oak headdress. Water had a waved coat with<lb facs="P17_TL00008"/>a mantle full of fishes and a dolphin headdress. The Air was clothed in a skin coat with<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>a mantle painted with birds, and with an eagle headdress. Fire wore a skin coat with a<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>mantle painted with flames and on the head a cap of flames with a Salamander in<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>the midst. In the Masques there was hardly any plot and hardly any episode. It was an<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>allegory, a little vision, which approached the spectators, made its bow and with a<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>few compliments vanished. 44 It was written for princes and by princes it was played ".<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>44 Like a Good Comedy it required " as Mr Meredith says, 44 a society of cultivated men and<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>women where ideas are current and perceptions quick ". Then you are shown 44 a world<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>enlarged to our embrace by imagination and by great poetic imagination ", a world in which<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>the forces of nature take a mortal shape. It is not the individuals who move and sing<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>and dance; thej' are the Gods that rule men's destinies, the spirits of earth and air and<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>water, the symbols of men's passions, their virtues and vices. Apollo " who taught the Muses<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>all their harmonies; " Jove,44 the power that governs and conserveth all earth, sea and ayre";<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>Merecles, 44 great friend and servant of the Gods "; The Fates who spin and weave and cut<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>the thread of human destinies; Lethe, the giver of forgetfulness ; Atlas, 44 hoary and frosted ";<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>Night with its dance of phantoms; Phosphorus, herald of the day, all move in the Masque. What<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>opportunities are given the scenic artist with the House of Night, the triumph of Fame, the<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>Palace of Neptune and the House of Prometheus, from which fiery spirits, clothed in flames,<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>with fiery wings and 44 bearing in either hand a torch of virgin wax came forth dancing, " and<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>what opportunities for the dancers in the dance of Phantoms, the dance of the Signs of the<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>Zodiac, the dance of the Winds, the dances of Witches, of Nymphs and Dryads. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>The Masque was produced by the combined aristocracy of birth and talent. Ben Jonson<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>found expression in them for his learning, Milton gave in his Masque of Comus some of his<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>richest verse. Lord Bacon, Whitelock and Selden invented the devices for the last great<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>Masque presented to Charles I, and composed the procession of Masques and Antimasques.<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>The songs and dances were set to music and arranged by the most celebrated masters, and<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>the performers were often the highest in the land, the King and Queen themselves frequently<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>taking part.<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>The age in which they were performed was not an age of specialists. An artist was not<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>depreciated in any way because he could express himself in more than one material. Inigo Jones<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>besides being an architect and designer of Masques was a writer of sonnets, a painter and<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>a most capable draughtsman. Ben Jonson not only wrote Masques, but designed and produced<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>them himself. One Masque was designed by a master carpenter, another by a dancing master.<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>The members of the court who so frequently took the chief parts in the Masque were taught<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>dancing and learned something of the actor's art as a necessary part of the education of<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>one called upon to take a leading part in courtly pageants. &amp; «&amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>This overlapping, so to speak, of craftsmanship, made for the great success of the Masque.<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>The artist, while attending to his own branch of the work, understood as a fellow craftsman<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>would, the aims and difficulties of his fellow workmen, and could further the one and<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>help to overcome the other, in away that is almost impossible when each artist, bound up<lb facs="P17_TL00048"/>in his own work, fails to understand at a glance the technical difficulties another in another<lb facs="P17_TL00049"/>branch has to deal with. Inigo Jones, as an architect, would find in the Masque a means of<lb facs="P17_TL00050"/>expressing himself in away that would otherwise be impossible, away that is unfortunately<lb facs="P17_TL00051"/>denied to modern architects. Like a Genie out of the Arabian Nights, he was endowed<lb facs="P17_TL00052"/>with the power to raise magic buildings in a single night. The walls might be of jasper or<lb facs="P17_TL00053"/>rare marbles, there was no one to complain of the cost; the statues that adorned them<lb facs="P17_TL00054"/>were of gold and silver in place of stone, and the windows gleamed like jewels by the aid<lb facs="P17_TL00055"/>of coloured lights. These buildings would be for the architect gigantic models in which<lb facs="P17_TL00056"/>he could try effects before he ventured them in brick and stone. It is difficult for us today to<lb facs="P17_TL00057"/>realise what effect they would have on the public, they would be so fresh and strange, a dream<lb facs="P17_TL00058"/>within a dream, a work of art encased in a work of art. &amp; In the Masque of Queens which</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00005"/>was written by Ben Jon son and designed by Inigo Jones, the former gives a description of the<lb facs="P18_TL00006"/>House of Fame. 44 First for the lower columns he chose the statues of the most excellent Poets,<lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>" as Homer, Virgil, Lucan, etc. as being the substantial supporters of Fame. For the upper,<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>" Achilles, &gt;Eneas, Caesar, and those great Heroes, which these Poets had celebrated. All<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>44 which stood, as in massie-gold. Betweene the pillars, underneath, were figur'd Land<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>44 battailes, Sea fights, Triumphs, Loves, Sacrifices, and all magnificent subject of honour: in<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>44 bronze and heightened with silver, in which, he protest to follow the noble description, made<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>" by Chaucer, of the place. Above were sited the Masquers, over whose heads he devis'd two<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>44 eminent figures of Honour, and Virtue, for the arch. The Freezes, both below, and above,<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>44 were fill'd with several»coloured lights, like Emeralds, Rubies, Saphyres, Carbuncles, etc.<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>44 the reflexe of which, with other lights, placed in the concave, upon the Masquer's habits,<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>" was full of glory. These habits had in them the excellencie of all device, and riches, and<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>44 were worthily varied by his invention, to the nations whereof they were the Queens<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>In one of the scenes in the Lords Masque which Campion wrote and for which Inigo Jones<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>made the designs there were four life sized statues of silver 44 standing in several niches,<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>44 accompanied with ornaments of Architecture, which filled all the end of the house, and<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>i<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>44 seemed to be all of goldsmith's work. The first order consisted of pillasters all of gold, set<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>44 with Rubies, Sapphyres, Emeralds, Opals and such like. The capitals were composed of a<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>44 new invention. Over this was a bastard order with cartonses reversed, coming from the<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>44 capitals of every pilaster, which made the upper part rich and full of ornament. Over every<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>44 statue was placed a history in gold, which seemed to be of base releave, the conceits which<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>44 were figured in them were these. In the first Prometheus embossing in clay the figure of<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>44 a woman, in the second he was represented stealing fire from the chariot wheel of the<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>44 sunne, in the third he is exprest putting life with this fire into his figure of clay, and in<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>44 the fourth square Jupiter enraged, turns these new made women into statues. Above all<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>44 for finishing ran a cornish, which returned over every pillar seeming all of gold richly carved."<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>But Inigo Jones' work in connection with the Masques did not end with the designs for scenery,<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>whether buildings, landscape, or seascape. He designed also the dances, the mechanical<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>appliances and planned the stage and the seating. The Masque had a short and brilliant<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>reign. It was abandoned at the time of the Civil war not to be revived. Its fate seemed<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>\<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>intimately connected with that of Inigo Jones himself. It was introduced into England when<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>the young architect returned to his native land with Ann of Denmark, it flourished as he<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>flourished, and declined when he fell on evil days. It was a costly entertainment, but<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>from all we hear was worthy of the money spent upon it. The writers of the time who<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>mention it, all speak of it with enthusiasm. It supplied wants that we seek today, in other<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>ways, to satisfy. It gave poetry, music, scenic display and dancing. We now go to books<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>for poetry, to the opera or concert for music, to the theatre for scenic display, and to the<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>Music Hall for dancing. We specialize over much and we suffer for it. The actor is at<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>times drowned by his scenery, the dancer is almost lost in a variety entertainment, wedged<lb facs="P18_TL00046"/>in between the turn of a juggler and of a ventriloquist. But we have no performance which<lb facs="P18_TL00047"/>unites the arts and unites the audience in the same way as the Masques did. The music,<lb facs="P18_TL00048"/>the dancing, the colour of the changing scene were to the spectator as the flags and battle<lb facs="P18_TL00049"/>march of a great army. They quickened the blood, aroused the imagination, and stirred<lb facs="P18_TL00050"/>up noble thoughts, 44 for all representations "as Ben Jonson says,44 especially those of this<lb facs="P18_TL00051"/>nature....ought always to carry a mixture of profit, with them, no lesse than delight. &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00052"/>i</ab>

He tells us what Irving, Beerbohm<lb facs="P19_TL00020"/>Tree and other producers have done and then<lb facs="P19_TL00021"/>proposes to do other things, yet he does not<lb facs="P19_TL00022"/>suggest giving the entire piece another<lb facs="P19_TL00023"/>treatment; but merely varying and elaborating<lb facs="P19_TL00024"/>the treatment which now prevails.<lb facs="P19_TL00025"/>Take, for example, his passage relating to<lb facs="P19_TL00026"/>the procession of spirits in " Macbeth ". " The<lb facs="P19_TL00027"/>" very suggestion of the magic procession of<lb facs="P19_TL00028"/>" Kings impresses. It ought to be an ever<lb facs="P19_TL00029"/>" brilliant and imposing thing, the scene<lb facs="P19_TL00030"/>" changing to a glow of lights, with glitter and<lb facs="P19_TL00031"/>" effulgence. There should be music, too, as<lb facs="P19_TL00032"/>" directed ('hoboys') Yet it is always presented<lb facs="P19_TL00033"/>" in the most literal commonplace fashion. The<lb facs="P19_TL00034"/>" fellows tramp past. The figures should enter<lb facs="P19_TL00035"/>" among the trees, each after an interval...<lb facs="P19_TL00036"/>" not in a procession, as is so commonly shown,<lb facs="P19_TL00037"/>" but after pauses, with a slow and saddened<lb facs="P19_TL00038"/>" gait. They should be misty, shadowy things.<lb facs="P19_TL00039"/>" The witches then, seeing Macbeth depressed<lb facs="P19_TL00040"/>"by their show, indistinct at first, cry," Cheer<lb facs="P19_TL00041"/>"we up his spirits! Charm the air to give a<lb facs="P19_TL00042"/>" sound ", etc, on which there should be more<lb facs="P19_TL00043"/>" pleasing music, with some fantastic dancing,<lb facs="P19_TL00044"/>" at the close of which they all slowly vanish.<lb facs="P19_TL00045"/>" Cave and all might disappear, and Macbeth<lb facs="P19_TL00046"/>" be left on an open heath, as if awakened<lb facs="P19_TL00047"/>" from a dream," Now this is not "limiting";<lb facs="P19_TL00048"/>it is rather elaborating what stage managers<lb facs="P19_TL00049"/>are doing today, and this fact of itself proves<lb facs="P19_TL00050"/>the book the work of ta student, a theorist,<lb facs="P19_TL00051"/>and not of one who has had practical<lb facs="P19_TL00052"/>experience of what he teaches. Had Mr<lb facs="P19_TL00053"/>Fitzgerald practised the art of stage<lb facs="P19_TL00054"/>management, he would have discovered the<lb facs="P19_TL00055"/>very important fact which no one can discover<lb facs="P19_TL00056"/>without practise,...that the material of the<lb facs="P19_TL00057"/>theatre is already too elaborate, and that</ab>

                                       <lb facs="P19_TL00058"/>it is this material which must be simplified<lb facs="P19_TL00059"/>if simpler effects are to be produced. <lb facs="P19_TL00060"/>In his description of the opening scene of<lb facs="P19_TL00061"/>Hamlet the author again reveals the true<lb facs="P19_TL00062"/>imaginative stage director,...but he is<lb facs="P19_TL00063"/>forgetting Scene II which follows close upon<lb facs="P19_TL00064"/>Scene 1. He is therefore no practical stage<lb facs="P19_TL00065"/>director. "This Terrace", he writes,<lb facs="P19_TL00066"/>" should be a long stretch or promenade, and a<lb facs="P19_TL00067"/>" lonely one. And here is usually the mistake...<lb facs="P19_TL00068"/>" that there is little attention paid to the scale<lb facs="P19_TL00069"/>" of things, it being attempted to squeeze<lb facs="P19_TL00070"/>" into the small area all the substantial portions<lb facs="P19_TL00071"/>" of a castle. This quite dispels illusion. The<lb facs="P19_TL00072"/>" ghost might be seen coming down from a long<lb facs="P19_TL00073"/>" distance, first afar off, then drawing near<lb facs="P19_TL00074"/>" slowly and gradually, and unseen by the<lb facs="P19_TL00075"/>" officers". &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00076"/>We hope we appreciate the beauty of Mr<lb facs="P19_TL00077"/>Fitzgerald* s conception and should like to<lb facs="P19_TL00078"/>see him put it into practise, but we would<lb facs="P19_TL00079"/>remind him that swiftly upon this first scene<lb facs="P19_TL00080"/>follows the second, and if his stage be entirely<lb facs="P19_TL00081"/>occupied, as it would need to be, with this<lb facs="P19_TL00082"/>" long stretch or promenade ", where does<lb facs="P19_TL00083"/>Scene II with its thirty or forty characters<lb facs="P19_TL00084"/>come in ? The idea of a " long<lb facs="P19_TL00085"/>promenade " is remarkably picturesque; but<lb facs="P19_TL00086"/>until we know how the transition is to be<lb facs="P19_TL00087"/>made from this scene with its lonely lawn<lb facs="P19_TL00088"/>to the next one so complete a contrast....<lb facs="P19_TL00089"/>we must say that we feel it to be very<lb facs="P19_TL00090"/>unpractical.<lb facs="P19_TL00091"/>Another matter in which we are at variance<lb facs="P19_TL00092"/>with Mr Fitzgerald is with regard to his<lb facs="P19_TL00093"/>estimate of the work of Mr Gordon Craig.<lb facs="P19_TL00094"/>We wonder if he has ever read a very able<lb facs="P19_TL00095"/>paper on this subject by Mr Arthur Symons<lb facs="P19_TL00096"/>in his volume of " Studies in Seven Arts " ?<lb facs="P19_TL00097"/>The phrase in which Mr Fitzgerald's criticism<lb facs="P19_TL00098"/>of Mr Craig's scenes culminates is " They<lb facs="P19_TL00099"/>will be found monotonous ". Possibly....<lb facs="P19_TL00100"/>but whether they are or not will naturally<lb facs="P19_TL00101"/>depend upon the onlooker and Mr Fitzgerald's<lb facs="P19_TL00102"/>is the kind of criticism which is often applied<lb facs="P19_TL00103"/>to work of marked personality. Bach is " mo»<lb facs="P19_TL00104"/>notonous " to the man who prefers the<lb facs="P19_TL00105"/>" variety " of Sidney Jones: Fra Angelico<lb facs="P19_TL00106"/>is " monotonous " to one who finds relief in<lb facs="P19_TL00107"/>the volubility of Phil May. It is what they<lb facs="P19_TL00108"/>say of Irving as an actor, of Turner as a<lb facs="P19_TL00109"/>painter. " He was always Irving ", and "Well,<lb facs="P19_TL00110"/>we know what a Turner is ". But what is<lb facs="P19_TL00111"/>monotony in Art to one man is often the<lb facs="P19_TL00112"/>insistence of personality to another, and<lb facs="P19_TL00113"/>certainly in the case in question we hold the<lb facs="P19_TL00114"/>latter view. &amp; Mr Fitzgerald claims for his<lb facs="P19_TL00115"/>book that it treats of the Laws of<lb facs="P19_TL00116"/>Shakespearean Representation. We would<lb facs="P19_TL00117"/>venture to suggest, since he is interested in<lb facs="P19_TL00118"/>such matters, that he should make a careful<lb facs="P19_TL00119"/>study of the work, both practical and<lb facs="P19_TL00120"/>theoretical, of Mr Gordon Craig, who is the<lb facs="P19_TL00121"/>most serious and successful of all the seekers<lb facs="P19_TL00122"/>after those far greater Laws, the Laws of<lb facs="P19_TL00123"/>the Art ot the Theatre, and the man to<lb facs="P19_TL00124"/>whom, more than any other, we firmly believe<lb facs="P19_TL00125"/>that the Theatre of the Future will owe tsi</ab>

Yet for all that we read these<lb facs="P20_TL00020"/>Reminiscences with disappointment, coming<lb facs="P20_TL00021"/>as they do from so great an actress; because,<lb facs="P20_TL00022"/>while charming as Reminiscences, they are, as<lb facs="P20_TL00023"/>a contribution to the Art of Theatre, entirely<lb facs="P20_TL00024"/>valueless. For this is not a book for the<lb facs="P20_TL00025"/>boy or girl who is struggling to know how<lb facs="P20_TL00026"/>to do or how not to do, who is perplexed to<lb facs="P20_TL00027"/>know if to keep on with the work or give<lb facs="P20_TL00028"/>up altogether, and who, in that struggle and<lb facs="P20_TL00029"/>perplexity might naturally turn for guidance<lb facs="P20_TL00030"/>to the writings of one who has travelled the<lb facs="P20_TL00031"/>same path before. No, it is a popular book<lb facs="P20_TL00032"/>to read when in a train or a boat on the<lb facs="P20_TL00033"/>Thames. Undeniably charming, but valueless:<lb facs="P20_TL00034"/>pretty, tender, good, excruciatingly funny at<lb facs="P20_TL00035"/>times, but again,.... valueless to the Art of<lb facs="P20_TL00036"/>the Theatre. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00037"/>And it is in this that the disappointment<lb facs="P20_TL00038"/>lies. It would have been less keen if the<lb facs="P20_TL00039"/>actress had been less great. As it is we lay<lb facs="P20_TL00040"/>down these reminiscences only to wonder<lb facs="P20_TL00041"/>again, when will one of our leaders,.... that<lb facs="P20_TL00042"/>is to say, one of those old enough to know<lb facs="P20_TL00043"/>well, if not better, than any, when will one<lb facs="P20_TL00044"/>of these begin to speak the truth, whether<lb facs="P20_TL00045"/>that truth be ugly or beautiful, about the<lb facs="P20_TL00046"/>Theatre and its Art? Why the truth?<lb facs="P20_TL00047"/>Simply because it counts for so much vitality.<lb facs="P20_TL00048"/>Why not such Memoirs as these? Simply<lb facs="P20_TL00049"/>because they count for so much entertainment<lb facs="P20_TL00050"/>and no more. We have heard actors and<lb facs="P20_TL00051"/>actresses, (great actors and actresses)<lb facs="P20_TL00052"/>grumbling against books written by students<lb facs="P20_TL00053"/>of the theatre,.... books such as those by<lb facs="P20_TL00054"/>Goethe, Diderot, John Addington Symonds,<lb facs="P20_TL00055"/>G. W. Lewis, Arthur Symons, because, they<lb facs="P20_TL00056"/>say, these gentlemen are all very fine with<lb facs="P20_TL00057"/>their theories, but they have never practised<lb facs="P20_TL00058"/>anything and therefore how can they know ?<lb facs="P20_TL00059"/>Yet these actors and actresses, (great actors<lb facs="P20_TL00060"/>and actresses), never themselves trouble to<lb facs="P20_TL00061"/>write in a serious mood about the theatre,<lb facs="P20_TL00062"/>so who is to do it? Great generals have<lb facs="P20_TL00063"/>written their serious theories drawn from<lb facs="P20_TL00064"/>practise, on military tactics and other matters<lb facs="P20_TL00065"/>of value to the young soldier; painters and<lb facs="P20_TL00066"/>musicians have written seriously of their<lb facs="P20_TL00067"/>several arts: it is only the actors who have<lb facs="P20_TL00068"/>nothing for the younger generation but<lb facs="P20_TL00069"/>amusing anecdotes of their career. &amp;</ab>

                                       <lb facs="P20_TL00070"/>Perhaps one of the most serious contributions<lb facs="P20_TL00071"/>by an actor to the literature of the Art of<lb facs="P20_TL00072"/>the Theatre is Mr Beerbohm Trees's little<lb facs="P20_TL00073"/>book on " The Imaginative Faculty ", a lecture<lb facs="P20_TL00074"/>delivered at the Royal Institution, May 26,<lb facs="P20_TL00075"/>1903. We hope Mr Tree will write another<lb facs="P20_TL00076"/>h00k,.... an important one, and when he<lb facs="P20_TL00077"/>does we trust that he will find it possible to<lb facs="P20_TL00078"/>omit from his work all anecdotes. In that<lb facs="P20_TL00079"/>omission lies much of the value of his former<lb facs="P20_TL00080"/>hook. It is not occupied with chatty and<lb facs="P20_TL00081"/>amusing records of how Mr A. did this and<lb facs="P20_TL00082"/>how Mr B. did the other, and what Mr. T. said.<lb facs="P20_TL00083"/>It is on a higher plane altogether, showing<lb facs="P20_TL00084"/>that, had the author seen his way clear to<lb facs="P20_TL00085"/>working for the future of the stage,... (a thing<lb facs="P20_TL00086"/>which everybody must perceive is most<lb facs="P20_TL00087"/>necessary)... instead of producing a few plays<lb facs="P20_TL00088"/>which will have their day and be ended, he<lb facs="P20_TL00089"/>would have left a name among the great<lb facs="P20_TL00090"/>workers in the Art of the Theatre. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00091"/>Nothing spoils a book on the Art of the<lb facs="P20_TL00092"/>Stage so much as anecdotes of its actors.<lb facs="P20_TL00093"/>How unfortunate this is and how prejudicial<lb facs="P20_TL00094"/>to the interests of the Art! We do not want<lb facs="P20_TL00095"/>to be told if an actor is a good fellow or not<lb facs="P20_TL00096"/>for we know that already. What we want to<lb facs="P20_TL00097"/>learn is if he is a serious worker, how much<lb facs="P20_TL00098"/>and what kind of work he does and what is his<lb facs="P20_TL00099"/>whole intention in doing it. And then we do<lb facs="P20_TL00100"/>not want him to compare his work with that<lb facs="P20_TL00101"/>of the carpenter or some other hard worker<lb facs="P20_TL00102"/>but to compare it with the fine arts and show<lb facs="P20_TL00103"/>its relation to them. We want to see him<lb facs="P20_TL00104"/>as an artist among artists and learn his relative<lb facs="P20_TL00105"/>value. We should like to come across a<lb facs="P20_TL00106"/>book which treated of these matters, but<lb facs="P20_TL00107"/>it would take such a man many years to<lb facs="P20_TL00108"/>write it and he would have to leave the stage<lb facs="P20_TL00109"/>in order to do so, which might, ...but we must<lb facs="P20_TL00110"/>ask to be forgiven if we refuse to state<lb facs="P20_TL00111"/>the idea which has suggested itself during<lb facs="P20_TL00112"/>the writing of this last paragraph! &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00113"/>To return, however, to the present chapter<lb facs="P20_TL00114"/>of Miss Terry's Memoirs.

Pleasure by your noble<lb facs="P20_TL00119"/>44 and sincere art pain because I feel sad<lb facs="P20_TL00120"/>" at heart when I see a beautiful and generous<lb facs="P20_TL00121"/>44 woman give her soul to art as you do<lb facs="P20_TL00122"/>" when it is life itself, your heart itself,<lb facs="P20_TL00123"/>" that speaks tenderly, sorrowfully, nobly<lb facs="P20_TL00124"/>44 beneath your acting. I cannot rid myself<lb facs="P20_TL00125"/>44 of a certain melancholy when 1 see artists<lb facs="P20_TL00126"/>44 as noble and distinguished as you and Mr<lb facs="P20_TL00127"/>44 Irving. Although you are strong enough<lb facs="P20_TL00128"/>44 (with continual labor) to make life<lb facs="P20_TL00129"/>44 subservient to art, I, from my standpoint,<lb facs="P20_TL00130"/>44 regard you as forces of nature itself, which<lb facs="P20_TL00131"/>44 should have the right to exist for themselves<lb facs="P20_TL00132"/>44 instead of for the crowd. I would not venture<lb facs="P20_TL00133"/>44 to disturb you, Madame, and moreover 1<lb facs="P20_TL00134"/>44 have so much to do that it is impossible<lb facs="P20_TL00135"/>44 for me to tell you personally all the great<lb facs="P20_TL00136"/>44 pleasure you have given me, because I<lb facs="P20_TL00137"/>44 have felt your heart.

It is a<lb facs="P21_TL00013"/>matter of focus, and naturally results from<lb facs="P21_TL00014"/>regarding scenes and events through the<lb facs="P21_TL00015"/>temperament rather than through the<lb facs="P21_TL00016"/>imagination. On a later page is given the<lb facs="P21_TL00017"/>following letter, written from Oxford to<lb facs="P21_TL00018"/>Miss Terry by Henry Irving.<lb facs="P21_TL00019"/>441 had supper last night at New College<lb facs="P21_TL00020"/>44 after the affair. A. was there, and I had<lb facs="P21_TL00021"/>44 it out with him to the delight of all.<lb facs="P21_TL00022"/>44 4 Too much decoration % etc., etc. &amp; 1<lb facs="P21_TL00023"/>44 asked him what there was in 44 Faust" in the<lb facs="P21_TL00024"/>44 matter of appointments, etc., that he would<lb facs="P21_TL00025"/>44 like left out. Answer nothing. &amp; 4 Too<lb facs="P21_TL00026"/>44 long runs.' &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00027"/>44 4 You, sir, are a poet,' I said. 4 Perhaps it<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>44 may be my privilege some day to produce<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>44 a play of yours. Would you like it to have<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>44 a long run or a short one?' (Roars of<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>44 laughter). &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>44 Answer: 4 Well, er, well, of course, Mr<lb facs="P21_TL00033"/>44 Irving, you well well, a short run, of<lb facs="P21_TL00034"/>44 course, for arf, but \ 4?<lb facs="P21_TL00035"/>44 4 Now, sir, you're on oath,' said 1. 4 Suppose<lb facs="P21_TL00036"/>44 that the fees were rolling in ten pounds and<lb facs="P21_TL00037"/>44 more a night would you rather the play<lb facs="P21_TL00038"/>44 were a failure or a success? ' &lt;£?<lb facs="P21_TL00039"/>44 4 Well, well, as you put it, I must say —er<lb facs="P21_TL00040"/>44 1 would rather my play had a long<lb facs="P21_TL00041"/>44 run I' A. floored! &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00042"/>44 He has all his life been writing articles<lb facs="P21_TL00043"/>44 running down good work and crying up the<lb facs="P21_TL00044"/>44 impossible, and I was glad to show him up<lb facs="P21_TL00045"/>44 a bit!<lb facs="P21_TL00046"/>&amp; What a strange attitude! Is it typical of the<lb facs="P21_TL00047"/>English stage? Is it typical of the English<lb facs="P21_TL00048"/>nation? Is it typical of commerce? It is<lb facs="P21_TL00049"/>certainly not typical of anything to do with<lb facs="P21_TL00050"/>Artists and their work. Who, one wonders,<lb facs="P21_TL00051"/>was this poet at Oxford who fell so easy a<lb facs="P21_TL00052"/>prey to the celebrated Actor=Manager? who<lb facs="P21_TL00053"/>was this twopenny gentleman who is brought<lb facs="P21_TL00054"/>forward as the type of all poets and who yet<lb facs="P21_TL00055"/>began to hum and haw as soon as money<lb facs="P21_TL00056"/>was mentioned?... for the word 44 money „<lb facs="P21_TL00057"/>is a Shiboleth, and the way it is pronounced<lb facs="P21_TL00058"/>shows unmistakeably the quality of the man.<lb facs="P21_TL00059"/>If taken seriously, the whole thing was very<lb facs="P21_TL00060"/>unworthy of Irving. One sees him in the<lb facs="P21_TL00061"/>guise of the Actor« Manager, trying to prove<lb facs="P21_TL00062"/>the very unimportant and unreliable fact<lb facs="P21_TL00063"/>that the public is an ass and that those who<lb facs="P21_TL00064"/>truckle to the public are greater asses. He<lb facs="P21_TL00065"/>proves his point up to the hilt, therefore he<lb facs="P21_TL00066"/>also proves the rule that Poets are not fools,<lb facs="P21_TL00067"/>for this must have been an exceptional<lb facs="P21_TL00068"/>poet.... but he does not mention the name<lb facs="P21_TL00069"/>of the poet. We hardly think that, had he met</ab>

After all, where the actor<lb facs="P21_TL00074"/>manager goes poets and artists ars not often<lb facs="P21_TL00075"/>to be found, so it is not surprising that he<lb facs="P21_TL00076"/>shows himself ignorant of the real nature of<lb facs="P21_TL00077"/>the artist since he so seldom comes across<lb facs="P21_TL00078"/>one in his travels. <lb facs="P21_TL00079"/>We have said before that the publi<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

As<lb facs="P21_TL00083"/>the Memoirs of the most popular actress in<lb facs="P21_TL00084"/>England they will afford entertainment to<lb facs="P21_TL00085"/>many; and by the way in which they imply<lb facs="P21_TL00086"/>and reveal the narrowness of the theatrical<lb facs="P21_TL00087"/>brain, the limitations of the theatrical outlook,<lb facs="P21_TL00088"/>they will, also unwittingly, help the Art itself.<lb facs="P21_TL00089"/>How? Why, because the younger men,<lb facs="P21_TL00090"/>reading these pages, will feel more insistently<lb facs="P21_TL00091"/>than before the imperative need of escaping<lb facs="P21_TL00092"/>from the triviality of the stage world, from<lb facs="P21_TL00093"/>the artificiality of its atmosphere. The stage<lb facs="P21_TL00094"/>world as drawn by Miss Terry would not be<lb facs="P21_TL00095"/>a tiny one for a public person but it is a<lb facs="P21_TL00096"/>tiny one for an Artist.... and it is artists<lb facs="P21_TL00097"/>that the theatre needs. The world of the<lb facs="P21_TL00098"/>Stage is one in which men may crawl or<lb facs="P21_TL00099"/>climb, but never fly. The Art of the theatre<lb facs="P21_TL00100"/>is the only art which exists in such an<lb facs="P21_TL00101"/>atmosphere. All the others spread their<lb facs="P21_TL00102"/>wings. But discontent with existing conditions<lb facs="P21_TL00103"/>is a necessary prelude to their reformation,<lb facs="P21_TL00104"/>and it is in arousing this discontent in the<lb facs="P21_TL00105"/>younger workers in the theatre that Miss<lb facs="P21_TL00106"/>Terry's memoirs will be of service to the<lb facs="P21_TL00107"/>Art. &amp; &amp;</ab>

We believe<lb facs="P22_TL00095"/>that his 44 Richard 111 " would be the best role<lb facs="P22_TL00096"/>in which he could make his first essay and<lb facs="P22_TL00097"/>appearance as an actor in English. 44 King<lb facs="P22_TL00098"/>Lear " is a play which the English publics are<lb facs="P22_TL00099"/>never too ready to welcome. Henry Irving's<lb facs="P22_TL00100"/>unforgettable interpretation of 44 Lear " was<lb facs="P22_TL00101"/>received with the respect which Irving could<lb facs="P22_TL00102"/>always command, but the play was by no<lb facs="P22_TL00103"/>means as successful as were the other<lb facs="P22_TL00104"/>tragedies.

She has that in her<lb facs="P23_TL00004"/>grasp, which must ever be the essence of<lb facs="P23_TL00005"/>any Art. . . Suggestion . . . the instrument<lb facs="P23_TL00006"/>through which is transmitted an impression<lb facs="P23_TL00007"/>so various and vast as the intelligences that<lb facs="P23_TL00008"/>absorb it.

She bends her whole personality to<lb facs="P23_TL00013"/>this, and there are times when with eyes<lb facs="P23_TL00014"/>staring wide, one loses the woman and sees<lb facs="P23_TL00015"/>the greater mentality... the real Mrs. Fiske.<lb facs="P23_TL00016"/>Her thought is fluid, absolutely; she is not<lb facs="P23_TL00017"/>of the wooden school: a quick little turn of<lb facs="P23_TL00018"/>the head, an inscrutable expression that<lb facs="P23_TL00019"/>might as well be a mask, and a thought is<lb facs="P23_TL00020"/>whirled into space, trailing behind, a shower<lb facs="P23_TL00021"/>of terribly clear reasons. She makes of<lb facs="P23_TL00022"/>herself no emotional barometer, but with a<lb facs="P23_TL00023"/>sweet dignity that must seem wearisome to<lb facs="P23_TL00024"/>the commonplace, keeps sanely within the<lb facs="P23_TL00025"/>frame: and by so slight a thing as a nervous<lb facs="P23_TL00026"/>little gesture, can she swing, as on a pivot,<lb facs="P23_TL00027"/>the fatality of the drama.... her accent is<lb facs="P23_TL00028"/>infallible. jg? &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00029"/>It would be interesting to see what Mrs. Fiske,<lb facs="P23_TL00030"/>with her tremendous peculiar power, could<lb facs="P23_TL00031"/>do in collaboration with the mystic art of<lb facs="P23_TL00032"/>Gordon Craig. I see her take her place with<lb facs="P23_TL00033"/>the Idea, saying silently such lofty meanings<lb facs="P23_TL00034"/>that words would drag in the dust, for her<lb facs="P23_TL00035"/>silence can be terrible: her silence can be<lb facs="P23_TL00036"/>beautiful: she knows the wisdom of silence.<lb facs="P23_TL00037"/>&amp; Yet this wonderful woman has had thrust<lb facs="P23_TL00038"/>upon her what all distinctive idealists must<lb facs="P23_TL00039"/>ever suffer; ridicule, contempt, a clattering<lb facs="P23_TL00040"/>fusillade against her personality, closed doors<lb facs="P23_TL00041"/>and press comments of vile odour. But like<lb facs="P23_TL00042"/>distinctive idealists, she has gone her straight<lb facs="P23_TL00043"/>road alone, or nearly so, for there are<lb facs="P23_TL00044"/>always the few who cling fearfully, and<lb facs="P23_TL00045"/>hopefully; to a slight thread. &lt;£? &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00046"/>After many years she stands a supreme figure<lb facs="P23_TL00047"/>in the Stage history of America. If she must<lb facs="P23_TL00048"/>step down several steps one season, let there<lb facs="P23_TL00049"/>be no fear, she will but rise to a<lb facs="P23_TL00050"/>greater height the following. She fights a<lb facs="P23_TL00051"/>terrible beast, the Public, and realizing the<lb facs="P23_TL00052"/>pathetic necessity of subtleties, never comes<lb facs="P23_TL00053"/>entirely to the level of the beast: she is ever<lb facs="P23_TL00054"/>a discreet trifle above, and it is the beast<lb facs="P23_TL00055"/>that is slowly being attracted up the stair.</ab>

In godlike ecstasy they leap from the ground; the poor, the hungering, the<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>bowed by misery, are they no longer; proudly they raise themselves erect, inspiration<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>shines from their ennobled faces, a radiant light streams from their eyes, and with the<lb facs="P7_TL00046"/>heaven-shaking cry, I am a man! the millions, the embodied Revolution, the Qod become<lb facs="P7_TL00047"/>Man, rush down to the valleys and plains, and proclaim to all the world, the new gospel of<lb facs="P7_TL00048"/>Happiness." j® j® &amp; &amp; Richard Wagner.<lb facs="P7_TL00049"/>I wonder if the ladies and gentlemen who patronize the Opera Houses of Europe and America<lb facs="P7_TL00050"/>*■<lb facs="P7_TL00051"/>realise what they are listening to when Wagner lets loose the notes of his soul in the great<lb facs="P7_TL00052"/>operas....

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00002"/>pleadings they yawningly listen. &amp; Surely there must be some mistake. &amp; ** With works of<lb facs="P8_TL00003"/>Art, as with Royalty, you have to wait until they speak to you before you can respond.<lb facs="P8_TL00004"/>so wrote a charming lady to me today. Is it possible that Royalty could have ever heard the<lb facs="P8_TL00005"/>voice of Wagner aright. Is it possible that we have seen Royalty applauding the operas of<lb facs="P8_TL00006"/>Wagner,... Monarchs applauding the Apostle of Revolution? Is it to be made inevitable that<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>the artists must enter the field of Politics, or lean fanatically from the pulpit? Is this to be<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>forced upon them ? In the old times the artist was content..,, stood by.... watched the crowd,<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>sketched the crowns, the swords and the spades..., recorded the sights and the sounds of<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>his time,,., added the note of love to it all, and left it as his legacy to the following century,<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>&amp; Is the artist to be changed? Is a discontent to be roused in him? Is his labour to be<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>respected or is he for ever to starve, is he for ever to be asked to compromise as the only<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>condition on which his country will listen to him? If this is so, then I fear that the far<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>off likelihood of the artist finding comradeship with the Revolutionary is nearer probability<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>than we must hope. &amp; Remember, the artists have ever loved and fought for King and<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>Royalty. And Royalty provided for these sons in the olden days,,., provided the means of<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>life,.,, and what is far more important, the recognition of Art as a factor in Life, the<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>recognition of the liberties of the Artist. &amp; It would be curiously interesting to know how<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>many men today are following the profession of artist. They must number at least three<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>million,,.. and the force of three million men of the calibre of the artist is not a thing to<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>forget when reckoning the chances and changes of the State. We see also how the artist<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>feels about things, " 1 will destroy the existing order of things which parts this one mankind<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>into hostile nations, etc. etc. " He positively feels that lie too, is a privileged being and<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>can alter things for better or worse: that he is no less a force than a Prime Minister, and<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>he even becomes an Autocrat at times. Two questions still remain to be answered. Do<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>Beethoven, Wagner, Strauss, Plato, Shakespeare, Shelley, Blake, Goethe, Rousseau, Nietzsche<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>Raphael, Leonardo Velasquez, Van Dyke, really count as a force? Have they had any<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>influence on people and things? &amp; If the answer is in the affirmative, then why does the<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>persecution of all modern artists continue? why but quite recently should the voice of<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>Blake, Shelley, Wagner, Nietzsche, Rousseau, Beethoven and Strauss be raised with the cry<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>above quoted of, "I., will destroy the existing order of things." It is an unwise police to<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>disregard the Ideal for which all artists live,... the freedom of their Art, and the recognition<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>,of its power. It would be a wise policy to further that Ideal. &amp; It would also be an<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>interesting task for some leader to organize all the European and American artists in a<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>body.... Curiously enough perhaps we should then hear less about Revolution.... Three</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>jt has always been a matter for argument whether or no Acting is an art, and therefore<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>whether the actor is an Artist, or something quite different, There is little to show us<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>that this question disturbed the minds of the leaders of thought at any period, though there<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>is much evidence to prove that had they chosen to approach this subject as one for their<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>serious consideration, they would have applied to it the same method of enquiry as used<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>when considering the arts of Music and Poetry, of Architecture, Sculpture and Painting.<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>On the other hand theref have been many warm arguments in certain circles on this<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>• topic. Those taking part in it have seldom been actors, very rarely men of the theatre<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>at all, and all have displayed any amount of illogical heat, and very little knowledge of the<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>subject. The arguments against acting being an art, and against the actor being an artist,<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>are generally so unreasonable and so personal in their detestation of the actor, that I think<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>it is for this reason the actors have taken no trouble to go into the matter. So now -<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>regularly with each season comes the quarterly attack on the actor and on his jolly calling;<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>the attack usually ending in the retirement of the enemy. As a rule it is the literary or<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>private gentlemen who fill the enemy's rank. On the strength of having gone to see plays<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>all their lives, or on the strength of never having gone to see a play in their lives, they<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>attack for spine reason best known to themselves. 1 have followed these regular attacks<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>S<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>season by season, and they seem mostly to spring from irritability, personal enmity or<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>conceit.... They are, illogical from beginning to end.... There can be no such attack<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>made on the actor or his calling. My intention here is not to join in any such attempt;<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>1 would merely place before, you what seem to me. to be the logical facts of a curious case,<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>and I believe that these admit of no dispute whatever. . &amp; &amp; .<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>Acting is not an art. It is therefore incorrect to speak of the actor as an artist. For<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>accident is an enemy of the artist. &amp; Art is the exact antithisis of Pandimonium, and<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>Pandimonium is created by the tumbling together of many accidents; Art arrives .only by<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>design. Therefore in order to make any work of art it is clear we may only work in those<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>V * - - * ( ■ J? ' \<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>materials with which cap calculate.

The. actions of the actor's body, the expression of his face, the sounds<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>of his voice, all are at the mercy of the winds of his emotions; these winds which must blow<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

But with the actor, emotion<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>possesses him; it seizes upon Jiis limbs moving them whither it will. He is at its beck and<lb facs="P9_TL00042"/>call, he moves as one in av frantic dream or as one distraught, swaying here and there; his<lb facs="P9_TL00043"/>head, his arms, his feet, if not utterly beyond control, are so weak to stand against the torrent<lb facs="P9_TL00044"/>of his passions, that they are ready to play him false at any moment. It is useless for<lb facs="P9_TL00045"/>him to attempt to reason with himself.... Hamlet's calm directions (the dreamer's not the<lb facs="P9_TL00046"/>logician's directions, by the way) are thrown to the winds. His limbs refuse, and refuse</ab>

As with his movement, so is it with the<lb facs="P10_TL00007"/>expression of his face. The mind struggling and succeeding for a moment, in moving the<lb facs="P10_TL00008"/>eyes, or the muscles of the face whither it will;... the mind bringing the face for a few<lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>moments into thorough subjection, is suddenly swept aside by the emotion which has grown<lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>hot through the action of the mind. Instantly, like lightening, and before the mind has<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>time to cry out and protest, the hot passion has mastered the actor's expression. It shifts<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>and changes, sways and turns, it is chased by emotion from the actor's forehead between<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>his and down to his mouth; now he is entirely at the mercy of emotion, and crying<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>out to it: "Do with me what you will!" his expression runs a mad riot hither and thither,<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>and lo! " nothing is coming of nothing. " It is the same with his voice as it is with his<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>movements. Emotion cracks the voice of the actor. It sways his voice to join in the<lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>conspiracy against his mind. Emotion works upon the voice of the actor, and he produces....<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>the impression of discordant emotion. It is of no avail to say that emotion is the spirit<lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>of the gods and is precisely what the artist aims to produce; first of all this is not true,<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>and even if it were quite true, every stray emotion, every casual feeling, cannot be of<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>Value. Therefore the mind of the actor, we see, is less powerful that his emotion, for<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>emotion is able to win over the mind to assist in the destruction of that which the mind<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>Would produce; and as the mind becomes the slave of the emotion it follows that accident<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>upon accident must be continually occurring. So then, we have arrived to this point;....<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>that emotion is the cause which first of all creates, and secondly destroys. Art as we have<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>said, can admit of no accidents. That then which the actor gives us, is not a work of art;<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>it is a series accidental confessions. &amp; In the beginning the human body was not used as<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>material in the art of the theatre. In the beginning the emotions of men and women were<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>not considered as a fit exhibition for the multitude. An elephant and a tiger in an arena<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>suited the taste better, when the desire was to excite. The passionate tussle between the<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>elephant and the tiger gives us all the excitement that we can get from the modern stage,<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>and can give it us unalloyed. Such an exhibition is not more brutal, it is more delicate;<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>it is more humane; for there is nothing more outrageous than that men and women shoudl<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>be let loose on a platform, so that they may expose that which artists refuse to show except<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>veiled, in the form which their minds create. How it was that man was ever persuaded<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>to take the place which until that time animals had held Is not difficult to surmise. <lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>The man with the greater learning comes across the man with the greater temperament.<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>He addresses him in something like the following terms :... 44 You have a most superb<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>countenance; what magnificent movements you make! Your voice, it is like the singing of<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>birds; and how your eye flashes! What a noble impression you give! You almost resemble<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>a god! 1 think all people should have pointed out to them this wonder which is contained<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>in you. I will write a few words which you shall address to the people. You shall stand<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>before them, and you shall speak my lines just as you will. It is sure to be perfectly right.,r<lb facs="P10_TL00044"/>And the man of temperament replies; "Is that really so? Do I strike you as appearing<lb facs="P10_TL00045"/>as a god? It is the very first time I have ever thought of it. And do you think that by appearing<lb facs="P10_TL00046"/>v..<lb facs="P10_TL00047"/>in front of the people I could make an impression which might benefit them, and would<lb facs="P10_TL00048"/>fill them with enthusiasm? " No, no, no, " says the intelligent man; 44 by no means only<lb facs="P10_TL00049"/>by appearing; but if you have something to say you will indeed create a great impression. "<lb facs="P10_TL00050"/>■j&amp; The other answers, " I think 1 shall have some difficulty in speaking your lines. I could<lb facs="P10_TL00051"/>easier just appear, and say, something instinctive, such as 4 Salutation to all men I feel<lb facs="P10_TL00052"/>perhaps that I should be able to be more myself if I acted in that way. " " That is an<lb facs="P10_TL00053"/>excellent idea, " replies the tempter, 44 that idea of yours,4 Salutation to all men. * On that<lb facs="P10_TL00054"/>theme I will compose say one hundred or two hundred lines; you'll be the very man to<lb facs="P10_TL00055"/>speak those lines. You have yourself suggested it to me. Salutation! Is it agreed then,<lb facs="P10_TL00056"/>that you will do this? " 44 If you wish it, " replies the other, with a good-natured lack of<lb facs="P10_TL00057"/>reason, and flattered beyond measure. &amp; jp<lb facs="P10_TL00058"/>And so the comedy of author and actor commences. The young man appears before the<lb facs="P10_TL00059"/>multitude and speaks the lines, and the speaking of them is a superb advertisement for<lb facs="P10_TL00060"/>the art of literature. After the applause the young man is swiftly forgotten; they even forgive<lb facs="P10_TL00061"/>the way he has spoken the lines; but as it was an original and new idea at the time, the<lb facs="P10_TL00062"/>author found it profitable, and shortly afterwards other authors found It an excellent thing</ab>

It mattered nothing to them that the<lb facs="P11_TL00003"/>instrument was a human creature. Although they knew not the stops of the instrument,<lb facs="P11_TL00004"/>they could play rudely upon him and they found him useful. &amp; And so to-day we have the<lb facs="P11_TL00005"/>strange picture of a man content to give forth the thoughts of another, which that other has<lb facs="P11_TL00006"/>given form to, while at the same time he exhibits his person to the public view. He does it<lb facs="P11_TL00007"/>because he is flattered,—and vanity—will not reason. But all the time, and however long<lb facs="P11_TL00008"/>the world may last, the nature in man will fight for freedom, and will revolt against being<lb facs="P11_TL00009"/>made a slave or medium for the expression of another's thoughts. The whole thing is a very<lb facs="P11_TL00010"/>grave matter indeed, and it is no good to push it aside and protest that the actor is not the<lb facs="P11_TL00011"/>medium for another's thoughts, and that he invests with Life the dead words of an author;<lb facs="P11_TL00012"/>because even if this were true (true it cannot be) and even if the actor was to present none<lb facs="P11_TL00013"/>but the ideas which he himself should compose, his nature would still be in servitude; his<lb facs="P11_TL00014"/>body would have to become the slave of his mind; and that as I have shown is what the<lb facs="P11_TL00015"/>healthy body utterly refuses to do. &amp; Therefore the body of man, for the reason which I have<lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>given, is by nature utterly useless as a material for an art. Iam fully aware of the sweeping<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>charater of this statement, and as it concerns men and women who are alive and who as a<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>class are ever to be loved, more must be said lest 1 give unintentional offence. &lt;£? 1 know<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>perfectly well that what 1 have said here is not yet going to create an exodus of all the actors<lb facs="P11_TL00020"/>from all the theatres in the world, driving them into sad monasteries where they will laugh out<lb facs="P11_TL00021"/>the rest of their lives, with the Art of the Theatre as the main topic for amusing conversation.<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>As 1 have written elsewhere, the theatre will continue its growth and actors will continue<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>for some years to hinder its development. But 1 see a loop-hole by which in time the<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>actors can escape from the bondage they are in. They must create for themselves a new<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>form of acting, consisting for the main part of symbolical gesture. To-day they impersonate<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>nnd interpret; to-morrow they must represent and interpret; and the third day they must<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>create. By this means style may returu. To-day the actor impersonates a certain being.<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>He cries to the audience " Watch me; I am now prentending to be so and so, and I am now<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>pretending to do so and so; " and then he proceeds to imitate as exactly as possible, that<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>Which he has announced he will indicate. For instance, he is Romeo. He tells the audience<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>tfyat he is in love, and he proceeds to show it, by kissing Juliet. This, it is claimed is a<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>work of Art: it is claimed for this that it is an intelligent way of suggesting thought. &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>tytyy...., why, that is just as if a painter were to draw upon the wall a picture of an animal<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>With Jopg ears, and then write under it • This is a donkey.' The long ears made it plain<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>aiiough one would think, without the inscription, and any child of ten does as much. The<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>difference befween the child of ten and the artist is, that the. artist is he who by drawing<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>certain signs and shapes creates the impression of a donkey; and the greater artist is he<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>who creates the impression of the whole genus of donkey, the spirit of the thing. <lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>&amp; The actor looks upon life as a photo-machine looks upon life; and he attempts to make<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>arj&gt;ipture to rival a photpgraph. He never dreams of his art as being an art such for instance<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>as music. He tries to reproduce nature; he seldom thinks to invent with the aid of nature,<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>$pd he never dreams of creating. As I have said, the best he can do when he wants to<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>OPtch and convey the poetry of a kiss, the heat of a fight, or the calm of death, is to copy<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>slavishly, photographically.... he kisses.... he fights.... he lies back and mimics death,... and<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>Wfren ypu think of it, is not all this dreadfully stupid? Is it not a poor art and a poor<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>Cleverness, which cannot convey the spirit and essence of an idea to an audience, but can<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>pfily Show,an artless copy, a facsimile of the thing itself. This is to be an Imitator not<lb facs="P11_TL00048"/>Artist. This is to claim kinship with the Ventriloquist, (i) £&gt;<lb facs="P11_TL00049"/>There is a stage expression of the actor "getting under the skin of the part.

                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00005"/>in relation with the idea of art. The painter means something rather different to actuality<lb facs="P12_TL00006"/>when he speaks of Life in his art, and the other artists generally mean something essentially<lb facs="P12_TL00007"/>spiritual; it is only the actor the ventriloquist or the animal-stuffer who, when they speak<lb facs="P12_TL00008"/>of putting life into their work, mean some actual and lifelike reproduction, something blatant<lb facs="P12_TL00009"/>in its appeal, that it is for this reason I say that it wrould be better if the actor should get<lb facs="P12_TL00010"/>out of the skin of the part altogether. If there is any actor who is reading this, is there<lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>not some way by which I can make him realise the preposterous absurdity of this delusion<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>of his, this belief that he should aim to make an actual copy, a reproduction ? Iam going<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>to suppose that such an actor is here with me as I talk; and I invite a musician and a<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>painter to join us. Let them speak. I have had enough of seeming to decry the work of<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>the actor from trivial motives. I have spoken this way because of my love of the theatre,<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>and because of my hopes and belief that before long an extraordinary development is to<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>raise and revive that which is failing in the theatre, and my hope and belief that the actor<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>will bring the force of his courage to assist in this revival. My attitude towards the<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>whole matter is misunderstood by many in the Theatre. It is considered to be my attitude,<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>mine alone; a stray quarreller I seem to be in their eyes, a pessimist, grumbling; one who<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>is tired of a thing and who attempts to break it. Therefore let the other artists speak<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>with the actor, and let the actor support his own case as best he may, and let him listen<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>to their opinion on matters of art. We sit here conversing, the actor, the musician, the<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>painter and myself. I who represent an art distinct from all these, shall remain silent.<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>&amp;As we sit here, the talk first turns upon Nature. We are surrounded by beautiful<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>curving hills, trees, vast and towering mountains in the distance covered with snow; around<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>us innumerable delicate sounds of nature stirring... Life. 44 How beautiful, " says the<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>painter, 44 how beatutiful the sense of all this! " He is dreaming of the almost impossibility<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>of conveying the full earthly and spiritual value of that which is around him on to his<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>canvas, yet he faces the thing as man generally faces that which is most dangerous. &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>&amp; The musician gazes upon the ground. The actor's is an inward and personal gaze at<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>himself. He is unconsciously enjoying the sense of himself, as representing the main and<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>central figure in a really good scene. He strides across the space between us and the view,<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>sweeping in a half circle, and he regards the superb panorama without seeing it, conscious<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>of one thing only, himself and his attitude. Of course an actress would stand there<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>meek in the presence of nature. She is but a little thing, a little picturesque atom;... for<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>picturesque we know she is in every movement, in the sigh which, almost unheard by the<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>rest of us, she conveys to her audience and to herself, that she is there 44 littie me, " in<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>the presence of the God that made her!! and all the rest of the sentimental nonsense.<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>So we are all collected here, and having taken the attitudes natural to us, we proceed to<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>question each other. And let us imagine that for once we are all really interested in<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>finding out all about the other's interests, and the other's work. (I grant that this is very<lb facs="P12_TL00043"/>unusual, and that mind-selfishness, the highest form of stupidity, encloses many a professed<lb facs="P12_TL00044"/>artist somewhat tightly in a little square box.) But let us take it for granted that there<lb facs="P12_TL00045"/>is a general interest; that the actor and the musician wish to learn something about the<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>art of painting; and that the painter and the musician wish to understand from the actor<lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>what his work consists of and whether and why he considers it an art. For here they<lb facs="P12_TL00048"/>shall not mince matters, but shall speak that which they believe. As they are looking only<lb facs="P12_TL00049"/>for the truth, they have nothing to fear; they are all good fellows, all good friends; not<lb facs="P12_TL00050"/>thin skinned, and can give and take blows. &amp; 44 Tell us, " asks the painter, 44 is it true<lb facs="P12_TL00051"/>that before you can act a part properly you must feel the emotions of the character ybu<lb facs="P12_TL00052"/>are representing?" Oh well, yes and no; it depends what you mean," answers the<lb facs="P12_TL00053"/>actor. ** We have first to be able to feel and sympathise and also criticise the emotions<lb facs="P12_TL00054"/>of a character; we look at it from a distance before we close with it: we gather as mueh<lb facs="P12_TL00055"/>as we can from the text and we call to mind all the emotions suitable for this character to<lb facs="P12_TL00056"/>exhibit. After having many times rearranged and selected those emotions which we consider<lb facs="P12_TL00057"/>of importance we then practice to reproduce them before the audience; and in order to do<lb facs="P12_TL00058"/>so we must feel as little as is necessary; in fact the less we feel, the firmer will our hold<lb facs="P12_TL00059"/>be upon our facial and bodily expression. " &amp; With a gesture of genial impatence, the artist<lb facs="P12_TL00060"/>rises to his feet and paces to and fro. He had expected his friend to say that it had nothing<lb facs="P12_TL00061"/>whatever to do with emotions, and that he could control his face, features, voice and all,</ab>

The musician sinks down deeper into his chair.<lb facs="P13_TL00003"/>" But has there never been an actor, " asks the artist, 44 who has so trained his body from<lb facs="P13_TL00004"/>head to foot that it would answer to the workings of his mind without permitting the<lb facs="P13_TL00005"/>emotions even so much as to awaken? Surely there must have been one actor, say one<lb facs="P13_TL00006"/>out of ten million, who has done this ? " 44 No, " says the actor emphatically, 44 never,<lb facs="P13_TL00007"/>never; there never has been an actor who reached such a state of mechanical perfection<lb facs="P13_TL00008"/>that his body was absolutelyr the slave of his mind. Edmund Kean of England, Salvini of<lb facs="P13_TL00009"/>Italy, Rachel, Eleonora Duse, 1 call them all to mind and 1 repeat there never was an actor<lb facs="P13_TL00010"/>or actress such as you describe. " &amp; The artist here asks, 44 Then you admit that it would<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>be a state of perfection?" &amp; 44 Why of course! But it is impossible; will always be<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>impossible, " cries the actor; and he rises.... almost with a sense of relief. £/ 44 That is as<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>much as to say, there never was a perfect actor, there has never been an actor who has<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>not spoiled his performance once, twice, ten times, sometimes a hundred times during the<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>evening? There never has been a piece of acting which could be called even almost perfect<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>and there never will be? " For answer the actor asks quickly,44 But has there been ever<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>a painting, or a piece of architecture, or a piece of music which may be called <lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>"Undoubtedly," they reply, 44 The laws which control our arts make such a thing possible."<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>44 A picture for instance, " continues the artist, 44 may consist of four lines, or four<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>hundred lines, placed in certain positions; it may be as simple as possible, but it is<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>possible to make it perfect. That is to say, 1 can first choose that which is to njake<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>the lines; 1 can choose that on which 1 am to place the lines: 1 can consider this as long<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>as 1 like; 1 can alter it; then in a state which is both free from excitement, haste, trouble,<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>nervousness, in fact in any state 1 choose, (and of course 1 prepare, wait and select<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>that also) 1 can put these lines together.... so.... now they are in their place. Having my<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>material nothing except my own will can move or alter these; and as I have said my own<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>will is entirely under my control. The line can be straight or it can wave; it can be round<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>if 1 choose, and there is no fear that when 1 wish to make a straight line 1 shall make a<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>curved one, or that when 1 wish to make a curved there will be square parts about it.<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>And when it is ready.... finished.... it undergoes no change but that which Time, who finally<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>destroys it, wills." "That is rather an extraordinary thing, " replied the actor. 441 wish<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>it was possible in my work." 44 Yes," replies the artist, %i it is a very extraordinary<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>thing, and it is that which I hold makes the difference between an intelligent statement<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>and a casual or haphazard statement. The most intelligent statement, that is a work of art.<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>The haphazard statement, that is a work of chance. When the intelligent statement reaches<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>its highest possible form it becomes a work of fine art. And therefore 1 have always held,<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>though 1 may be mistaken, that your work has not the nature of an art. That is to say (and<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>you have said it yourself) each statement that you make in your work is subject to every<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>conceivable change which emotion chooses to bring about. That which you conceive in your<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>mind, your body is not permitted by nature to complete. In fact, your body, gaining the<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>better of your intelligence, has in many instances on the stage driven out the intelligence<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>altogether. Some actors seem to say, 44 What value lies in having beautiful ideas. To what<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>end shall my mind conceive a fine idea, a fine thought, for my body which is so entirely<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>beyond my control to spoil? I will throw my mind overboard, let my body pull me and<lb facs="P13_TL00045"/>the play through; " and there seems to me to be some wisdom in the standpoint of such<lb facs="P13_TL00046"/>an actor. He does not dilly dally between the two things which are contending in him, the<lb facs="P13_TL00047"/>one against the other. He is not a bit afraid of the result. He goes at it like a man,<lb facs="P13_TL00048"/>sometimes a trifle too like a centaur; he flings away all science.... all caution.... all reason<lb facs="P13_TL00049"/>and the result is good spirits in the audence,... and for that they pay willingly. But we<lb facs="P13_TL00050"/>are here talking about other things than excellent spirits, and though we applaud the actor<lb facs="P13_TL00051"/>who exhibits such a personality as this, I feel that we must not forget that we are applauding<lb facs="P13_TL00052"/>his personality... he it is we applaud, not what he is doing or how he is doing it; nothing<lb facs="P13_TL00053"/>to do with art at all, absolutely nothing to do with art, with calculation, or design. <lb facs="P13_TL00054"/>44 You're a nice friendly creature, " laughs the actor gaily, 44 telling me my art's no art!<lb facs="P13_TL00055"/>But I believe 1 see what you mean. You mean to say that before I appear on the stage and<lb facs="P13_TL00056"/>before my body commences to come into the question, 1 am an artist. " &amp; 44 Well yes, you<lb facs="P13_TL00057"/>are, you happen to be, because you are a very bad actor; you're abominable on the stage,<lb facs="P13_TL00058"/>but you have ideas, you have imagination; you are rather an exception 1 should say.</ab>

For you would not only have dreamt, you would have executed to perfection;<lb facs="P14_TL00013"/>and that which you had executed could be repeated time after time without so much<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>difference as between two farthings. 44 Ah, " sighs the actor, 44 you place a terrible<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>picture before me. You would prove to me that it is impossible for us ever to think of<lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>ourselves as artists. You take away our finest dream and you give us nothing in its place. " <lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>44 No, no, that's not for me to give you. That's for you to find, Surely there must be<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>laws at the roots of the Art of the Theatre, just as there are Laws at the roots of all true<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>Arts, which if found and mastered, would bring you all you desire? " 44 Yes, the search<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>would bring the actors to a wall. " 44 Leap it, then I " &amp; 44 Too high i " &amp; 44 Scale it,<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>then! " 44 How do we know where it would lead? " 44 Why, up and over. " 44 Yes,<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>but that's talking wildly, talking in the air. " 44 Well, that's the direction you fellows<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>have to go; ....fly in the air, live in the air. Something will follow when some of you begin<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>to. * I suppose, " continued he, 44 you will get at the root of the matter in time, and then<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>what a splendid future opens before you I In fact I envy you, 1 am not sure Ido not wish<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>that photography had been discovered before painting, so that we of this generation might<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>have had the intense joy of advancing, showing that photography was pretty well in its way,<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>but there was something better I " &amp; 44 Do you hold that our work is on a level with<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>photography? "&amp; 44 No, indeed, it is not half as exact. It is less of an art even than<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>photography. 1st fact you and I who have been talking all this time while the musician has<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>sat silent, sinking deeper and deeper into his chair, our arts by the side of his art, are jokes,<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>games, absurdities. " At which the musician must go and spoil the whole thing by getting<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>up and given vent to some foolish remark. The actor immediately cries out, 44 But 1<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>don't see that that's such a wonderful remark for a representative of the only art in the<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>world to make " at which they all laughed, the musician in a sort of crest-fallen, conscious<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>manner. 44 My dear fellow, that is just because he is a musician. He is nothing except<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>in his music. He is, in fact, somewhat unintelligent, except when he speaks in notes, in<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>tones, and in the rest of it, He hardly knows our language, he hardly knows our world,<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>and the greater the musician, the more is this noticeable; indeed it is rather a bad sign<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>when you nteet a composer who is intelligent. And as for the intellectual musician, why<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>that means another....; but we mustn't whisper that name here.... he is so popular to-day.<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>What an actor this man would have been, and what a personality he has. 1 understand<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>that all his life he had yearnings towards being an actor, and I believe he would have been<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>an excellent comedian, whereas he became a musician.... or was it a playwright? Anyhow,<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>it all turned out a great success.... a success of personality. " 44 Was it not a success of<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>art?" asks the musician. 44 Well, which art do you mean?" &amp; 44 Oh, all the arts<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>combined, " he replies, blunderingly but placidly. 44 How can that be? How can all arts<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>combine and make one art? It can only make one joke.... one theatre. Things which<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>slowly, by a natural law join together, may have some right in the course of many years<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>or many centuries to ask nature to bestow a new name on their product. Only by this means<lb facs="P14_TL00051"/>can a new art be born. 1 do not believe that the old mother approves of the forcing process;<lb facs="P14_TL00052"/>and if she ever winks at it, she soon has her revenge; and so is it with the arts. You cannot<lb facs="P14_TL00053"/>co-mingle them and cry out that you have created a new art. If you can find in nature<lb facs="P14_TL00054"/>a new materialy one which has never yet been used by man to give form to his thoughts,<lb facs="P14_TL00055"/>then you can say that yon are on the high road towards creating a new art. For you<lb facs="P14_TL00056"/>have found that by which you can create it. It then only remains for you to begin. The<lb facs="P14_TL00057"/>theatre, as I see it. has yet to find that material. " As so their conversation ended. <lb facs="P14_TL00058"/>For my part I am with the artist's last statement. My pleasure shall not be to compete<lb facs="P14_TL00059"/>with the strenuous photographer and I shall ever aim to get something entirely opposed<lb facs="P14_TL00060"/>to life as we see it. This flesh and blood life, lovely as it is to us all is for me not a<lb facs="P14_TL00061"/>thing made to search into, or to give out again to the world, even conventionalized. &amp;</ab>

Shades.... spirits seem to me to be more beautiful, and filled with<lb facs="P17_TL00006"/>more vitality than men and women; cities of men and women packed with pettiness,<lb facs="P17_TL00007"/>creatures in-human, secret.... coldest cold.... hardest humanity, JS/ For looking too long<lb facs="P17_TL00008"/>upon life, may one not find all this to be not the beautiful, nor the mysterious nor the<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>tragic, but the dull, the melodramatic, and the silly; the conspiracy against vitality....<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>against both red heat and white heat; and from such things which lack the sun<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>of life it is not possible to draw inspiration. But from that mysterious, joyous, and superbly<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>complete life which is called Death.... that life of shadow and of unknown shapes, where<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>all can not be blackness and fog as is supposed, but vivid colour, vivid light, sharp cut form,<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>and which one finds peopled with strange, fierce and solemn figures, pretty figures and<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>calm figures, and those figures impelled to some wonderous harmony of movement, all this<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>is something more than a mere matter of fact; from this idea of death which seems a kind<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>of spring, a blossoming—from this land and from this idea can come so vast an inspiration,<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>that with unhesitating exultation I leap forward to it and behold, in an instant, I find my<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>arms full of flowers.... 1 advance but a pace or two and again plenty is around me.... 1<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>pass at ease on a sea of beauty 1 sail whither the winds take me—there, there is no<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>danger. So much for my own personal wish;... but the entire theatre of the world is not<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>represented in me, nor in a hundred artists or actors, but in something far different.<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>Therefore what my personal aim may be is of very little importance. Yet the aim of the theatre<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>as a whole is to restore its art and it should commence by banishing from the theatre this<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>idea of impersonation, this idea of reproducing nature; for while impersonation is in the<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>Theatre, the Theatre can never become performers should train under the influence<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>of an earlier teaching (if the very earliest and finest principles are too stern to commence<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>with) and they will have to avoid that frantic desire to put "life" into their work; for<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>three thousand times against one time, it means the bringing of excessive gesture, swift<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>mimicry, speech which bellows and scene which dazzles, on to the stage, in the wild and<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>vain belief that by such means vitality can be conjured there. And in a few instances, to<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>prove the rule, all this partially succeeds. It succeeds partially with the bubbling personalities<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>of the stage, With them it is a case of sheer triumph in spite of the rules, in the very<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>teeth of the rules, and we who look on, throw our hats into the air,... cheer, and cheer<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>again. We have to; we don't want to consider or to question;—we go with the tide<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>through admiration and suggestion.... That we are hypnotised, our taste cares not a rap....<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>We are delighted to be so moved, and we literally jump for joy. The great personality has<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>triumphed both over us and the art. But personalities such as these are extremely rare, and<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>if we wish to see a personality assert itself in the theatre and entirely triumph as an actor<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>we must at the same time be quite indifferent about the play, the other actors, and Beauty.<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>&amp; Those who do not think with me in this whole matter are the worshippers, or respectful<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>admirers, of the personalities of the stage. It is intolerable to them that I should assert<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>that the stage must be cleared of all its actors and actresses before it will again revive.<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>How could they agree with me? That would include the removal of their favourites.... the<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>two or three beings who transform the stage for them from a vulgar joke into an ideal<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>land. But what should they fear? No danger threatens their favourites—for were it possible<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>to put an act into force to prohibit all men and women from appearing before the public<lb facs="P17_TL00048"/>upon the stage of a theatre, this would not in the least affect these favourites—these men<lb facs="P17_TL00049"/>and women of personality whom the playgoers crown. Consider any one of these personalities<lb facs="P17_TL00050"/>born at a period when the s£age was unknown; would it in any way have lessened their<lb facs="P17_TL00051"/>power.... hindered their expression ? Not a whit. Personality invents the means and ways<lb facs="P17_TL00052"/>by which it shall express itself; and acting is but one, (the very least) of the means at the<lb facs="P17_TL00053"/>commands of a great personality; and these men and women would have been famous at<lb facs="P17_TL00054"/>any time, and in any calling. But if there are many to whom it is intolerable that I<lb facs="P17_TL00055"/>should propose to clear the stage of ALL the actors and actresses in order to revive the<lb facs="P17_TL00056"/>Art of the Theatre, there are others to whom it seems agreeable. <lb facs="P17_TL00057"/>" The artist, " says Flaubert, " should be in his work like God in creation, invisible and<lb facs="P17_TL00058"/>" all-powerful; he should be felt everywhere and seen nowhere.

We want to take him into shelter, that is all the feeling the acting of Lear<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>" ever produced in me. The contemptible machinery by which they mimic the storm which<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>" he goes out in, is not more inadequate to represent the horror of the real elements than<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>" any actor can be to represent Lear. They might more easily propose to personate the<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>" Satan of Milton upon a stage, or one of Michaelangelo's terrible figures.... Lear is essentially<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>" impossible to be represented on the stage. " &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>" Hamlet himself seems hardly capable of being acted, " says William Hazlitt.<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>Dante in " La Vita Nuova " tells us that in dream Love in the figure of a youth appeared<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>to him. &amp; Discoursing of Beatrice, Dante is told by Love " to compose certain things in<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>" rhyme, in the which thou shalt set forth how strong a mastership I have obtained over thee,<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>" through her.... And so write these things that they shall seem rather to be spoken by a<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>" third person, and not directly by thee to her, which is scarce fitting. And again " There<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>" came upon me a great desire to say somewhat in rhyme: but when I began thinking how 1<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>" should say it, methought that to speak of her were unseemly, unless I spoke to other ladies<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>"in the second person. " We see then that to these men it is wrong that the living person<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>should advance into the frame and display himself upon his own canvas. They hold it as<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>" unseemly".... " scarce fitting. "<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>We have here witnesses against the whole business of the modern stage. &amp; Collectively they<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>pass the following sentence:... That it is bad art, or no art, to make so personal, so emotional<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>an appeal that the beholder forgets the thing itself while swamped by the personality, the<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>emotion, of its maker. J&amp; And now for the testimony of an actress. &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>Eleonora Duse has said: (i) " To save the theatre, the theatre must be destroyed, the actors<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>and actresses must all die of the plague. They poison the air, they make art impossible."<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>We may believe her. She means what Flaubert and Dante mean, even if she words it<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>differently. And there are many more witnesses to testify for me, if this is held to<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>be insufficient evidence. There are the people who never go to theatres, the millions of men<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>against the thousands who do go. Then, we have the support of most of the managers of<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>the theatre of to=&gt;day. The modern theatre manager thinks the stage should have its plays<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>gorgeously decorated. He will say that no pains should be spared to bring every assistance<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>towards cheating the audience into a sense of reality; he will never cease telling us how<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>important all these decorations are; he urges all this for several reasons and the following<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>reason is not the least.... He scents a grave danger in simple and good work; he sees that<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>there is a body of people who are opposed to these lavish decorations; he knows that there<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>has been a distinct movement, in Europe, against this display, it having been claimed that<lb facs="P18_TL00046"/>the great plays gained when represented in front of the plainest background. This movement<lb facs="P18_TL00047"/>can be proved to be a powerful one—it has spread from Krakau to Moscow, from Paris to<lb facs="P18_TL00048"/>Rome, from London to Berlin and Vienna. The managers see this danger ahead of them;<lb facs="P18_TL00049"/>they see that if once people came to realise this fact, if once the audience tasted of the<lb facs="P18_TL00050"/>delight which a sceneless play brings, they would then go further and desire the play which<lb facs="P18_TL00051"/>was presented without actors; and finally they would go on and on and on until they, and<lb facs="P18_TL00052"/>not the managers, had positively reformed the Art. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00053"/>Napoleon is reported to have said. "In life there is much that is unworthy which in art<lb facs="P18_TL00054"/>should be omitted; much of doubt and vacillation; and all should disappear in the<lb facs="P18_TL00055"/>representation of the hero. We should see him as a statue in which the weakness<lb facs="P18_TL00056"/>and tremors of the flesh are no longer perceptible.

It is a reasonable<lb facs="P19_TL00008"/>conclusion. Do away with the real tree, do away with the reality of delivery, do away<lb facs="P19_TL00009"/>with the reality of action, and you tend towards the doing away with the actor.<lb facs="P19_TL00010"/>This is what must come to pass in time, and 1 like to see the managers supporting the idea<lb facs="P19_TL00011"/>already. Do away with the actor, and you do away with the means by which a debased<lb facs="P19_TL00012"/>stage»realism is produced and flourishes. No longer would there be a living figure to<lb facs="P19_TL00013"/>confuse us into connecting actuality and art; no longer a living figure in which the weakness<lb facs="P19_TL00014"/>and tremors of the flesh were perceptible. &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00015"/>The actor must go, and in his place comes the inanimate figure—the uber-marionette we may<lb facs="P19_TL00016"/>cal him, until he has won for himself a better name. £&gt; Much has been written about the puppet<lb facs="P19_TL00017"/>—or marionette. There are some excellent volumes upon him, and he has also inspired several<lb facs="P19_TL00018"/>works of Art. To-day in his least happy period many people have come to regard him as rather<lb facs="P19_TL00019"/>a superior doll—and to think he has developed from the doll. This is incorrect. He is a<lb facs="P19_TL00020"/>descendant of the stone images of the old Temples—he is to-day a rather degenerate form of<lb facs="P19_TL00021"/>a God. Always the close friend of children he still knows how to select and attract his devotees.<lb facs="P19_TL00022"/>When anyone designs a puppet on paper, he draws a stiff and comic looking thing. Such<lb facs="P19_TL00023"/>a one has not even perceived what is contained in the idea which we now call the Marionette.<lb facs="P19_TL00024"/>He mistakes gravity of face and calmness of body for blank stupidity and angular deformity.<lb facs="P19_TL00025"/>Yet even Modern Puppets are extraordinary things. The applause may thunder or dribble,<lb facs="P19_TL00026"/>their hearts beat no faster, no slower, their signals do not grow hurried or confused;<lb facs="P19_TL00027"/>and, though drenched in a torrent of bouquets and love, the face of the leading lady remains<lb facs="P19_TL00028"/>as solemn, as beautiful and as remote as ever. &amp; There is something more than a flash of<lb facs="P19_TL00029"/>genius in the Marionette, and there is something in him more than the flashiness of<lb facs="P19_TL00030"/>displayed personality. The Marionette.... appears to me to be the last echo of some noble<lb facs="P19_TL00031"/>and beautiful art of a past civilization. But as with all art which has passed into fat or<lb facs="P19_TL00032"/>vulgar hands, the Puppet has become a reproach. AH puppets are now but low comedians.<lb facs="P19_TL00033"/>They imitate the comedians of the larger and fuller blooded stage. They enter only to fall<lb facs="P19_TL00034"/>on their back. They drink only to reel, and make love only to raise a laugh. They have<lb facs="P19_TL00035"/>forgotten the counsel of their Mother, the Sphinx. Their bodies have lost their grave grace,<lb facs="P19_TL00036"/>they have become stiff. Their eyes have lost that infinite subtlety of seeming to see; now<lb facs="P19_TL00037"/>they only stare. They display and jingle their wires and are cock-sure in their wooden<lb facs="P19_TL00038"/>wisdom. They have failed to remember that their art should carry on it the same stamp of<lb facs="P19_TL00039"/>reserve that we see at times on the work of other artists, and that the highest art is that<lb facs="P19_TL00040"/>which conceals the craft and forgets the craftsman. Am 1 mistaken, or is it not the old<lb facs="P19_TL00041"/>Greek Traveller of 8oo B. C. who, describing a visit to the TempIe»Theatre in Thebes, tells<lb facs="P19_TL00042"/>us that he was won to their beauty by their 44 noble artificiality." 44 Coming into the<lb facs="P19_TL00043"/>44 House of Visions I saw afar off the fair brown Queen seated upon her throne.... her<lb facs="P19_TL00044"/>44 tomb.... for both it seemed to me. 1 sank back upon my couch and watched her<lb facs="P19_TL00045"/>44 symbolic movements. With so much ease did her rhythms alter as with her movements<lb facs="P19_TL00046"/>44 they passed from limb to limb; with such a show of calm did she unloose for us the<lb facs="P19_TL00047"/>44 thoughts of her breast; so gravely and so beautifully did she linger on the statement of<lb facs="P19_TL00048"/>44 her sorrow, that with us it seemed as if no sorrow could harm her; no distortion of body<lb facs="P19_TL00049"/>44 or feature allowed us to dream that she was conquered; the passion and the pain were<lb facs="P19_TL00050"/>44 continually being caught by her hands, held gently, and viewed calmly. &amp; Her arms and<lb facs="P19_TL00051"/>44 hands seemed at one moment like a thin warm fountain of water which rose, then<lb facs="P19_TL00052"/>44 broke and fell with all those sweet pale fingers like spray into her lap. It would have<lb facs="P19_TL00053"/>44 been as a revelation of art to us had 1 not already seen that the same spirit dwelt in<lb facs="P19_TL00054"/>44 the other examples of the art of these Egyptians.

This in 800 B. C. And who knows whether the Puppet shall not once<lb facs="P20_TL00009"/>again become the faithful medium for the beautiful thoughts of the artist. May we not<lb facs="P20_TL00010"/>look forward with hope to that day which shall bring back to us once more the figure, or<lb facs="P20_TL00011"/>symbolic creature, made also by the cunning of the artist, so that we can regain once<lb facs="P20_TL00012"/>more the " nohle artificiality 99 which the old writer speaks of. £/ Then shall we no longer<lb facs="P20_TL00013"/>be under the cruel influence of the emotional confessions of weakness which are nightly<lb facs="P20_TL00014"/>witnessed by the people and which in their turn create in the beholders the very weaknesses<lb facs="P20_TL00015"/>which are exhibited. &amp; To that end we must study to remake these images—no longer<lb facs="P20_TL00016"/>content with a puppet, we must create an ttber-marionette. The iiber-marionette will<lb facs="P20_TL00017"/>not compete with Life—but will rather go beyond it. Its ideal will not be the flesh and<lb facs="P20_TL00018"/>blood but rather the body in Trance—it will aim to clothe itself with a deathlike Beauty<lb facs="P20_TL00019"/>while exhaling a living spirit. Several times in the course of this essay has a word or<lb facs="P20_TL00020"/>two about Death found its way on to the paper.... called there by the incessant clamouring<lb facs="P20_TL00021"/>of "Life! Life! Life!" which the Realists keep up. And this might be easily mistaken for<lb facs="P20_TL00022"/>an affectation especially by those who have no sympathy or delight in the power and the<lb facs="P20_TL00023"/>mysterious joyousness which is in all passionless works of art. If the famous Rubens and<lb facs="P20_TL00024"/>the celebrated Raphael made none but passionate and exuberant statements, there were<lb facs="P20_TL00025"/>many artists before them and since to whom moderation in their art was the most<lb facs="P20_TL00026"/>precious of all their aims, and these more than all others exhibit the true masculine<lb facs="P20_TL00027"/>manner. The other flamboyant or drooping artists whose works and names catch the eye<lb facs="P20_TL00028"/>of to-day do not so much speak like men as bawl like animals, or lisp like women. <lb facs="P20_TL00029"/>The wise, the moderate masters, strong because of the laws to which they swore to remain<lb facs="P20_TL00030"/>ever faithful.... their names unknown for the most part.... a fine family.... the creators of the<lb facs="P20_TL00031"/>great and tiny gods of the East and the West, the guardians of those larger times,... these all<lb facs="P20_TL00032"/>bent their thoughts forward towards the unknown, searching for sights and sounds in that<lb facs="P20_TL00033"/>peaceful and joyous country, that they might raise a figure of stone or sing a verse, investing<lb facs="P20_TL00034"/>it with that same peace and joy seen from afar, so as to balance all the grief and turmoil here.<lb facs="P20_TL00035"/>In America we can picture these brothers of that family of masters, living in their superb<lb facs="P20_TL00036"/>ancient cities, colossal cities which I ever think of as able to be moved in a single day; cities<lb facs="P20_TL00037"/>of spacious tents of silk and canopies of gold under which dwelt their gods; dwellings which<lb facs="P20_TL00038"/>contained all the requirements of the most fastidious; those moving cities which, as they<lb facs="P20_TL00039"/>travelled from height to plain, over rivers and down valleys, seemed like some vast<lb facs="P20_TL00040"/>advancing army of peace. And in each city not one or two men called " artists " whom the<lb facs="P20_TL00041"/>rest of the city looked upon as ne' er do well idlers, but many men chosen by the community<lb facs="P20_TL00042"/>because of their higher powers of perception.... artists; for that is what the title of artist<lb facs="P20_TL00043"/>means, one who perceives more than his fellows, and who records more than he has seen.<lb facs="P20_TL00044"/>And not the least among those artists was the artist of the ceremonies, the creator of the<lb facs="P20_TL00045"/>visions, the minister whose duty it was to celebrate their guiding spirit.... the spirit of Motion.<lb facs="P20_TL00046"/>In Asia, too, the forgotten masters of the temples and all that those temples contained, have<lb facs="P20_TL00047"/>permeated every thought, every mark in their work with this sense of calm motion resembling<lb facs="P20_TL00048"/>death.... glorifying and greeting it. In Africa, (which some of us think we are but now to<lb facs="P20_TL00049"/>civilize) this spirit dwelt,... the essence of the perfect civilization. There too dwelt the great<lb facs="P20_TL00050"/>masters, not individuals obsessed with the idea off each asserting his personality as if it was a<lb facs="P20_TL00051"/>valuable and mighty thing, but content because of a kind of holy patience to move their brains<lb facs="P20_TL00052"/>and their fingers only in that direction permitted by the law--in the service of the simple truths.<lb facs="P20_TL00053"/>How stern the law was, and how little the artist of that day permitted himself to make an<lb facs="P20_TL00054"/>exhibition of his personal feelings can be discovered by looking at any example of Egyptian art.<lb facs="P20_TL00055"/>Look at any limb ever carved by the Egyptians, search into all those carved eyes, they will<lb facs="P20_TL00056"/>deny you until the crack of doom.

They think<lb facs="P21_TL00041"/>at once of the wires; they think of the stiff hands and the jerky movements; they tell me<lb facs="P21_TL00042"/>it is " a funny little doll. " But let me tell them a few things about these Puppets. Let<lb facs="P21_TL00043"/>me again repeat that they are the descendants of a great and noble family of Images, Images<lb facs="P21_TL00044"/>which were made in the likeness of God; and that many centuries ago these figures had a<lb facs="P21_TL00045"/>rhythmical movement and not a jerky one; had no need for wires to support them, nor did<lb facs="P21_TL00046"/>they speak through the nose of the hidden manipulator. &amp; (Poor Punch, I mean no slight<lb facs="P21_TL00047"/>to you! You stand alone, dignified in your despair, as you look back across the centuries<lb facs="P21_TL00048"/>with painted tears still wet upon your ancient cheeks, and you seem to cry out appealingly<lb facs="P21_TL00049"/>to your dog, " Sister Anne, sister Anne, is nobody coming? " And then with that superb<lb facs="P21_TL00050"/>bravado of yours, you turn the force of our laughter (and my tears) upon yourself with the<lb facs="P21_TL00051"/>heartrending shriek of "Oh my nose! Oh, my nose! Oh my nose!) Did you think, ladies<lb facs="P21_TL00052"/>and gentlemen, that thees puppets were always little things of but a foot high?<lb facs="P21_TL00053"/>&amp; Indeed, no! The Puppet had once a more generous form than yourselves. &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00054"/>Do you think that he kicked his feet about on a little platform six foot square, made to<lb facs="P21_TL00055"/>resemble a little old fashioned theatre; so that his head almost touched the top of the<lb facs="P21_TL00056"/>proscenium; and do you think that he always lived in a little house where the door and</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P22_TL00002"/>windows were as small as a doll's house, with painted window blinds parted in the centre,<lb facs="P22_TL00003"/>and where the flowers of his little garden had courageous petals as big as his head? Try<lb facs="P22_TL00004"/>and dispel this idea altogether from your minds, and let me tell you something of his habitation.<lb facs="P22_TL00005"/>In Asia lay his first Kingdom. On the banks of the Ganges they built him his home,... a<lb facs="P22_TL00006"/>vast palace springing from column to column into the air and pouring from column to column<lb facs="P22_TL00007"/>down again into the water. Surrounded by gardens spread warm and rich with flowers and<lb facs="P22_TL00008"/>cooled by fountains; gardens into which no sounds entered, in which hardly anything stirred.<lb facs="P22_TL00009"/>Only in the cool and private chambers of this palace the swift minds of his attendants<lb facs="P22_TL00010"/>stirred incessantly. Something they were making which should become him, something<lb facs="P22_TL00011"/>to honour the spirit which had given him birth. And then, one day, the ceremony. &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00012"/>In this ceremony he took part; a celebration once more in praise of the Creation; the old<lb facs="P22_TL00013"/>thanksgiving, the hurrah for existence, and with it the sterner hurrah for the privilege of<lb facs="P22_TL00014"/>the existence to come, which is veiled by the word Death. And during this ceremony there<lb facs="P22_TL00015"/>appeared before the eyes of the brown worshippers the symbols of all things on earth and in<lb facs="P22_TL00016"/>Nirvana. The symbol of the beautiful tree, the symbol of the hills, the symbols of those rich<lb facs="P22_TL00017"/>ores which the hills contained; the symbol of the cloud, of the wind, and of all swift moving<lb facs="P22_TL00018"/>things; the symbol of the quickest of moving things, of Thought, of Remembrance; the<lb facs="P22_TL00019"/>symbol of the Animal, the symbol of Buddha and of Man.... and here he comes, the figure,<lb facs="P22_TL00020"/>the Puppet at whom you all laugh so much. You laugh at him to«day because none but<lb facs="P22_TL00021"/>his weaknesses are left to him. He reflects these from you; but you would not have laughed<lb facs="P22_TL00022"/>had you seen him in his prime, in that age when he was called upon to be the symbol of<lb facs="P22_TL00023"/>man in the great ceremony, and, stepping forward, was the beautiful figure of our<lb facs="P22_TL00024"/>heart's delight. &amp; If we should laugh at and insult the memory of the Puppet, we should<lb facs="P22_TL00025"/>be laughing at the fall that we have brought about in ourselves.... laughing at the Beliefs<lb facs="P22_TL00026"/>and Images we have broken. A few centuries later, and we find his home a little the<lb facs="P22_TL00027"/>worse for wear. &amp; Prom a temple it has become, I will not say a theatre, but something<lb facs="P22_TL00028"/>between a temple and a theatre, and he is losing his health in it. Something is in the air;<lb facs="P22_TL00029"/>his doctors tell him he must be careful. " And what am 1 to fear the most? " he asks<lb facs="P22_TL00030"/>them. They answer him; " Fear most the vanity of men. " He thinks, " But that is<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>what 1 myself have always taught; that we who celebrated in joy this our existence, should<lb facs="P22_TL00032"/>have this one great fear. Is it possible that I, one who has ever revealed this truth, should<lb facs="P22_TL00033"/>be one to lose sight of it and should myself be one of the first to fall? Clearly some subtle<lb facs="P22_TL00034"/>attack is to be made on me. 1 will keep my eyes upon the Heavens. " And he dismisses<lb facs="P22_TL00035"/>his doctors and ponders upon it.<lb facs="P22_TL00036"/>And now let me tell you who It was that came to disturb the calm air which surrounded<lb facs="P22_TL00037"/>this curiously perfect thing. It is on record that somewhat later he took up his abode on<lb facs="P22_TL00038"/>the far Eastern Coast, and there came two women to look upon him. And at the ceremony<lb facs="P22_TL00039"/>to which they came he glowed with such earthly splendour and yet such unearthly simplicity,<lb facs="P22_TL00040"/>that though he proved an inspiration to the thousand nine hundred and ninety eight souls<lb facs="P22_TL00041"/>who participated in the festival, an inspiration which cleared the mind even as it intoxicated,<lb facs="P22_TL00042"/>yet to these two women it proved an intoxication only. He did not see them, his eyes were<lb facs="P22_TL00043"/>fixed on the heavens: but he charged them full of a desire too great to be quenched; the<lb facs="P22_TL00044"/>desire to stand as the direct symbol of the Divinity in Man. No sooner thought than<lb facs="P22_TL00045"/>done; and arraying themselves as best they could in garments (" like his, " they thought)<lb facs="P22_TL00046"/>moving with gestures (" like his " they said) and being able to cause wonderment in the minds<lb facs="P22_TL00047"/>of the beholders (" even as he does, " they cried) they built themselves a temple (" like his 99<lb facs="P22_TL00048"/>" like his "), and supplied the demand of the vulgar,... the whole thing a poor parody.<lb facs="P22_TL00049"/>This is on record. It is the first record in the East of the actor.... The actor springs from<lb facs="P22_TL00050"/>the foolish vanity of two women who are not strong enough to look upon the symbol of<lb facs="P22_TL00051"/>godhead without desiring to tamper with it; and the parody proved profitable. In fifty or<lb facs="P22_TL00052"/>a hundred years, places for such parodies were to be found in all parts of the land. <lb facs="P22_TL00053"/>Weeds, they say, grow quickly, and that wilderness of weeds, the modern theatre, soon<lb facs="P22_TL00054"/>sprang up. The figure of the Divine Puppet, attracted fewer and fewer lovers, and the women<lb facs="P22_TL00055"/>were quite the latest thing. With the fading of the Puppet and the advance of these<lb facs="P22_TL00056"/>women who exhibited themselves on the stage in his place, came that darker spirit<lb facs="P22_TL00057"/>which is called Chaos, and in its wake the triumph of the riotous Personality. Do you<lb facs="P22_TL00058"/>see then, what has made me love and learn to value that which to-day we call the puppet</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P25_TL00004"/>the page facing we give a clue to good scene painting. If the young and serious designer<lb facs="P25_TL00005"/>for the stage should study from these little pictures alone, and could bring himself to see<lb facs="P25_TL00006"/>the wonder which lies in them and disregard all that he is taught by the modern theatre,<lb facs="P25_TL00007"/>he would soon learn to invent wonderful and charming backgrounds for the plays of<lb facs="P25_TL00008"/>Shakespeare. Merchant of Venice lived in just such a Venice as that shown<lb facs="P25_TL00009"/>here; Shakespeare's Julius Caesar in just such a Rome. The modern scene painter will say<lb facs="P25_TL00010"/>that this design for Venice is an ill-drawn and lifeless design, and that the modern painters<lb facs="P25_TL00011"/>can make better. But we have yet to see a better modern design, and we have looked in<lb facs="P25_TL00012"/>»<lb facs="P25_TL00013"/>vain for one in the Theatres of Europe. And why this is so much better, and so far better<lb facs="P25_TL00014"/>suited to the Theatre than the modern rubbish which gets there, is that this design is full<lb facs="P25_TL00015"/>of strength, distinction, and grace, and thoughtful feeling, and the modern designs are full of<lb facs="P25_TL00016"/>weakness, vulgarity, and conceit. How then can the spirit of Shakespeare's plays be rightly<lb facs="P25_TL00017"/>revealed, or understood, when it is suffocated by these scenic grossnesses? &amp;<lb facs="P25_TL00018"/>It is, not a question whether scenery is good or bad for the Shakespearean drama.... it is only<lb facs="P25_TL00019"/>whether good scenery is good or bad for these plays. Surely good scenery is entirely good.<lb facs="P25_TL00020"/>And what is good scenery? Is it necessarily a plain curtain, and a table, and two chairs? Why<lb facs="P25_TL00021"/>is this good? What makes it worthy to be called good scenery? We know that over-much<lb facs="P25_TL00022"/>scenery nearly always can be called bad scenery.... but over-little scenery is also as bad; it<lb facs="P25_TL00023"/>is a case of the Devil or the deep sea. Then is a medium amount of scenery good scenery?<lb facs="P25_TL00024"/>Well, the amount is of some importance, though a medium amount of good scenery and a<lb facs="P25_TL00025"/>medium amount of bad scenery leaves us no better off one way or the other. Nol It is not<lb facs="P25_TL00026"/>the amount of scenery, good or bad ; it is the quality. And will the modern designers quarrel<lb facs="P25_TL00027"/>with us about quality?.... well, quality is a divine thing and all men desire it. What these<lb facs="P25_TL00028"/>designs for Venice and Rome contain is quality,.... and as that is a thing which the stage<lb facs="P25_TL00029"/>never dreams of winning, what is the good of speaking about it? &amp; But keep your thoughts<lb facs="P25_TL00030"/>fixed on these and like designs; it can do you no harm, and may do you much good,..., and<lb facs="P25_TL00031"/>for the love of your Art, your country, or even yourself, wake up, and understand them.<lb facs="P25_TL00032"/>&amp; If I were to fill this number of " The Mask " with talk about line, design, atmosphere,<lb facs="P25_TL00033"/>style, and all the rest of it, I should only confuse you, for you cannot understand what you<lb facs="P25_TL00034"/>cannot feel. So I print these two designs and put them before you. Look at them long<lb facs="P25_TL00035"/>enough, and you will begin to feel the foolishness of modern sceneries. The moment you<lb facs="P25_TL00036"/>feel this, you will begin to understand the sense of these designs. And that will be counted</ab>

In some lists the name of Gorki, with his single play, "Nachtasyl,,<lb facs="P28_TL00041"/>appears seven times in a week. That of Strindberg five or six times, and the youngest poet<lb facs="P28_TL00042"/>of Germany, Hofmannsthal, not less than eight times in one week. Add to this the<lb facs="P28_TL00043"/>performance of all these first class works in Dresden, Munich, Hamburg, Leipzig, Mannheim,<lb facs="P28_TL00044"/>Heidelberg, Darmstadt, Dussledorf, Breslau, and some idea can be gathered as to the energy<lb facs="P28_TL00045"/>of the Theatre in Germany. It will also be seen that only eight of the above theatres<lb facs="P28_TL00046"/>attempt the continuous run system, and that the plays selected for this experiment are not<lb facs="P28_TL00047"/>those of Shakespeare, Schiller or Goethe. Compare this with the English system which runs<lb facs="P28_TL00048"/>all the good things to death, and it will be seen that the advantage lies with the Germans....<lb facs="P28_TL00049"/>not the German Theatres any more than the English Tlieatresy but with the German People<lb facs="P28_TL00050"/>for whom the theatre exists. That Mr Granville Barker's stand against this system should<lb facs="P28_TL00051"/>not have received national, or at least strong personal, support from capitalists keen on<lb facs="P28_TL00052"/>doing some good with their wealth, is not merely surprising but entirely and disastrously<lb facs="P28_TL00053"/>shameful. If Mr Barker's attitude had been very extreme, one could have understood this;<lb facs="P28_TL00054"/>or if his scheme had included a revival of the entire Art of the Theatre, or had been in any<lb facs="P28_TL00055"/>way a specially artistic movement, we could understand that the gravity of the offence<lb facs="P28_TL00056"/>demanded a stern treatment of cold water; but it was merely a sensible and very plucky<lb facs="P28_TL00057"/>attempt to raise the English Theatre to the level of the Continental Theatre. </ab>

It is an expressive criticism,<lb facs="P29_TL00074"/>and coming from the beautiful and celebrated<lb facs="P29_TL00075"/>Ellen Key, it is valuable.<lb facs="P29_TL00076"/>Another correspondent sends us the following<lb facs="P29_TL00077"/>from the same city:.... "A new theatre has<lb facs="P29_TL00078"/>been built. The directors think of conducting<lb facs="P29_TL00079"/>it as a commercial theatre, so that we are no<lb facs="P29_TL00080"/>further forward than we were before it was<lb facs="P29_TL00081"/>built. The inauguration was a dull affair<lb facs="P29_TL00082"/>For the construction of the Theatre itself<lb facs="P29_TL00083"/>we can find no words of praise. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P29_TL00084"/>Conventional to the last degree, and made<lb facs="P29_TL00085"/>after the old worn-out pattern of the last 150<lb facs="P29_TL00086"/>years, the architect seems to have entirely<lb facs="P29_TL00087"/>disregarded Wagner's lesson to Europe as to<lb facs="P29_TL00088"/>the purpose and therefore the shape, of an<lb facs="P29_TL00089"/>auditorium.The ground plan also shows that the<lb facs="P29_TL00090"/>architect was obliged to make shift with his<lb facs="P29_TL00091"/>space. It is very disappointing. The March<lb facs="P29_TL00092"/>number of " Ord och Bild contains an<lb facs="P29_TL00093"/>interesting illustrated description of this new<lb facs="P29_TL00094"/>Theatre. There are thirty five illustrations, and<lb facs="P29_TL00095"/>amongst these are some excellent designs by<lb facs="P29_TL00096"/>Carl Miller, and six by that charming artist, Carl<lb facs="P29_TL00097"/>Larson. Especially interesting is the " Skalden "<lb facs="P29_TL00098"/>on page 151. This design the artist was evidently<lb facs="P29_TL00099"/>persuaded or obliged to alter, for it differs<lb facs="P29_TL00100"/>greatly from the final design shown in another<lb facs="P29_TL00101"/>illustration; we prefer the sketch on page<lb facs="P29_TL00102"/>151. The other designs are interesting in<lb facs="P29_TL00103"/>themselves as showing the tendency of a<lb facs="P29_TL00104"/>group of Scandinavian artists. &amp; </ab>

                                       <lb facs="P29_TL00107"/>The Munich Exhibition of 1908 will contain<lb facs="P29_TL00108"/>a Model Theatre. It will be the work of the<lb facs="P29_TL00109"/>artists of the city, who have prepared models<lb facs="P29_TL00110"/>of their scenes. The artists have worked with<lb facs="P29_TL00111"/>love, and, in many cases, have produced in<lb facs="P29_TL00112"/>their scenes the impression of space. The<lb facs="P29_TL00113"/>actual value of some of the attempts,<lb facs="P29_TL00114"/>(particularly the " Faust " scenes by Erler)<lb facs="P29_TL00115"/>depend much upon the stage conditions and<lb facs="P29_TL00116"/>particularly upon the lighting, and therefore<lb facs="P29_TL00117"/>these models can only be as incomplete<lb facs="P29_TL00118"/>sketches. At the Press view held a little<lb facs="P29_TL00119"/>while ago, it was clear to me that the modern<lb facs="P29_TL00120"/>Theatre can supply the simple requirements<lb facs="P29_TL00121"/>of these artists much will have been gained<lb facs="P29_TL00122"/>for the art of stage production. The models<lb facs="P29_TL00123"/>were on view in the studio of Professor<lb facs="P29_TL00124"/>Littmann, whose work as architect for the<lb facs="P29_TL00125"/>Prince Regent Theatre and for the new<lb facs="P29_TL00126"/>Theatre in weimar is well known.

By means of<lb facs="P30_TL00010"/>this the stage opening can be diminished or<lb facs="P30_TL00011"/>enlarged at will. Lear's Council Chamber and<lb facs="P30_TL00012"/>the Hovel can both show to by this means,<lb facs="P30_TL00013"/>and it is obvious that this assists the<lb facs="P30_TL00014"/>ordinary spectator to feel the reality of the<lb facs="P30_TL00015"/>representation. Whether it is of any value<lb facs="P30_TL00016"/>to the art is quite another matter. It is<lb facs="P30_TL00017"/>note that a moveable proscenium<lb facs="P30_TL00018"/>was designed by Professor Herkomer many<lb facs="P30_TL00019"/>years ago. He was even courteous enough to<lb facs="P30_TL00020"/>exhibit a model of it to a gathering of English<lb facs="P30_TL00021"/>managers, stage«managers, actors, and<lb facs="P30_TL00022"/>actresses who filled the small Avenue Theatre,<lb facs="P30_TL00023"/>(now the " Playhouse ") to listen to the<lb facs="P30_TL00024"/>excellent address which he delivered upon the<lb facs="P30_TL00025"/>idea.

The<lb facs="P30_TL00030"/>lecture was delivered somewhere about the<lb facs="P30_TL00031"/>year 1898 &amp; the designs for this moveable<lb facs="P30_TL00032"/>proscenium may be seen in a large volume<lb facs="P30_TL00033"/>on " Stage Construction " published by</ab>

At 8 o'clock in the evenig<lb facs="P30_TL00119"/>the front of the building was still burning.<lb facs="P30_TL00120"/>Although the Theatre is a wreck, many of its<lb facs="P30_TL00121"/>valuable treasures were, fortunately,<lb facs="P30_TL00122"/>unharmed. These comprise the arms and<lb facs="P30_TL00123"/>armour, many of the properties, and also the<lb facs="P30_TL00124"/>priceless library. The Meiningen Court<lb facs="P30_TL00125"/>Theatre was built in 1830. Duke George II took<lb facs="P30_TL00126"/>a deep interest in the work, and under his<lb facs="P30_TL00127"/>protection the Meiningen stage flourished and<lb facs="P30_TL00128"/>spread a good influence through all the<lb facs="P30_TL00129"/>Theatres of Germany. One of the first<lb facs="P30_TL00130"/>directors,., (or intendant, as he is called), was<lb facs="P30_TL00131"/>the marshall of the court, Von Stein; but as<lb facs="P30_TL00132"/>the theatre grew in importance Von Stein<lb facs="P30_TL00133"/>recommended his sovereign to invite the poet<lb facs="P30_TL00134"/>Frederic Bodenstedt to fill the position.<lb facs="P30_TL00135"/>Bodenstedt remained only a short time in<lb facs="P30_TL00136"/>Meiningen and the Duke gradually took matters<lb facs="P30_TL00137"/>into his own hands. In the work he was greatly<lb facs="P30_TL00138"/>assisted by his wife, Baronness von Heldburg,</ab>
                                    <ab facs="P31_TB00002">
                                       <lb facs="P31_TL00002"/>a lady of English origin and sometime leading<lb facs="P31_TL00003"/>actress of the Meningen Theatre. The Duke<lb facs="P31_TL00004"/>also had an able assistant and organizer<lb facs="P31_TL00005"/>in Herr Ferdinand Chronegk, and under<lb facs="P31_TL00006"/>his leadership the Meiningen Company made<lb facs="P31_TL00007"/>their famous tours of Europe. Their work<lb facs="P31_TL00008"/>won for them the applause of London, Berlin<lb facs="P31_TL00009"/>and St Petersburg, where they became great<lb facs="P31_TL00010"/>favourites. In 1890 these tours ceased. It<lb facs="P31_TL00011"/>was the Meiningen Theatre which first started<lb facs="P31_TL00012"/>the 44 historically correct " school, and which<lb facs="P31_TL00013"/>advocated a lavish display of this 44 accurate<lb facs="P31_TL00014"/>detail. " But the crown of the Meningen<lb facs="P31_TL00015"/>Company was its Discipline....and the spirit of<lb facs="P31_TL00016"/>this discipline was unselfishness. When a new<lb facs="P31_TL00017"/>actor was engaged the Duke would say to<lb facs="P31_TL00018"/>him, 44 If you wish to become a Meiniger you<lb facs="P31_TL00019"/>must hold the Institute in such respect that<lb facs="P31_TL00020"/>you will sacrifice everything personal to<lb facs="P31_TL00021"/>contribute to the glory of the whole, and<lb facs="P31_TL00022"/>you will act as a stage supernumary. As an<lb facs="P31_TL00023"/>example of the discipline in little matters, a<lb facs="P31_TL00024"/>visitor to the theatre tells us that one day<lb facs="P31_TL00025"/>the chief hair-dresser had been fined two<lb facs="P31_TL00026"/>marks for giving to Marguerite de Valois in<lb facs="P31_TL00027"/>the 44 Bluthochziet," a coiffure which was not<lb facs="P31_TL00028"/>historically correct and was contrary to<lb facs="P31_TL00029"/>orders. It availed nothing to say that the<lb facs="P31_TL00030"/>actress herself desired the change. The hair<lb facs="P31_TL00031"/>dresser was responsible for his department<lb facs="P31_TL00032"/>and had to bear the fine. Yet so little are<lb facs="P31_TL00033"/>these rules felt to be a hardship, that<lb facs="P31_TL00034"/>throughout Germany it is a matter of<lb facs="P31_TL00035"/>ambition for an actor and an actress to become</ab>

So<lb facs="P31_TL00067"/>spake one of London's leading Actor Managers<lb facs="P31_TL00068"/>while witnessing a performance of the Sicilian<lb facs="P31_TL00069"/>players, at whose head stands the superb</ab>
                                    <ab facs="P31_TB00007">
                                       <lb facs="P31_TL00070"/>Grasso. The same Actor Manager added that<lb facs="P31_TL00071"/>if it has not been that the world might have<lb facs="P31_TL00072"/>thought him a prude he would have got up<lb facs="P31_TL00073"/>and left the theatre. Little could the Theatre<lb facs="P31_TL00074"/>have guessed that day the terrible crisis<lb facs="P31_TL00075"/>through which it was passing. How many of<lb facs="P31_TL00076"/>the audience were conscious of the possible<lb facs="P31_TL00077"/>Exodus of this Actor Manager? A moment's<lb facs="P31_TL00078"/>courage on the part of this gentleman, and<lb facs="P31_TL00079"/>the face of the whole theatrical world might<lb facs="P31_TL00080"/>have been altered. £?<lb facs="P31_TL00081"/>The Sicilian players had the intention of<lb facs="P31_TL00082"/>playing in London for two weeks. The<lb facs="P31_TL00083"/>overwhelming ovation accorded them by the<lb facs="P31_TL00084"/>people of London determined them to extend<lb facs="P31_TL00085"/>their visit for three weeks more. SIgnor Grasso<lb facs="P31_TL00086"/>and Signorina Mimi Aguglia have won all the<lb facs="P31_TL00087"/>hearts and turned all the heads. It has done<lb facs="P31_TL00088"/>London much good to see them, and their work<lb facs="P31_TL00089"/>has puzzled nobody but the critics. Everybody<lb facs="P31_TL00090"/>was enthusiastic. In the stalls and dress-circle<lb facs="P31_TL00091"/>sat the curious armed with the indelicate<lb facs="P31_TL00092"/>opera glass; in the pit and the gallery sat or<lb facs="P31_TL00093"/>stood the flower of England's aristocracy,...<lb facs="P31_TL00094"/>that is to say, her scientists, artists, musicians,<lb facs="P31_TL00095"/>poets, and her ladies. What a charming<lb facs="P31_TL00096"/>gathering it was to be sure; how witty and<lb facs="P31_TL00097"/>gracious their acceptance of the brave qualties<lb facs="P31_TL00098"/>of this man and woman,... how sensible the<lb facs="P31_TL00099"/>criticisms they uttered. To read the papers<lb facs="P31_TL00100"/>next morning after hearing them was tedious.<lb facs="P31_TL00101"/>The critics, (we do not include the talented<lb facs="P31_TL00102"/>writers) to a man seem to have gone out<lb facs="P31_TL00103"/>between the acts and asked one another,<lb facs="P31_TL00104"/>44 Well, what do you think of it? " and each<lb facs="P31_TL00105"/>seems to have replied, 44 don't know, what do<lb facs="P31_TL00106"/>you ? " ....and both may have agreed to ask<lb facs="P31_TL00107"/>some one in the pit. Then each seems to have<lb facs="P31_TL00108"/>been button-holed either by a dandified<lb facs="P31_TL00109"/>merchant or an armour plate manufacturer,<lb facs="P31_TL00110"/>and been told exactly what to think. &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00111"/>So as you see it is all very amusing still in<lb facs="P31_TL00112"/>the theatrical world here. The same play is<lb facs="P31_TL00113"/>enacted night after night in each theatre and<lb facs="P31_TL00114"/>the final criticism of it all is that the ladies<lb facs="P31_TL00115"/>of London are divinely fair and stand as the<lb facs="P31_TL00116"/>only excuse for that arrogant tomfoolery....</ab>

London Journal.<lb facs="P32_TL00013"/>A nd this is the best paragraph which can<lb facs="P32_TL00014"/>be made up out of an event of really some<lb facs="P32_TL00015"/>importance to the theatre as an Art Institution.<lb facs="P32_TL00016"/>Surely such vulgarity is a trifle tedious,<lb facs="P32_TL00017"/>especially whew it appears in a well-known<lb facs="P32_TL00018"/>London theatrical paper. If the Dramatic<lb facs="P32_TL00019"/>Journals do not control the tendency of<lb facs="P32_TL00020"/>writers to vulgarise the stage, then the case is<lb facs="P32_TL00021"/>getting rather serious. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P32_TL00022"/>The tragedy of " Electra " was first produced<lb facs="P32_TL00023"/>in Berlin by Director Reinhardt, in, we believe,<lb facs="P32_TL00024"/>the year 1903. It was one of a series of<lb facs="P32_TL00025"/>remarkable plays from the pen of Dr Hugo<lb facs="P32_TL00026"/>von Hofmannsthal, the youngest and most<lb facs="P32_TL00027"/>gifted of the German poets, whose work<lb facs="P32_TL00028"/>deserves a more ideal treatment on the stage<lb facs="P32_TL00029"/>than it ever receives. &amp;<lb facs="P32_TL00030"/>Hofmannsthal is no realist in the theatrical<lb facs="P32_TL00031"/>sense of the word. Realism in the Theatre<lb facs="P32_TL00032"/>of the North means Gloominess, a darkened<lb facs="P32_TL00033"/>stage and commonplace, (not even good<lb facs="P32_TL00034"/>honest) drawing room and stable gestures.<lb facs="P32_TL00035"/>" Electra " at the Kleines Theater in Berlin<lb facs="P32_TL00036"/>was a depressing not an inspiring sight. The<lb facs="P32_TL00037"/>Kleines Theater is a fine little theatre made<lb facs="P32_TL00038"/>for a certain kind of play,.... for " Nachazyl ",<lb facs="P32_TL00039"/>for " The Green Cockatoo ", but it is neither<lb facs="P32_TL00040"/>built nor decorated to hold the noble and tender<lb facs="P32_TL00041"/>thoughts of a Poet. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P32_TL00042"/>A gong precedes the drawing back of a gloomy<lb facs="P32_TL00043"/>curtain and reveals, no matter what the piece,<lb facs="P32_TL00044"/>a gloomy scene. The gloom recalled to us the<lb facs="P32_TL00045"/>earliest efforts of a certain English producer<lb facs="P32_TL00046"/>of plays, who managed, however, to give a<lb facs="P32_TL00047"/>sense of space to his scenes from the very first.<lb facs="P32_TL00048"/>But where gloom is allied with newness it<lb facs="P32_TL00049"/>weighs heavily upon the spirit. Hofmannsthal's<lb facs="P32_TL00050"/>play needed a finer, a grander treatment.<lb facs="P32_TL00051"/>Instead of a despairing gong we needed the<lb facs="P32_TL00052"/>piercing blare of silver trumpets. Instead of<lb facs="P32_TL00053"/>a cramped brown-black scene of imitation<lb facs="P32_TL00054"/>stonework set upon a raised platform close<lb facs="P32_TL00055"/>to our seats, we needed an imaginative scene,<lb facs="P32_TL00056"/>full of a sense of colour, placed upon a stage<lb facs="P32_TL00057"/>which should allow proportion its <lb facs="P32_TL00058"/>The acting in the play was made to appear<lb facs="P32_TL00059"/>amateurish on account of the disproportion<lb facs="P32_TL00060"/>between stage and play. Frau Eysolt, who is<lb facs="P32_TL00061"/>quite one of the most thoughtful actresses in<lb facs="P32_TL00062"/>Berlin, appeared to us to a great disadvantage<lb facs="P32_TL00063"/>owing to this confusion of proportion. £/<lb facs="P32_TL00064"/>Even under those unfortunate conditions the<lb facs="P32_TL00065"/>beauty of the play could not be hidden.

They will see nothing.<lb facs="P32_TL00089"/>Salome's dance is revoltingly stupid wherever<lb facs="P32_TL00090"/>it has been presented (we have not seen Miss<lb facs="P32_TL00091"/>Loie Fuller's invention of this dance) and the<lb facs="P32_TL00092"/>dance in " Electra ,, means a few leaps in the<lb facs="P32_TL00093"/>air at best, and the curtain descends.<lb facs="P32_TL00094"/>Then, too, the costume for " Electra "is a<lb facs="P32_TL00095"/>very serious and tragic dress, Salome's utterly<lb facs="P32_TL00096"/>flippant, aud fitted for opera bouffe. " Electra "<lb facs="P32_TL00097"/>should certainly be seen in England. &amp;<lb facs="P32_TL00098"/>Writing of " Salome " reminds us of a<lb facs="P32_TL00099"/>certain tendency in some of the theatres<lb facs="P32_TL00100"/>(especially in Germany) to attract a weary<lb facs="P32_TL00101"/>public to the playhouse by the exhibition of<lb facs="P32_TL00102"/>a rather exaggerated nudity. In certain<lb facs="P32_TL00103"/>German cities the actress who has taken the<lb facs="P32_TL00104"/>part of " Salome " has been obliged to appear<lb facs="P32_TL00105"/>in this half-witted condition. It does not add<lb facs="P32_TL00106"/>to the beauty of the play,... it rather spoils<lb facs="P32_TL00107"/>the little beauty which is there. The precedent<lb facs="P32_TL00108"/>is a bad one, and, allied to plays of a realistic<lb facs="P32_TL00109"/>nature, a grotesque disharmony is produced.<lb facs="P32_TL00110"/>A fine and ancient tradition secured for us by<lb facs="P32_TL00111"/>the old masters of art now permits the<lb facs="P32_TL00112"/>exhibition of nude works of art in sculpture<lb facs="P32_TL00113"/>and painting. A healthy tradition almost<lb facs="P32_TL00114"/>permits nudity at the seaside. And 1 believe<lb facs="P32_TL00115"/>if the exponents of " Salome " would face the<lb facs="P32_TL00116"/>comparison with nature and would perform<lb facs="P32_TL00117"/>for us in the sun upon the hills and the sands,<lb facs="P32_TL00118"/>we should all be as happy as sand-boys.<lb facs="P32_TL00119"/>Artificiality would not dare to face the daylight<lb facs="P32_TL00120"/>and air.

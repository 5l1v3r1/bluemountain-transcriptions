When I<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>become a reformer, that is to say, a surgeon and a physician<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>in one, I shall take Hamlet's advice and " reform it altogether",<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>beginning with myself and ending with the lime-light man.<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>&amp; But to be a reformer one must be in the position of a<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>reformer; that is to say, one must have at least half a dozen<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>or a dozen theatres in different parts of the world so that<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>the reforms spread evenly. Two small progressive theatres<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>in Paris, London or Berlin are quite useless towards improving<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>the state of things in the theatre.... its state as an art and<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>an institution.

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>little what is passing in the two French theatres. Those who live in Paris and London have<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>seldom heard of the Berlin theatres. And those who live in Berlin and Paris hardly know that<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>any such theatres exist in England. &amp; And so it is that these gallant little theatres which<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>make daily efforts to improve the state of things, bring about no marked nor lasting<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>improvement, because all their energy and occasional good deeds evaporate after a few<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>thousand people have left the theatre. And the Art of the Theatre still remains unknown.<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>It would be quite another matter, (and 1 should be unable to write as 1 do), if any of<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>these theatres had discovered kaws for the art of the theatre; for these theatres to be<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>unknown, unheard of, would matter but little to the men who are busy all the time<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>searching for the truths which are the basis of all things. One of the evil tendencies<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>of the modern theatre is to forget this entirely.... to aim at being heard of for a few days<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>and months, to make an effect in front of a full audience for two or three hundred<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>evenings, and there an end. To reform this.... would it not need the headlong strength<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>of some profoundly stupid giant? &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>1 write, then, as an 0n100ker,.... not as a casual onlooker nor as an irritable one, but<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>more as one who takes a loving interest in watching the growth of plants in a beautiful<lb facs="P7_TL00046"/>garden. The eye of such a man is instantly arrested by the weeds. Nothing seems so<lb facs="P7_TL00047"/>foolish or so abominable to him as the weeds which absorb the goodness from the soil,<lb facs="P7_TL00048"/>robbing the other plants of that goodness and altogether spoiling the beauty of the garden;<lb facs="P7_TL00049"/>and it is the weeds, the evil tendencies of the modern theatre, that I am concerned with here.<lb facs="P7_TL00050"/>&amp; Bear in mind that when 1 speak of the theatre 1 do not allude especially to what is<lb facs="P7_TL00051"/>called the English theatre; nor do I mean that which they call the French theatre; 1 do</ab>

To encourage piracy and imitation<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>instead of cultivating natural resource.... To take the keys of the place from their rightful<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>keepers, the artists, and to hand them over to the " Business man " or anyone. &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>&amp; I write, as I say, as an onlooker, but I have been for over fifteen years a worker in<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>the theatre. This 1 say for the benefit of those who may not know and who question my<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>authority for these statements. <lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>I have many times written that there is only one way to obtain unity in the art of the<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>theatre. I suppose it is unnecessary to explain why unity should be there as in other<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>great arts; I suppose it offends no one to admit that unless unity reigns " chaos is come<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>again; I suppose this is quite clear; » ? - I &amp; Very well then - So far, so good. And it<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>should not be difficult to make clear how this unity is to be obtained. 1 have attempted<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>this in my book ** The Art of the Theatre ", and now 1 wish to make clear by what<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>process unity is lost.<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>&amp; Let me make a list, (an incomplete one, but it will serve) of the different workers in<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>the theatre. When I have made this list I will tell you how many are head-cooks and how<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>they assist in the spoiling of the broth. <lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>First and foremost, there is the proprietor of the theatre. Secondly, there is the<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>business manager who rents the theatre. Thirdly, there is the stage director,.... sometimes<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>three or four of these. There are also three or four other business men. Then we come<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>to the chief actor and the chief actress. Then we have the actor and the actress who are<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>next to the chief; that is to say, who are ready to step into their places if required.^Then<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>there are from twenty to sixty other actors and actresses. Besides this, there is a gentleman<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>who designs scenes. Another who designs costumes. A third who devotes his time to<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>arranging lights. A fourth who attends to the machinery; (generally the hardest worker<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>in the theatre). And then we have from twenty to a hundred under-workers,.... scene<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>painters, costume makers, lime-light manipulators, dressers, scene-shifters, under machinists<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>extra ladies and gentlemen, cleaners, programme sellers,.... and there we have the bunch.<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>Now look carefully at this list. We see seven heads and two very influential members.<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>Seven directors instead of one, and nine opinions instead of one. JZ?<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>&amp; Now then, it is impossible for a work of art ever to be produced where more than<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>one brain is permitted to direct; and if works of art are not seen in the theatre this<lb facs="P8_TL00045"/>one reason is a sufficient one, though there are plenty more. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00046"/>&amp; Do you wish to know why there are seven masters instead of one? It is because there<lb facs="P8_TL00047"/>is no one man in the theatre who is a master in himself;.... that is to s*iy, there is no one<lb facs="P8_TL00048"/>man capable of inventing and rehearsing a play: capable of designing, and superintending<lb facs="P8_TL00049"/>the construction of both scenery and costume: of writing any necessary music: of inventing<lb facs="P8_TL00050"/>such machinery as is needed and the lighting that is to be used.<lb facs="P8_TL00051"/>&amp; No manager of a theatre has made these things his study; and it is a disgrace to the<lb facs="P8_TL00052"/>Western theatre that this statement can be made. You have but to ask any manager in<lb facs="P8_TL00053"/>London, Berlin or Paris whether he can invent that which is to be presented in his theatre.<lb facs="P8_TL00054"/>Or ask him whether he can invent and design the scenes which are to be shown on his<lb facs="P8_TL00055"/>stage. Or ask him whether he knows anything about historic or imaginative costume; and<lb facs="P8_TL00056"/>whether he knows a beautiful colour from an ugly one. Whether he can even combine<lb facs="P8_TL00057"/>lovely tones and colours together so as to form a whole, and whether he knows anything<lb facs="P8_TL00058"/>of the hand, the wrist, the arm, the neck, and all the rest of the values of the body in<lb facs="P8_TL00059"/>movement. Ask him whether he knows how much light is sufficient to fully illumine<lb facs="P8_TL00060"/>twenty cubic feet, and how much will over light twenty cubic feet and so waste the light.<lb facs="P8_TL00061"/>Ask him if he knows the weight of wood and cloth, or If he can tell you how swiftly or<lb facs="P8_TL00062"/>how slowly a stage floor is able to be raised or lowered. Ask him any of these things, and</ab>

And then<lb facs="P9_TL00003"/>this remarkable master ol the art of the theatre will call up his co-workers, and, pointing<lb facs="P9_TL00004"/>to them, he wiSl say, 44 These are my assistants <lb facs="P9_TL00005"/>&amp; He is not speaking the truth. They are not his assistants, they are his masters. They<lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>lead him with a hook in his nose like the great Leviathon which we see in pictures of the<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>older day pageants. He looks mighty terrible, but he is only made of emptiness covered<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>with paste board. Is not this a fine master? Is not this a pretty way to obtain this same<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>unity, this one thing vital to the art?<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>&amp; So then we have to turn to the six other masters, each of whom help towards the patch<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>work, and see if they will help us to a reasonable answer. The regisseur, or stage-manager,<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>is under the delusion that in truth he is the one who is the artist,.... the inventor.... the<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>master.... but, poor fellow, he is nothing of the kind, for no one is the master: each<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>throwing into the broth whatever ingredient he will. All are petty masters, each hindering<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>the other. Many of the regisseurs or stage-managers are known to me. I have worked<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>with some; others I have spoken with; but all are under the delusion that 1 mention. It<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>is a kind of delusion of despair, for regisseurs are really very good workers and spare<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>themselves no pains when they are in the threatre. They should have spared no pains to<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>prepare themselves for their task, before entering the theatre. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>&amp; As our questions to the director of the theatre met with such a lamentable reply, let<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>us see whether the regisseur, or stage manager, will be able to give us a better answer.<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>Let us ask him.... let us ask any regisseur in Europe or America.... if he can imagine and<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>invent that which is to be presented to the audience; that is to say, the piece, the play, the<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>Idea, or whatever you may call it. Let us ask him whether he can design the scenes and<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>costumes for that piece, and whether he can superintend their construction.... that is to<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>say, whether he knows the secrets of line and colour and their manipulation. Let us ask<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>him whether he can direct without the aid of experts the different workmen who are<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>employed on account of their utility, not on account of their imagination. &amp; And if there<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>is one such man in Europe or America who can reply 4 Yes ' to all these questions, he is<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>the man to whom the control of the stages of Europe and America should be offered; for<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>such a man would be able to train others to acquire the same capacities as himself, for<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>he would know what was necessary. And when you have ten such men in Europe you<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>have a new theatre. But there are not ten as you will find out if you ask. I could not<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>tell you the name of one.<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>And so it is that unity, as I have said, is absent from the art of the theatre. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>&amp; Yet there are several brains in the theatre, who know that if they could find the secret<lb facs="P9_TL00037"/>which would produce this unity they would have discovered a very good thing indeed. In<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>Germany there are a few such men searching in the top-most branches of the tree. But,<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>as they do not think to search at the roots, their search leads them into strange acts. They<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>mean very well, but they act very queerly. They are red hot in the pursuit, but they run<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>blindfold.<lb facs="P9_TL00042"/>&amp; The tendency of these men is to borrow. They borrow from every conceivable source.<lb facs="P9_TL00043"/>They borrow from the painters, they borrow from the architects, the even borrow from<lb facs="P9_TL00044"/>their own fellows, any idea, so long as it is attractive; and so long as the idea has a plain<lb facs="P9_TL00045"/>enough base on which to build a little structure of sense, it is quickly transferred into<lb facs="P9_TL00046"/>the theatre. <lb facs="P9_TL00047"/>&amp; What away for one who wishes to be called an artist to act I Clever artists<lb facs="P9_TL00048"/>illustrating week after week In the comic papers of Germany find their ideas seized on<lb facs="P9_TL00049"/>and thrust upon the stage of the 44 Moderne " theatre. 44 Jugend " decorates Shakespeare<lb facs="P9_TL00050"/>and Bernard Shaw, and 44 Simplicissimus "is useful for Gorky and Wedekind. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00051"/>&amp; These things are experimental and rash innovations, dangerous alike to the art and to<lb facs="P9_TL00052"/>the public. Hastiness characterizes all things in the theatre of today; hasty reforms, hasty<lb facs="P9_TL00053"/>preparation, hasty ideas as hastily carried out. The directors show an eagerness today to<lb facs="P9_TL00054"/>secure the studio painters to design scenes for them. £&gt;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00055"/>How strange this is! Do they not see that they are inviting into their theatre that<lb facs="P9_TL00056"/>which in time will turn and rend it asunder, adding a fresh wound to an already mutilated<lb facs="P9_TL00057"/>corpse.<lb facs="P9_TL00058"/>Do they not also see that to invite the studio painters into the theatre is an insult to those</ab>

Rehearsing in the morning.,., seeing<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>people in the midday.... studying parts.... looking at scenery.... play reading.... attending<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>receptions.... an author to see.... a critic to entertain.... an artist to catch.... incessant<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>quarrels to smooth over.... at least one new play to be brought out each month.... capital to<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>find.... building to superintend.... always one incessant hustle. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>Where, then, is the time to stop and consider about the art of the thing? This may do<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>very well for an oil business or a large grocery; these things thrive by hustling: not so<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>an Art. In this haste all thought of the principles or the beauty of the art is lost sight of<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>and all desire to produce beauty departs. &amp;<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>After all, we must admit that beauty by the side of intrigue is but a poor sort of a thing<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>to follow; and a sort of burlesque intrigue is the goddess of the theatre of today. Burlesque<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>intrigue, that is exactly the class of diplomacy in the theatre.... and how seriously these little<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>imitation diplomatists go about their work!<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>It is very curious to read in De Goncourt's Memoirs of the impression the two brothers<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>received when they wished to honour the theatre by bringing their work on to its stage.<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>Edmond de Goncourt, a true courtier of distinction, surrounded by these burlesque<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>diplomatists of the theatre.... what a picture he paints for us! How keenly we feel, when<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>reading the account of his different interviews with these gentlemen, how vulgar and<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>contemptable the situation must have been. <lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>It horrifies and disgusts me to think that for ever and for ever and for ever such men as<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>De Goncourt, De Musset, Victor Hugo, Dumas, Goethe, Browning, and all the great writers<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>and all the men of truest distinction in the world should be put in such a humiliating<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>position; and not only is it that which disgusts me, but it is shameful that it is ever the<lb facs="P10_TL00044"/>theatre which should put these men in this position. &amp; Must the theatre continually<lb facs="P10_TL00045"/>cry out that it contains none but the fifth rate men? Must the men of the theatre continually<lb facs="P10_TL00046"/>act when in the presence of other artists? And if they act, must they for ever continue to<lb facs="P10_TL00047"/>act ignominiously, so that the whole world cries out, " Behold an actor, and a damn bad<lb facs="P10_TL00048"/>actor into the bargain!" The actor has lately been priding himself that he has raised<lb facs="P10_TL00049"/>himself from the old position when he was held as a vagabond and a thief. This is especially<lb facs="P10_TL00050"/>the case in England. Would to goodness that he had remained a vagabond and a thief,<lb facs="P10_TL00051"/>so that he had not lost his distinction; for to become a gentleman in name, but grow vulgar<lb facs="P10_TL00052"/>to the core, is to be many times worse than a vagabond and a thief.<lb facs="P10_TL00053"/>Let the theatre drop its stupid games of amateur diplomacy. When it does its work itself<lb facs="P10_TL00054"/>there will be no longer need for anything of the kind. When it drops this bad habit it<lb facs="P10_TL00055"/>will have time to attend to the things which are of more importance and it will then have the<lb facs="P10_TL00056"/>spirit to look at things squarely. <lb facs="P10_TL00057"/>But now to return to the tendency to invite the painters and other artists to assist us in<lb facs="P10_TL00058"/>our work, and the haste which characterizes everything we do. &amp; &amp; &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P11_TL00002"/>These two tendencies have driven the best workers out of the theatre. Century after<lb facs="P11_TL00003"/>century the artists of the theatre, despairing of ever seeing the stage awaken from its state<lb facs="P11_TL00004"/>of drunken lethargy, depart from the theatre and go elsewhere. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00005"/>The result Is that today there are no more artists in the theatre. The heads of the theatre<lb facs="P11_TL00006"/>are always men with a certain amount of business capacity; we may; in fact, call them<lb facs="P11_TL00007"/>business men. &amp;£?&amp;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00008"/>The business man employs one or two people who know what a tree looks like as<lb facs="P11_TL00009"/>distinguished from a cat, and of course that is very useful. And so when the business man<lb facs="P11_TL00010"/>wants a tree his workman brings him 0ne.... How simple! When he wants a forest, Say, in<lb facs="P11_TL00011"/>the " Midsummer Night's Dream ", his man brings him one. He does not paint 0ne,... of course<lb facs="P11_TL00012"/>not! That would be risky; risky and difficult. No, he has asked for a forest, and his man<lb facs="P11_TL00013"/>brings him the real and original thing, tree by tree. "There you are, Mr Manager,<lb facs="P11_TL00014"/>there's your forest for you", and Mr Manager replies, "By Jingo, so it is! What a<lb facs="P11_TL00015"/>magnificent artist you are!" And then he runs out into the highways and byways/having<lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>first put on his celuloid cuffs, and says to all his relations and customers; " Walk up,<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>gentlemen! come and look at the scene which 1 have prepared for you! Have you ever seen<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>a scene like that? I flatter myself that nature can't do better...." And his customers<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>gasp. They gasp at the innocence of the man. All they can politely say to him is "It is<lb facs="P11_TL00020"/>very realistic!... " And so through this crass innocence, realism reigns in the theatre.... for<lb facs="P11_TL00021"/>the people are ever polite. £/ &amp; jg?<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>Not only does the manager demand a forest and is supplied with one, but he says to his<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>actors "Why don't you walk about and talk like ordinary beings? Be natural! Be natural!<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>Be natural! " And he will applaud any little mistake like tripping over the carpet, or<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>falling off a chair, if it is an accident, and will say " Oh! Capital! Capital! that's most<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>natural! put that in every evening". Anything to get a sense of chance there. &amp; The<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>idea of make-believe seems to him a preposterous idea when he can get the real thing. &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>In England when he wants an army he sends one of his assistants to bring him half a<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>dozen men from the so and so regiment and puts them into the armour of the Barusch<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>Period. He never thinks of training all his men to appear military as soldiers are. He<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>doesn't reason in that way at all, but keeps on repeating, " What's the good of imitation when<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>you Can get the real article?" &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>And what is the g00d?... If you want the real article. Realism does want the real<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>article, and art has nothing whatever to do with realism. There are people who hold that<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>realism on the stage is not the bringing of real things in front of you. &amp; If it is not this,<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>what is it? &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>Let us try to state. Let us say that when we make a realistic production we aim to put<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>into a semi-real shape that which is already quite real. We aim to invest it with<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>something life-like so that it appears to have a pulse in it, flesh and blood, and to<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>possess other actual qualities. And now one turns to the real thing to find what we<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>have to copy. We gaze long at a face. We see it is not beautiful, that it is not strong,<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>that it is not healthy, and that it is everything which art detests. We look closely at a tree.<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>We see it is in decay, that the leaves are falling, that it is half a skeleton. We look carefully<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>at a building, we are struck by the quantity of bricks used and overcome by the thought<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>of the labor and pain it must have cost to put all the bricks in the right place. And so we<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>find that to look closely at reality is to be terrified by what we see; and, if not terrified,<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>saddened. &amp; How unreasonable it is to say that the artist exists to copy the defects<lb facs="P11_TL00048"/>and blemishes of nature! How ridiculous to say that man is gifted with vision in order to<lb facs="P11_TL00049"/>chronicle faults! To say that faults are beautiful and defects are charming is a platitude.<lb facs="P11_TL00050"/>They may or may not be, but not in Art. Do they perhaps make a work of art more<lb facs="P11_TL00051"/>interesting? 1 think not. One may say only that they are a trifle comic and that Is all.<lb facs="P11_TL00052"/>And so in time realism produces and ends in the comic,.... realism is caricature. The theatre,<lb facs="P11_TL00053"/>with its realism, will end in the music hall, for realism cannot go upwards, but always<lb facs="P11_TL00054"/>tends downwards. Down it goes until we reach the depths And then, Aharchy!<lb facs="P11_TL00055"/>Ariel is destroyed and Caliban reigns. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00056"/>And 1 do not really believe there is very much to be done; not that 1 am at all a pessimist<lb facs="P11_TL00057"/>in regard to the Art, because 1 know well enough that this will emerge unaided in due<lb facs="P11_TL00058"/>time; but there is not very much to be done at present by the people who are now in power</ab>

Besides, that Theatre shows signs of the borrowing fever at a<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>dreadfully high temperature. Then there is also the little art Theatre in Moscow; full of<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>energy, loving realism so well that they even turn realism itself into a joke. Then<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>there is Lugng Poe's "L'Oevre" and Antoine's Theatre, the two solitary efforts of Paris;<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>but how little is achieved can be gauged by the last production by Antoine's of "Julius Caesar".<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>s® If all these little theatre were moving forward in the same direction, all of them having<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>one common idea and following one code of laws, then some little good might be expected<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>because they would all be in unison and in harmony; and the old-fashioned theatre with<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>its plays and its scenery and its real actors would certainly be improved. 4® 4®<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>To expect what ought to happen.... to expect the managers of these theatres to meet in<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>council and to take an oath of allegiance to serve no other Muse but the Muse of their art,<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>no longer to remain in bondage to the Muse of Literature or Painting, but to strike the<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>first new note in honour of their own Goddess.... this ideal hope can only remain a dream,<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>for man is vain and selfish; and besides, the Laws of the Art have not yet been inscribed.<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>And it is because of this, because the Laws have not yet been inscribed, because neither<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>the priests nor the worshippers know the Laws, that all action is useless at present, j®<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>The Laws must be discovered and recorded.

It actually misinterprets our questions " Do you<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>consider Realism and Acting to be a frank representation of human nature?" and<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>" Should the Actor be allowed the same liberty in the expression of the passions as is<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>permitted to the writer and the painter?" It says that these two questions mean 44 Do you<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>approve of nude exhibitions on the Stage?". , &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>The Stage accuses The Mask of being an eccentric journal, but if this is not sheer madness<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>on their part, we should be unable to say what modern English madness is to-day. In our<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>last but one number it is made quite obvious to any right thinking person that realism is<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>abominable, on the Stage, and that to be entirely realistic, even though you are governed<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>by Art, is to be entirely what is called 4 improper'.<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>We only speak about the external part of the realistic exhibitions which those in favor of<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>realism advocate, because the external part of it is the first part to be considered. We<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>come later on to the internal and more subtle things; but if realism will not stand the<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>first test which is brought to it, how mudh less will it stand the later tests? If The Stage<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>is shocked at the idea of a nude Adam in the theatre, then surely it should also be shocked<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>at the idea of the naked thoughts of an Adam, and yet it is not shocked at this: because we<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>have no doubt the writer reads his Bible and his Milton every day (i). &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>When these questions were received by the different gentlemen who were courteous enough<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>to answer them, they, no doubt, said to themselves, " Let us see what realistic representation<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>on the Stage would entail, no matter what the subject should be ". (You probably recollect,<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>Mr Stage, that all subjects are open to the poet and the painter). Then they would probably<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>run through in their minds the different subjects taken both by the poet and the painter. Now<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>we ask The Stage to call to mind those subjects which are most favored by poets and by<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>painters. Prom time immemorial they have been the subjects which we mentioned and which<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>seem to amaze The Stage as something new. Why, surely it is quite a well-known and<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>ancient fact that the stories of Perseus, &amp; Andromeda, of the Annunciation, of Judith and<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>Holofernes, &amp; of The Fall, have been the very first subjects chosen by all painters and poets<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>since they first began to paint and write? Now we were perfectly certain when we started<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>this enquiry that these subjects should Not be put upon the stage, not because it is immoral<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>to represent them, but because it would be ridiculous to attempt such a thing and therefore,<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>knowing how much the opinion of well-known men influences the public mind, we thought<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>we would ask those best entitled to speak on the subject their opinion.<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>The Stage says that the question of nude representations upon the Stage was never put<lb facs="P13_TL00045"/>before these gentlemen; but bless your heart, dear Stage, who ever said it was? But<lb facs="P13_TL00046"/>you cannot deny, try how you may, that the subjects where liberty is allowed the writer<lb facs="P13_TL00047"/>and the painter are the very subjects where the question of nudity does come in. K we<lb facs="P13_TL00048"/>are wrong you must prove your point, but you keep on proving it back-wards at present.<lb facs="P13_TL00049"/>We should say that the best thing is to say nothing more about it, and it will be swiftly<lb facs="P13_TL00050"/>forgotten.... And, by the way, would it be possible for you to stop flattering us by calling<lb facs="P13_TL00051"/>us 'eccentric'? We pray you we implore you don't throw us into the briar bush!</ab>

C. 430-497). That there is as considerable<lb facs="P14_TL00011"/>difference in the classical character of these two works one<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>must at once admit. That the classic element in the Winter's<lb facs="P14_TL00013"/>Tale is overlapped by English medievalism to an extent<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>which is at times startling cannot be questioned by anyone<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>after reading the fourth Act. That quite apart from the<lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>introduction of sixteenth-century English country life there<lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>are strange anachronisms respecting places and people must<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>be conceded. As, for example, the introduction of the Oracle<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>of Delphi as an integral part of the plot, the mention of the<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>Emperor of Russia as Hermione's father, the presence of Julio<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>Romano in Sicily as a painter of sculpture, and the existence<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>of a country with a sea-coast called, Bohemia, and ruled over<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>by a king called Polixenes. Nevertheless, I am not by any<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>means prepared to say with some readers of this play, that<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>it is a comedy quite removed from the sphere of reality. The<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>Italian painter and the Emperor of Russia slip into the text<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>almost unobserved, and but for the picture of the English<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>village festival, together with one or two slight references to<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>costume, we should have a play almost wholly free from<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>anachronism. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>&amp; The important part in the plot played by the<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>Phythia, or priestess, at Delphos recalls a time anterior</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>to 371 B. C., when the oracle was popular; the names of the dramatis persoiiso<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>are Greek down to the names of the shepherdesses and pedlar, and the state of society,<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>divided as it is between two classes—the aristocrat and the labourer—might take us back<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>even to the heroic age. Then for " Bohemia" I would venture to read Boeotia, and so get<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>rid of the geographical difficulty. Finally, as to the English character of the fourth Act,<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>we may bear in mind that a shepherd's life was very much the same in the heroic age as<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>it was in the Elizabethan or any other age; and that the Boeotian poet Hesiod, in the<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>\<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>" Works and Days," gives us pictures of a simple country life very little different from those<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>given us by the English poet in the Winter's Tale. We have, therefore, to choose some<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>date before 371 B. C. for the period of the action. I say 371 B. C., because after this time<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>the Delphic oracle had so far lost its hold upon the public faith, and its old towering influence<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>had been so much reduced by the exhibition of manifest favouritism, that it would hardly<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>have attracted a colony so far removed as Sicily. Nor, on the other hand, must we venture<lb facs="P14_TL00051"/>to go too far back, for fear we reach an art period wherein the extremely realistic painted<lb facs="P14_TL00052"/>statue as we have it suggested in the play would have been impossible—impossible to the<lb facs="P14_TL00053"/>first or Archaic period as a matter of course, impossible to the second or Ideal period<lb facs="P14_TL00054"/>(464-433 B. C.) as a matter of art, which artists at least can readily understand. It is to<lb facs="P14_TL00055"/>the beginning of the naturalistic, or third and last, period of Greek art (430-407) that I would<lb facs="P14_TL00056"/>refer the action of the Winter's Tale; and thus it comes to be bracketed with Timon of Athens,<lb facs="P14_TL00057"/>which is really a Greek history, Timon, the misanthrope, and Alcibialdes, the general of the<lb facs="P14_TL00058"/>Athenian forces, being prominent names in Athenian history from 422-404 B. C. &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00059"/>&amp; &amp; The architectural scenery in the Winter's Tale is Sicilian, and includes.</ab>

The five Scenes<lb facs="P15_TL00009"/>above enumerated may be reduced to four without doing the slightest violence to the text,<lb facs="P15_TL00010"/>and without incurring any archaeological improbability, by uniting Nos. 3 and 4, so making<lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>the court of justice serve for the second Act. Nor would it be very difficult with careful<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>attention to the planning and setting of the scene to reduce the list still further by uniting<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>No. 2 with 3 and 4. Now, although the period of the action belongs to the naturalistic, or<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>clast style of Greek art, it is necessary to remember that a Classic city, as a rule, was no<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>necessarily built in one style, any more than a Gothic town was. That just as London and<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>York, Coventry or Bristol in A. D. 1430 exhibited buildings of a variety of dates up to th<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>purest work of the thirteenth century, and beyond that to at least the middle of the twelfth<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>entury, so in Agrigentum for a century and a half, and in Leontini and Syracuse for three<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>enturief, the builders' hands had been busy before Polixenes came on his unfortunate visit<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>to Leontes. set &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>But whatever variety existed in the proportions of column and entablature, whatever<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>changes and refinements were developed under the indubitable art-culture of the Sicilians,<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>Doric was the prevailing character of the architecture. On public buildings like the temples<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>and palaces, colour, gold and varnish, were lavishly used outside as well as inside when the<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>work was of porous stone and stuccoed, but they were perhaps applied in less quantity when<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>the work was of marble. M. Hittorff, who, in 1823-4 travelled in Sicily in company with the<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>German architects Zanth and Stier, tells us that the body of the walls were painted a pale<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>golden yellow, the triglyphs and mutules blue, the metopes and tympanum red, and on some<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>parts were traces of green, all used in various degrees of intensity. Other antiquaries tell<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>us that " the white marble never remained naked," and that even the portions intended to<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>be white received a transparent coating, that the blue used was of a grey opaque character,<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>that the red was transparent, and that the green was very delicate although bright. The streets<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>were narrow, and were paved with irregular polygons of stone, and every building was not exactly<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>a repetition of a peristylar temple. Indeed the majority of houses appear from Aristophanes<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>to have been very deficient in their internal arrangement, and to have been built on very<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>limited plots of ground. There seem to have been no sanitary provisions of any kind, and the<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>poultry lived, Irish-fashion, in the room where the beautiful Myrrhina carded her wool or<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>plied her distaff. The roofs of many of the houses were flat, and thither the women retired,<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>some to indulge in wine, some to mourn for Adonis (i). The Nestorian house, illustrated in<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>Layard's " Nineveh," may be taken as giving a fair idea of the general appearance of the<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>common class of Greek tenements. But, again, a Greek town was not made up wholly of<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>the lower class of dwellings any more than it was of temples or palaces. In the<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>Thesmophoriazusae and Ecclesiazusae we meet with residences of more than one storey where,<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>too, the women of the house have a distinct suite of rooms to themselves, where some of<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>the upper windows look into the street, and where bay trees and statues shade the entrances.<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>Still with the extension of plan and increase of means here indicated there was scarcely any<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>addition to the walls in the shape of architectural detail. Nor did the ordinary<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>domestic building of Greece partake of anything like what we understand by the words<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>architectural style until a hundred years after the time now under our consideration.<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>The difference between the houses of the lower and the upper classes was one depending<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>chiefly on size, solidity, and paint. The palace of Leontes towards the street might be<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>represented as a massive stuccoed wall of two storeys covered with painted decorations and<lb facs="P15_TL00053"/>pictures, pierced above by plain square windows with folding shutters, and below by a wide<lb facs="P15_TL00054"/>and lofty doorway set in a frame of Doric antee entablature and triple step-raised threshold.<lb facs="P15_TL00055"/>The doors themselves should be folding, with framework of plates of bronze studded with<lb facs="P15_TL00056"/>gold, two large golden rings used as knockers, and numerous square panels filled with ivory<lb facs="P15_TL00057"/>bas reliefs, painted and gilded, and backed by bronze or wood.

Such an addition<lb facs="P16_TL00009"/>to a royal palace might be unusual, although not impossible, for the half circle was a form<lb facs="P16_TL00010"/>of ground plan by no means limited to the uses of the drama. But whichever plan may be<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>selected, there must be no lack of imagery portrayed upon the walls round about—amber<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>colour and ivory, bright red and gold, grey blues and silver, tender green and bronze may<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>all be there. There too we may have curtains of the rich Tyrian purple, covered with<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>embroidery in gold, white and red. The wall paintings might be arranged in two or three<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>rows, the lowermost level being some four or five feet from the floor, The subjects would<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>be taken from the stories of gods and heroes—Aphrodite's envy of Psyche, or the labours<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>of Hercules; how Jason won the guarded fleece of gold, or how Theseus escaped the labyrinth—<lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>whilst some rooms would be wholly given up to the story of the siege of Troy or the<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>wanderings of Odysseus. But unfortunately such scenery as that of the kind here suggested<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>is practically impossible in this generation. We may have artists equal to save the work<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>from being ridiculous, but no manager would be mad enough to pay for it, while actors and<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>actresses work from low motives, are sand-blind to art, and therefore utterly incompetent<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>to act in the poetical drama.<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>&amp; Paulina's house would of course be very Inferior to the royal palace, and yet we must<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>remember that the text indicates a place of refinement, a house where art was honoured,<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>where sculpture was at home, and where the latest and best work was enshrined god-like<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>within a tabenacle, tent, curtain, or velum. These curtains were movable in three ways,<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>drawn aside, by beyng either by being lowered to the floor, or by being raised to the ceiling.<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>They were either of fine wool or thick linen, and some were sumptuous in wealth of lovely<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>colour and woven figure. An open or half open gallery or corridor, the roof resting on squared<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>posts of timber or masses of stuccoed masonry, statues on cylindrical pedestals, a wall with<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>a painted band or two of ornament, a recess for Hermione, and a general amberish tone of<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>colour over all are the chief ingredients for this scene. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>The costume for the Winter's Tale would be so much like that for Timon of Athens,<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>that I defer its consideration until we have gone through the scenery of the latter. </ab>

Here we have Wilde<lb facs="P19_TL00005"/>doing, merely for a bet, what other English<lb facs="P19_TL00006"/>playwrights cannot do even from a sense of<lb facs="P19_TL00007"/>duty \<lb facs="P19_TL00008"/>Although we like the article by the Editor on<lb facs="P19_TL00009"/>Oscar Wilde's repentance, for ourselves we<lb facs="P19_TL00010"/>cannot somehow look upon Wilde in at all<lb facs="P19_TL00011"/>the sane way. What is there so special about<lb facs="P19_TL00012"/>what is called his 44 repentance," or his<lb facs="P19_TL00013"/>sorrow, or his sin or his punishment as<lb facs="P19_TL00014"/>compared with that of other men of equal<lb facs="P19_TL00015"/>greatness? The sins of the world are<lb facs="P19_TL00016"/>extremely broad cast, and the punishment<lb facs="P19_TL00017"/>seldom, thank Heaven, reaches the sinful one.<lb facs="P19_TL00018"/>Alas, on the contrary, how often the blow<lb facs="P19_TL00019"/>dashes out the brains of some unfortunate!<lb facs="P19_TL00020"/>Repentance is very seldom seen,... again thank<lb facs="P19_TL00021"/>Heaven for it; and sorrow!... who has ever<lb facs="P19_TL00022"/>seen sorrow? Surely that pain worthy of the<lb facs="P19_TL00023"/>name is too great to show itself and too<lb facs="P19_TL00024"/>beautiful ever to be described? It so often<lb facs="P19_TL00025"/>degenerates into the maudlin, and that is what<lb facs="P19_TL00026"/>the writers upon Wilde are apt to do. So, from<lb facs="P19_TL00027"/>being painted as the most outrageous<lb facs="P19_TL00028"/>villain of 1895, the picture is now being<lb facs="P19_TL00029"/>touched up to the other extreme and nearly<lb facs="P19_TL00030"/>every other word written about him is sorrow,<lb facs="P19_TL00031"/>repentance, morality, crucified, anguish,<lb facs="P19_TL00032"/>charitable,... all these suggesting far too much<lb facs="P19_TL00033"/>the martyr, which seems foolish towards the<lb facs="P19_TL00034"/>people and really for the first time cruel<lb facs="P19_TL00035"/>towards Wilde. <lb facs="P19_TL00036"/>Of course it is only the natural result of the<lb facs="P19_TL00037"/>stupidity which did not know how to deal<lb facs="P19_TL00038"/>with his case. But it is this very stupidity<lb facs="P19_TL00039"/>which is the culpret and which we yet cannot<lb facs="P19_TL00040"/>dare to treat as the culpret but which we are<lb facs="P19_TL00041"/>obliged to look upon as the patient; this<lb facs="P19_TL00042"/>stupidity which caused the English nation to<lb facs="P19_TL00043"/>oppress Wilde until, as they now see, he is<lb facs="P19_TL00044"/>becoming a veritable hero; whereas Wilde was<lb facs="P19_TL00045"/>not a hero at all, but merely a very remarkable<lb facs="P19_TL00046"/>intelligence and a man whom some considered<lb facs="P19_TL00047"/>a great artist, with, we suppose, a good father<lb facs="P19_TL00048"/>and a good mother and all the advantages of<lb facs="P19_TL00049"/>life and a sincere admiration for Queen<lb facs="P19_TL00050"/>Victoria. &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00051"/>And since we are on the subject of Wilde let<lb facs="P19_TL00052"/>us add here rather a good anecdote which we<lb facs="P19_TL00053"/>have not come across in print although it may<lb facs="P19_TL00054"/>have been told many times. <lb facs="P19_TL00055"/>Wilde was rehearsing one of his plays. He<lb facs="P19_TL00056"/>was trying to persuade an unwilling actor to<lb facs="P19_TL00057"/>do a certain thing in a certain way and the<lb facs="P19_TL00058"/>actor would always do another thing in<lb facs="P19_TL00059"/>another way. At last the actor lost his<lb facs="P19_TL00060"/>temper and in desperation cried out, 44 Look<lb facs="P19_TL00061"/>" here, Mr Wilde, you know you can lead a<lb facs="P19_TL00062"/>44 horse to the brook, don't you know, but<lb facs="P19_TL00063"/>44 you can't make him drink ".44 No ", replied<lb facs="P19_TL00064"/>Wilde, 44 No, but you can make him<lb facs="P19_TL00065"/>44 pretend to! " <lb facs="P19_TL00066"/>The Papyrus also contains an excellent<lb facs="P19_TL00067"/>attack upon Dr George M. Gould, who gets<lb facs="P19_TL00068"/>more pummelling in three pages than he has<lb facs="P19_TL00069"/>probably ever received in his life. It will be</ab>

Until the end of the season<lb facs="P19_TL00108"/>we had the Residentietoneelgeselschap, but<lb facs="P19_TL00109"/>neither the energy and great capacity of Mr<lb facs="P19_TL00110"/>Brondgeest, its leader and chief actor, nor<lb facs="P19_TL00111"/>the youthful talent of Miss Alice Plato and<lb facs="P19_TL00112"/>a few others were able to overcome the<lb facs="P19_TL00113"/>indifference of our public. The Company gave<lb facs="P19_TL00114"/>its performances in a big hall which was never<lb facs="P19_TL00115"/>built for such a purpose, and where the<lb facs="P19_TL00116"/>hearing is bad and the seats uncomfortable.<lb facs="P19_TL00117"/>This may be one of the reasons of Mr<lb facs="P19_TL00118"/>Brondgeest's want of success.<lb facs="P19_TL00119"/>Other companies from Amsterdam and<lb facs="P19_TL00120"/>Rotterdam give performances at the Hague,<lb facs="P19_TL00121"/>but as all are obliged to travel from town to<lb facs="P19_TL00122"/>town with a very large and varied repertoire,<lb facs="P19_TL00123"/>performances are not as a rule prepared as<lb facs="P19_TL00124"/>carefully as would be possible under less<lb facs="P19_TL00125"/>trying circumstances.<lb facs="P19_TL00126"/>In the only theatrical building we have</ab>

Their financial success is<lb facs="P20_TL00008"/>on the whole very doubtful: only operettas<lb facs="P20_TL00009"/>in Dutch translations or in German are always<lb facs="P20_TL00010"/>applauded.<lb facs="P20_TL00011"/>The general public goes to the Royal Theatre<lb facs="P20_TL00012"/>and most of the playgoers content themselves<lb facs="P20_TL00013"/>with the performances given by the royal<lb facs="P20_TL00014"/>company from Amsterdam. Artists and<lb facs="P20_TL00015"/>authors, however,... in fact the greater part<lb facs="P20_TL00016"/>of the more literary and artistic public, do<lb facs="P20_TL00017"/>not generally seek artistic enjoyment there.<lb facs="P20_TL00018"/>Most critics are rather severe about the Royal<lb facs="P20_TL00019"/>Company, which is the only one subsidized<lb facs="P20_TL00020"/>by Her Majesty the Queen. The Government<lb facs="P20_TL00021"/>does not subsidize any theatre.<lb facs="P20_TL00022"/>From time to time a few young artists and<lb facs="P20_TL00023"/>amateurs, desirous of bringing Art on to the<lb facs="P20_TL00024"/>stage, endeavour to please connoisseurs under<lb facs="P20_TL00025"/>the lead of one or two well known actors.<lb facs="P20_TL00026"/>But connoisseurs are few, and as the great<lb facs="P20_TL00027"/>majority of the public only pays attention to<lb facs="P20_TL00028"/>them so long as the enterprise may be<lb facs="P20_TL00029"/>considered as new and more or less a topic<lb facs="P20_TL00030"/>of the day, they do not usually win more than<lb facs="P20_TL00031"/>a passing success. Business men are very<lb facs="P20_TL00032"/>sceptical about these generous attempts to<lb facs="P20_TL00033"/>reform the Dutch stage! Notwithstanding<lb facs="P20_TL00034"/>that scepticism, next season two of these<lb facs="P20_TL00035"/>companies will begin anew to struggle for<lb facs="P20_TL00036"/>Art,... and for life! &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00037"/>As a general rule I may say that all companies<lb facs="P20_TL00038"/>are apt to study Dutch plays somewhat better<lb facs="P20_TL00039"/>and with more care than foreign ones. Not<lb facs="P20_TL00040"/>one of them comes up to the mark in<lb facs="P20_TL00041"/>Shakespeare or in German classics.

Instead of that close imitation<lb facs="P21_TL00012"/>of houses and streets, of rocks and woods,<lb facs="P21_TL00013"/>constructed of plaster and canvas, which has<lb facs="P21_TL00014"/>formed the customary stage-setting, the<lb facs="P21_TL00015"/>scenery in this " Kiinstler-Theater," by being<lb facs="P21_TL00016"/>restricted to the most essential and<lb facs="P21_TL00017"/>characteristic elements, partakes more of the<lb facs="P21_TL00018"/>nature of suggestion than representation.<lb facs="P21_TL00019"/>All the details of the setting are of course<lb facs="P21_TL00020"/>derived from nature, but they are so simplified<lb facs="P21_TL00021"/>and refined in accordance with certain purely<lb facs="P21_TL00022"/>dramatic ideas that instead of a mere crude<lb facs="P21_TL00023"/>imitation of nature a poetic symbolism is<lb facs="P21_TL00024"/>introduced. In this way the scenery, which<lb facs="P21_TL00025"/>often enough is so obtrusive as to divert the<lb facs="P21_TL00026"/>attention of the spectators from the dramatic<lb facs="P21_TL00027"/>proceedings, is kept in the background, and<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>interest can thus be concentrated on the ptay<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>itself. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>This idea is by no means a new one. Even<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>a century ago Goethe and Schinkel advocated<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>a reform in the same sense, and others have<lb facs="P21_TL00033"/>done so since, but only now at Munich are<lb facs="P21_TL00034"/>their views finding practical realisation.<lb facs="P21_TL00035"/>At the inauguration of the theatre Goethe's<lb facs="P21_TL00036"/>" Faust" was given in Eritz Erler's fine<lb facs="P21_TL00037"/>setting, and the enthusiastic reception<lb facs="P21_TL00038"/>accorded to the new mise=&gt;en=&gt;seene of a<lb facs="P21_TL00039"/>drama which offers such an extensive variety<lb facs="P21_TL00040"/>of scene proved the power of these ideas to<lb facs="P21_TL00041"/>carry conviction. The performances which<lb facs="P21_TL00042"/>followed " As You Like It," clothed by Julius<lb facs="P21_TL00043"/>Diez in a joyous, richly garb; the<lb facs="P21_TL00044"/>pastoral play, " The May Queen, " which<lb facs="P21_TL00045"/>H.

For the theatre is<lb facs="P22_TL00029"/>not a business, and as it begins to be looked<lb facs="P22_TL00030"/>upon more and more as a business, so do<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>the receipts begin to decrease and decrease.<lb facs="P22_TL00032"/>Receipts of all kinds.

This treating of the<lb facs="P22_TL00037"/>theatre as a business must stop if the theatre<lb facs="P22_TL00038"/>is to revive not merely as an art, but as an<lb facs="P22_TL00039"/>institution. No art was ever a success in any<lb facs="P22_TL00040"/>way whatever when it began to be treated<lb facs="P22_TL00041"/>in a commercial way.

                                       <lb facs="P22_TL00056"/>tiful day!....<lb facs="P22_TL00057"/>Orofessor Richard Burton, who has been<lb facs="P22_TL00058"/>* lately manifesting much energy as a<lb facs="P22_TL00059"/>speaker on theatrical matters, recently,<lb facs="P22_TL00060"/>according to The New York Dramatic<lb facs="P22_TL00061"/>Mirror, delivered an interesting lecture at<lb facs="P22_TL00062"/>Los Angeles on the Municipal Theatre as<lb facs="P22_TL00063"/>an institution. In this lecture he warmly<lb facs="P22_TL00064"/>advocated its establishment, declaring that<lb facs="P22_TL00065"/>in all cases where the system has been tried<lb facs="P22_TL00066"/>44 it is not only a social and educational<lb facs="P22_TL00067"/>necessity, but it pays".<lb facs="P22_TL00068"/>44 The Anglo-Saxon race " continues Professor<lb facs="P22_TL00069"/>44 Burton, is almost blind, like a bat, to the<lb facs="P22_TL00070"/>44 tremendous social and educational influence<lb facs="P22_TL00071"/>44 of the theatre on modern life. The theatre<lb facs="P22_TL00072"/>44 is one of five great influences apart from the<lb facs="P22_TL00073"/>44 home. The other four are the public library,<lb facs="P22_TL00074"/>44 the church, the newspaper and the school.<lb facs="P22_TL00075"/>44 Except for the theatre, all of these have<lb facs="P22_TL00076"/>44 been enlightened and developed. There is<lb facs="P22_TL00077"/>44 a historical reason why this indifference to<lb facs="P22_TL00078"/>44 the theatre exists. It began with the Puritan<lb facs="P22_TL00079"/>44 prejudice in England, which survives even<lb facs="P22_TL00080"/>44 today. Other nations have not held this<lb facs="P22_TL00081"/>44 prejudice, and have regarded the theatre as<lb facs="P22_TL00082"/>44 an educational power. Many of them have<lb facs="P22_TL00083"/>44 backed it governmentally and subsidized it."<lb facs="P22_TL00084"/>44 Professor Burton ", the Dramatic<lb facs="P22_TL00085"/>Mirror continues, 44 contends that the<lb facs="P22_TL00086"/>44 municipal theatre can be put on a business<lb facs="P22_TL00087"/>44 basis as well as on the basis of social<lb facs="P22_TL00088"/>44 improvement."<lb facs="P22_TL00089"/>The business side of the question we do not<lb facs="P22_TL00090"/>doubt: but it is not clever finance which is<lb facs="P22_TL00091"/>going to save the Theatre: it is Art, and of<lb facs="P22_TL00092"/>that we see little hope in the scheme which<lb facs="P22_TL00093"/>Professor Burton so blithely and confidently<lb facs="P22_TL00094"/>sets forth. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00095"/>Obviously, Professor Burton is an optimist,<lb facs="P22_TL00096"/>and he has a touching belief in the infallibility<lb facs="P22_TL00097"/>of Bumbledom. His idea of the way in which<lb facs="P22_TL00098"/>a city can help the theatre is first, by a mayor's<lb facs="P22_TL00099"/>veto of improper performances; second, by<lb facs="P22_TL00100"/>municipal appropriation and control: and of<lb facs="P22_TL00101"/>course that is all very we 11,... in theory.<lb facs="P22_TL00102"/>But has Professor Burton had much experience<lb facs="P22_TL00103"/>in mayors,... especially provincial ones? Does<lb facs="P22_TL00104"/>he realise that it is an office which, while it<lb facs="P22_TL00105"/>may be held this year by an Earl of Warwick,<lb facs="P22_TL00106"/>may pass next year to a pork butcher, a<lb facs="P22_TL00107"/>pawnbroker or a tailor,... all doubtless<lb facs="P22_TL00108"/>estimable callings, but not those in which we<lb facs="P22_TL00109"/>usually look for men of great culture or<lb facs="P22_TL00110"/>discernment in matters relating to an art?<lb facs="P22_TL00111"/>We have heard that the spirit of Elijah<lb facs="P22_TL00112"/>descended on Elisha through the wearing of<lb facs="P22_TL00113"/>a mantle: we have never yet noted that the<lb facs="P22_TL00114"/>spirit of the artist decended upon an honest<lb facs="P22_TL00115"/>tradesman through the donning of the mayoral<lb facs="P22_TL00116"/>chain. And unless he bring with him the<lb facs="P22_TL00117"/>spirit of the artist, how is the theatre to reap<lb facs="P22_TL00118"/>any benefit from this intervention of the<lb facs="P22_TL00119"/>mayor? &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00120"/>Again, we cannot see eye to eye with Professor<lb facs="P22_TL00121"/>Burton in his second proposition, nor believe</ab>

Jg?<lb facs="P23_TL00013"/>Be that as it may, we have small hope of any<lb facs="P23_TL00014"/>good accruing to the theatre from municipal<lb facs="P23_TL00015"/>control, What reason have we to suppose<lb facs="P23_TL00016"/>that a Mayor and Corporation would prove<lb facs="P23_TL00017"/>more enlightened than the ordinary manager?<lb facs="P23_TL00018"/>If they stood in the place of the manager or<lb facs="P23_TL00019"/>proprietor their aim would doubtless be to<lb facs="P23_TL00020"/>make money, even as his is: Art might then,<lb facs="P23_TL00021"/>as now, have to go to the wall. &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00022"/>We are entirely in accord with Professor<lb facs="P23_TL00023"/>Burton as to the tremendous social and<lb facs="P23_TL00024"/>educational influence of the theatre, but it is<lb facs="P23_TL00025"/>through men, not municipal bodies, that its<lb facs="P23_TL00026"/>possibilities will be realised, and these men<lb facs="P23_TL00027"/>will have to be the artists. &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00028"/>It is by helping the artists individually in<lb facs="P23_TL00029"/>their work, by facilitating, through grants of<lb facs="P23_TL00030"/>money, their studies and their experiments,<lb facs="P23_TL00031"/>that we believe the only means lies by which<lb facs="P23_TL00032"/>the municipality can afford the theatre any<lb facs="P23_TL00033"/>real or adequate aid. jg?<lb facs="P23_TL00034"/>\KJ* hope our readers will excuse us for<lb facs="P23_TL00035"/>* not giving them a quantity of Paragraphs<lb facs="P23_TL00036"/>full of uninforming information.

It tried to be an art journal, and it<lb facs="P23_TL00096"/>could have become one if the actor managers<lb facs="P23_TL00097"/>had not prevented its growth. That was the<lb facs="P23_TL00098"/>result of permitting actor managers to run<lb facs="P23_TL00099"/>the journal.

And also be careful<lb facs="P23_TL00121"/>not to give the credit to the wrong Stage<lb facs="P23_TL00122"/>Manager. There are generally two, and<lb facs="P23_TL00123"/>sometimes a third.

Then<lb facs="P24_TL00018"/>it is that the artist should come in for 3'our<lb facs="P24_TL00019"/>censure. Theatrical critics are greatly at<lb facs="P24_TL00020"/>fault for not ascertaining who is responsible<lb facs="P24_TL00021"/>and who is not. We would be inclined to<lb facs="P24_TL00022"/>suggest that the critics should be invited to<lb facs="P24_TL00023"/>visit an important production during the<lb facs="P24_TL00024"/>rehearsals when they wish, so that they would<lb facs="P24_TL00025"/>be able where the weak places in stage<lb facs="P24_TL00026"/>production come in. Seeing seeing for<lb facs="P24_TL00027"/>themselves, they would be the better able to<lb facs="P24_TL00028"/>criticize, not only the results, but the methods<lb facs="P24_TL00029"/>which lead to those results. JE?<lb facs="P24_TL00030"/>Hphe New York Dramatic Mirror of August<lb facs="P24_TL00031"/>29th, in a paragraph relating to Mr George<lb facs="P24_TL00032"/>Ade, the playwright, tells us that Mr Ade<lb facs="P24_TL00033"/>44 scoffs at the idea that play-writing may be<lb facs="P24_TL00034"/>regarded as an art ". The journal goes on<lb facs="P24_TL00035"/>to quote his own words: &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00036"/>&amp; 44 I don't believe there is a man living<lb facs="P24_TL00037"/>44 who could make a reputation in literature<lb facs="P24_TL00038"/>44 by writing a play. The conditions are all<lb facs="P24_TL00039"/>44 against it. Usually by the time a play is<lb facs="P24_TL00040"/>44 produced there is nothing left of its original<lb facs="P24_TL00041"/>44 form, style or destiny. The author and<lb facs="P24_TL00042"/>44 his manuscript are put through a mangling<lb facs="P24_TL00043"/>44 process that flattens them both first, and<lb facs="P24_TL00044"/>44 after that the actor and the stage manager<lb facs="P24_TL00045"/>44 trim them &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00046"/>Now surely this is a very strong confirmation<lb facs="P24_TL00047"/>of the truth which has been again and again<lb facs="P24_TL00048"/>again proclaimed by writers in The Mask,....<lb facs="P24_TL00049"/>that the art of literature and the art of the<lb facs="P24_TL00050"/>theatre are independent each of the other,<lb facs="P24_TL00051"/>and that any attempt to unite them is to<lb facs="P24_TL00052"/>the loss of both. &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00053"/>If by the time a play is produced there is,<lb facs="P24_TL00054"/>as Mr Ade affirms, 44 nothing left of its<lb facs="P24_TL00055"/>original form, style or destiny it is<lb facs="P24_TL00056"/>obviously harmful to any play to be brought<lb facs="P24_TL00057"/>into the theatre. Why should the playwright<lb facs="P24_TL00058"/>produce a work of art only to have it mangled,<lb facs="P24_TL00059"/>distorted and spoiled?<lb facs="P24_TL00060"/>Of course if it was not a work of art when<lb facs="P24_TL00061"/>it left his hands, and if the new play which<lb facs="P24_TL00062"/>the manager puts on his stage,.... (obviously<lb facs="P24_TL00063"/>new, since it retains nothing of its 44 original<lb facs="P24_TL00064"/>form, style or destiny "), is one, then it seems<lb facs="P24_TL00065"/>to prove that the manager, director, or what<lb facs="P24_TL00066"/>you please to call him, is capable of creating<lb facs="P24_TL00067"/>for himself what is necessary to set upon his<lb facs="P24_TL00068"/>stage, and that so the effort of the playwright<lb facs="P24_TL00069"/>was superfluous. jg?</ab>

When these three Arts shall once again be united, concord shall come<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>again. Oh, then what a Renaissance! . . . the first and final Renaissance!

For pure Beauty is a Silent Beauty, and Silence must<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>return and surround the Arts before they shall become whole again.<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>And have we done Words some injustice?

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>Hphey say that second thoughts are best. They also say it is good to make the best of a<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>* bad job, and it is merely making the best of a bad job that I am forced to alter my first<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>and more optimistic dedication to my second. Therefore the second thoughts are best. What<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>a pity and what a pain to me that we should be obliged to admit it! No such race of athletic<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>workers in the Theatre of today exists; degeneration, both physical and mental, is round<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>us. How could it be otherwise? Perhaps no surer sign of it can be pointed to than that<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>all those whose work lies in the Theatre are to be continually heard announcing that all<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>is well and that the Theatre is today at its highest point of development.<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>But if all were well no desire for a change would spring up instinctively and continually as<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>it ever does with those who visit or ponder on the modern Theatre. It is because the<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>Theatre is in this wretched state that it becomes necessary that some one shall speak as I<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>do; and then I look around me for those to whom I can speak and for those who will<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>listen, and, listening, understand; and I see nothing but backs turned towards me . . . .<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>the backs of a race of unathletic workers. Still the individual, the boy or man of<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>personal courage, faces me. Him I see, and in him I see the force which shall create the<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>race to come. Therefore to him I speak and I am content that he alone shall understand<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>me. It is the man who will, as Blake says, " leave father, mother, houses and lands if they<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>stand in the way of his art"; it is the man who will give up personal ambition and the<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>temporary success of the moment he who will cease to desire an agreeable wealth of<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>smooth guineas, but who shall demand as his reward nothing less than the restoration of<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>his home, its liberty.... its health.... its power.... It is to him I speak.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>VTou are a young man; you have already been a few years in a theatre, or you have been<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>* born of theatrical parents; or you have been a painter for a while but have felt the<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>longing towards movement; or you have been a manufacturer. Perhaps you quarrelled with<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>your parents when you were eighteen, because you wished to go on the stage, and they<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>would not let you. They perhaps asked why you wanted to go on the stage, and you could<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>give no reasonable answer because you wanted to do that which no reasonable answer<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>could explain; in other words you wanted to fly. And had you said to your parents "I<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>want to fly ", I think that you would have probably got further than had you alarmed them<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>with the terrible words, " 1 want to go on the stage. " &amp; JZ&gt; &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>Millions of such men have had the same desire, this desire for movement, this desire to<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>fly, this desire to be mqjrged in some other creature's being, and not knowing that it was<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>the desire to live in the imagination, some have answered their parents, " I want to be an<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>actor; I want to go on the stage". &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00046"/>It is not that which they want; and the tragedy begins. I think when walking, disturbed<lb facs="P7_TL00047"/>with this newly awakened feeling, a young man will say, "perhaps I want to be an actor";<lb facs="P7_TL00048"/>and it is only when in the presence of the irate parents that in his desperation he turns<lb facs="P7_TL00049"/>the •* perhaps " into the definite " I want. "<lb facs="P7_TL00050"/>This is probably your case. You want to fly; you want to exist in some other state, to be<lb facs="P7_TL00051"/>intoxicated with the air, and to create this state in others.<lb facs="P7_TL00052"/>Try and get out of your head now that you really want " to go on the stage. " If unfortunately<lb facs="P7_TL00053"/>you are upon the stage, try and get out of your head then that you want to be an actor and<lb facs="P7_TL00054"/>that it is the end of all your desires. Let us say that you are already an actor; you have been so<lb facs="P7_TL00055"/>for four or five years, and already some strange doubt has crept upon you. You will not admit<lb facs="P7_TL00056"/>it to anyone; your parents would apparently seem to have been right; you will not admit<lb facs="P7_TL00057"/>it to yourself for you have nothing else but this one thing to cheer yourself with. But I'm<lb facs="P7_TL00058"/>going to give you all sorts of things to cheer yourself with, and you may with courage and<lb facs="P7_TL00059"/>complete good spirits throw what you will to the winds and yet lose nothing of that which<lb facs="P7_TL00060"/>you stood up for in the beginning.

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00002"/>I shaH give you the value of my experience for what it is worth, and maybe it will be of<lb facs="P8_TL00003"/>some use to you. 1 shall try to sift what is important for us from what is unimportant; and<lb facs="P8_TL00004"/>if while I am telling you all this you want any doubts cleared or any more exact explanations<lb facs="P8_TL00005"/>or details you have only to ask me for them and I am ready to serve you. &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00006"/>To begin with, you have accepted an engagement from the manager of the Theatre. You<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>must serve him faithfully, not because he is paying you a salary but because you are<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>working under him. And with this obedience to your manager comes the first and the<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>greatest temptation which you will encounter in your whole work.<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>Because you must not merely obey his words but his wishes; and yet you must not lose<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>yourself. I do not mean to say you must not lose your personality because it is probable<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>your personality has not come to its complete form. But you must not lose sight of that<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>which you are in quest of, you must not lose the first feeling which possessed you when<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>you seemed to yourself to be in movement with a sense of swinging upwards.<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>While serving your apprenticeship under your first manager listen to all he has to say and<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>all he can show you about the theatre, about acting, and go further for yourself and search<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>out that which he does not show you. Go where they are painting the scenes; go where they are<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>twisting the electric wires for the lamps; go beneath the stage and look at the elaborate<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>constructions; go up over the stage and ask for informations about the ropes and the wheels;<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>but while you are learning all this about the Theatre and about acting be very careful to<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>remember that outside the world of the Theatre you will find greater inspiration than inside<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>it: 1 mean in nature. The other sources of inspiration are music and architecture.<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>I tell you to do this because you will not have it told you by your manager. In the Theatre<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>they study from the Theatre. They take the Theatre as their source of inspiration, and if<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>at times some actors go to nature for assistance, it is to one part of nature only, to that<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>which manifests itself in the human being.<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>This was not so with Henry Irving, but I cannot stop here to tell you of him, for it would<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>mean letter upon letter to put the thing clearly before you. But you can remember that as<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>actor he was unfailingly right, and that he studied all nature in order to find symbols for<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>the expression of his thoughts.<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>You will be probably told that this man whom I hold up to you as a peerless actor, did such<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>and such a thing in such and such away; and you will doubt my counsel; but with all<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>respect to your present manager you must be very careful how much credence you give to<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>what he says and to what he shows, for it is upon such tradition that the Theatre has<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>existed and has degenerated.<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>What Henry Irving did is one thing; what they tell you he did is another. I have had some<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>experience of this. I played in the same Theatre as Irving in Macbeth, and later on I had<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>the opportunity of playing Macbeth myself in a theatre in the North or the South of England.<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>I was curious to know how much would strike a capable and reliable actor of the usual<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>fifteen years experience, especially one who was an enthusiastic admirer of Henry Irving.<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>I therefore asked him to be good enough to show me how Irving had treated this or that<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>passage; what he had done and what impression he had created because it had slipped my<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>memory. The competent actor thereupon revealed to my amazed intelligence something so<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>banal, so clumsy, and so lacking in distinction, that I began to understand how much value<lb facs="P8_TL00045"/>was in tradition; and I have had several such experiences.<lb facs="P8_TL00046"/>I have been shown by a competent and worthy actress how Mrs Siddons played Lady<lb facs="P8_TL00047"/>Macbeth. She would move to the centre of the stage and would begin to make certain<lb facs="P8_TL00048"/>movements and certain exclamations which she believed to be a reproduction of what<lb facs="P8_TL00049"/>Mrs Siddons had done. I presume she had received these from someone who had seen Mrs<lb facs="P8_TL00050"/>Siddons. The things which she showed me were utterly worthless in so far as they had no<lb facs="P8_TL00051"/>unity, although one action here, another action there, would have some kind of reflected<lb facs="P8_TL00052"/>value; and so I began to see the uselessness of this kind of tuition; and it being my nature<lb facs="P8_TL00053"/>to rebel against those who would force upon me something which seemed to me unintelligent,<lb facs="P8_TL00054"/>I would have nothing to do with such teaching. £/<lb facs="P8_TL00055"/>I do not recommend you to do the same, although you will disregard what I say and do as<lb facs="P8_TL00056"/>I did if you have much of the volcano in you; but you will do better to listen, accept and<lb facs="P8_TL00057"/>adapt that which they tell you, remembering that this your apprenticeship as actor is but<lb facs="P8_TL00058"/>the very beginning of an exceedingly long apprenticeship as craftsman in all the crafts which<lb facs="P8_TL00059"/>go to make up the art.<lb facs="P8_TL00060"/>When you have studied these thoroughly you will find some which are of value and you<lb facs="P8_TL00061"/>will certainly find that the experience as actor has been necessary. The pioneer seldom find<lb facs="P8_TL00062"/>an easy road and as your way does not end in becoming a celebrated actor but is a much<lb facs="P8_TL00063"/>longer and an untrodden way leading to a very different end, you will have all the<lb facs="P8_TL00064"/>advantages and the disadvantages of pioneering; but keep in mind what I have told you;<lb facs="P8_TL00065"/>that your aim is not to become a celebrated actor, it is not to become the manager of a<lb facs="P8_TL00066"/>so-called successful theatre; it is not to become the producer of elaborate and much talked<lb facs="P8_TL00067"/>of plays; it is to become an Artist of the Theatre; and as a base to all this you must, as I have<lb facs="P8_TL00068"/>said, serve your term of apprenticeship as actor faithfully and well. If at the end of five years<lb facs="P8_TL00069"/>as actor you are convinced that you know what your future will be; if, in fact, you are</ab>

And yet we may still discover it, if we have eyes to<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>see, in many a humble booth or cafe in Castile or Andalusia, even yet instinct with life;<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>based as all Spanish art has been on reality, that spiritual passion of the Spanish people;<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>expressing itself no longer in the work of Morales, of Velasquez, of Murillo, in the lucid<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>and perfect syllables of Calderon, the pathos and humour of Cervantes, the eloquence of Lope<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>de Vega, the life of S. Teresa, but in the perfect and almost terrible gestures of the dance,<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>the beauty and pathos of the folk song, born there before your eyes in some dim cafe of the<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>people.<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>Those strange songs, half chant, half love-song, lyrical so sullenly, so sadly almost, and with<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>a new sort of rhythm that is in reality but the oldest music of all, greet you everywhere<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>in Southern Spain; and strangely enough, as we may think of anything so difficult for the<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>modern ear, are more popular than the national songs, are indeed fast taking their place<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>with the people even in so conservative a country as La Mancha. Malaguenas they call them,<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>songs of Malaga; and indeed in Malaga you hear almost nothing else. Sung to the guitar, the<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>strings have often a more important place in them than the voice itself; for after a long<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>introduction in which you learn, perhaps for the first time, the extraordinary beauty that<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>may be drawn by skilful fingers from an instrument seemingly so limited, the voice breaks<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>in suddenly, on a high note long drawn out, almost startling in its fierceness, its profound<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>and passionate sadness. It is like some tragic thing that has befallen in the desert, like a<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>mood of the soul that has at last become unbearable agony, that must express itself: like<lb facs="P9_TL00037"/>a sudden apprehension of fate which is about to overwhelm everything. Gradually, with many<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>swift or reluctant turns, the voice descends into the melody itself, almost a Gregorian tone,<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>and yet without the assurance, the precision of that chant which is the foundation of everything<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>that has been accomplished in music since the sixth century, and it may be even before that,<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>and which in its perfect intervals assured Europe of her musical future. But while something<lb facs="P9_TL00042"/>may be found in the simpler Malaguenas, certainly, of the third Gregorian tone, it is really<lb facs="P9_TL00043"/>a music more primitive than the plainsong that you come upon, quite by chance, in the<lb facs="P9_TL00044"/>cities of Andalusia. That it has much in common with Greek music, perhaps through the<lb facs="P9_TL00045"/>Moor, perhaps through the Phoenician, is, I think, capable of proof; but whether it be more<lb facs="P9_TL00046"/>than the common likeness that is to be found in all primitive music, in the resemblance,<lb facs="P9_TL00047"/>for instance, that you may discover in so northern a thing as an old Scottish air to the Eastern<lb facs="P9_TL00048"/>music of swords and gongs accompanying a plaintive sort of chant, in the likeness of the<lb facs="P9_TL00049"/>curious wail of the bagpipe itself to much Arab music, it is difficult to determine; for indeed<lb facs="P9_TL00050"/>almost nothing has been written, by musicians at any rate, of the Malaguena, and it is only<lb facs="P9_TL00051"/>with difficulty you may find one noted down truly, or as truly as may be, in modern<lb facs="P9_TL00052"/>notation, (i)<lb facs="P9_TL00053"/>You come upon this music quite by chance, I said, in speaking of the Malaguena; and indeed<lb facs="P9_TL00054"/>that is one of its greatest delights; it is almost always by chance that you hear them. Here<lb facs="P9_TL00055"/>in Malaga, for instance, not one traveller in a thousand ever discovers the Chinitas, that<lb facs="P9_TL00056"/>little caf6 in the Caleta, which is certainly, in its irresponsible perverse way, the one real<lb facs="P9_TL00057"/>school of art in Spain. There, it is true, you may hear the Malaguena sung or danced or</ab>

Yes, within those dingy, disreputable walls, something seems to have<lb facs="P10_TL00008"/>been expressed, to have escaped from its captivity; and yet, while you have still all the<lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>colour and passion of so rare a thing, some nuance, I know not what, I know not why, seems<lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>to have vanished away, to have lost itself in that narrow room, so that really the song is<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>less beautiful there than when sung on the quays or in some patio at midday.<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>There are other arts besides those of singing and dancing that you will find at the Chinitas,<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>better almost than anywhere else in Spain: the art of poetry, for instance, really, in its<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>primitive form, a kind of impromptu wrung from the poet half intoxicated by music, by the<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>curious giddy madness of the castanets. Peculiar, it might seem, to a land so languid about<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>art as Spain, so little aware of anything that it has not made its own, so indifferent to mere<lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>beauty, so anxious for life, these curiously fascinating moments in which you may see, as<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>it were, the very art of the poet practised before you, the delicate handling of words that<lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>have really been born out of a vision, are to the Spaniard in their excitement, in their<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>rather terrible energy, their extraordinary promise of beauty, much akin to the more brutal<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>but not less eager moments of the bull-fight, when some extraordinarily beautiful feat of<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>sword play or daring is about to take place. &amp;<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>Through a frankly noisy crowd full of laughter, amid all the freedom of the cafe, two women<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>and an old man thread their way to a sort of platform at the end of the room. One of the<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>women, old and ugly, and yet not without that distinction which seems always to wait on<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>old age here in Spain, sits beside the old man, who tunes his guitar at the back of the stage;<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>the other, still young, with a sad and eager face, sits before them on a chair, alone, facing<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>the noisy crowd. For a minute or two the old man continues to tune his guitar, and then<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>quite suddenly he strikes a beautiful and suggestive chord that dies away into a kind of<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>chant, played with much art on that instrument, so little known out of Spain. The old woman<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>beats time with her foot, clapping her hands, and from time to time uttering strange cries:<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>cries that, in some way 1 cannot explain, seem to excite that motley crowd, which has<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>suddenly grown so silent, till they, too, are full of eagerness, of energy. Now and again<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>from among them some one cries out in answer. The girl seated alone in the midst of the<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>stage seems to be asleep, a sort of drowsiness has overwhelmed her; her arms hang listessly at<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>her sides, her head has fallen on her breast. Still the old woman beats her hands together<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>passionately, angrily almost; her cries seem to burst from a heart, full of rage and fury, that<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>is about to break. Now and then the girl rocks a little in her chair, the old man continues<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>his endless melody, passionate and sad, on the guitar. An immense seriousness has fallen<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>upon the crowd. Near me is a woman, her hand lying in the hand of a man, still young,<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>who sits beside her; there are tears in her eyes, and his fingers have ceased to press hers;<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>he has forgotten her, he is waiting almost with anxiety for something to declare itself, for<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>revelation, it might seem. Everywhere around me are eager faces, that for a moment seem<lb facs="P10_TL00044"/>to have lost the harshness that daily life has pressed upon them, that have forgotten<lb facs="P10_TL00045"/>everything, and have attained to a sort of simplicity that you may often find in the faces<lb facs="P10_TL00046"/>of those who are sleeping. The figure in the midst of the stage seems almost to have collapsed,<lb facs="P10_TL00047"/>to have fallen on to itself, and then, suddenly, as the old woman furiously cries out, and<lb facs="P10_TL00048"/>in frenzy beats her hands together with a kind of menace, almost threatening in its intensity,<lb facs="P10_TL00049"/>a shiver passes over the girl, the red carnation in her black hair trembles, in a moment a<lb facs="P10_TL00050"/>mask seems to have fallen from her face; her eyes are wide open, dilated, her mouth widens,<lb facs="P10_TL00051"/>becomes almost immense, almost terrible in its effort of articulation; closes a little, and<lb facs="P10_TL00052"/>becomes beautiful as she is about to utter the beautiful words; and then, as it were, thrusting<lb facs="P10_TL00053"/>back the excited, panting crowd with her hands, at last she speaks: &amp;</ab>

And since<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>it is chiefly of women that the traveller is compelled to think in this beautiful city that is<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>full of them, where in the narrow streets you feel the wind of their shawls, on the Triana<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>bridge where you are caught by the sensuous and profound rhythm of their movement, in<lb facs="P11_TL00020"/>Triana itself where you are surprised by their sullen smouldering beauty, a little stupified<lb facs="P11_TL00021"/>by dust and sun, in the Palacios where you feel the cold passion of every gesture, every<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>glance, or in the Alcazar where you are overtaken by the memory of one who walked or<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>bathed there long and long ago, and plucked the flowers and was much beloved, and even<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>in the Cathedral where on all sides Murillo's Madonnas, full of a distracting and sensual<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>loveliness, smile, and smile pathetic in temptation; it is at last as a divine woman, sufficient<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>for us and yet so unsatisfying, full of sweetness that is about to become wearying, that you<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>come to think of the city herself. If you go to the Alcazar, for instance, expecting some great<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>and stern beauty, some altogether strong and lovely thing, you will be disappointed;<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>everywhere you will find flowers that whisper together as though some one had but just passed<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>by, and as you enter room after room, court after court, patio after patio, full of silence and<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>sunlight, you will almost hear the footsteps of someone who has but just gone out, leaving a faint<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>trace of some presence in an inexplicable trouble on the threshold, a suggestion of scent in<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>the air, the trembling of a curtain that has just felt the touch of a hand, a fading breath<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>on the window-pane through which some one has glanced a moment before, a blossom fallen<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>on the pathway, the fluttering of a leaf on a tree where some one has just plucked a fruit.<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>And you remember that Maria Padilla often passed through these gardens, that under these<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>very trees she trembled in the arms of her lover, that these cold pavements have felt the<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>tenderness of her feet, this marble the wealth and sweetness of her body. j® j®<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>And seeing that Seville is so full of the memory of women, of women's laughter like the<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>song of a bird full of delight, that you may often hear in the evenings in Triana, of the<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>voices of women singing children to sleep, of their hands that float like lilies in the Sevillana<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>dance, of their movements full of languor and grace, it is after all just their delight which<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>is the charm of the city herself, an infinite variety in which you will find everything you<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>desire. Something pensive, spell-bound, but half-real in the strait, winding Moorish streets,<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>the delicate, sleeping patios, through which the moonlight creeps like a ghost, combines<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>inconsequently but not unfortunately at all with the melancoly of the Fabrica or the Pottery<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>sheds, the romance of the busy Guadalquivir, the noise and beauty of the quays, the groups<lb facs="P11_TL00048"/>of foreign sailors you may see there; while the freedom of the sulky gipsies of Triana, who<lb facs="P11_TL00049"/>seem ever about to cry out at you or to spring upon you, contrasts strangely enough with<lb facs="P11_TL00050"/>the dignity and seclusion of the women of Andalusia, their immense ennui and calmness, as<lb facs="P11_TL00051"/>it were, their look of exhausted delight, stupefied by their own stupidity. j® j®<lb facs="P11_TL00052"/>And so in the spring or autumn evenings, and in winter too, if after the strangely elaborate<lb facs="P11_TL00053"/>frugality of the Spanish dinner you enter the Cafe de Novedades, for instance, you may see<lb facs="P11_TL00054"/>the Andalusian women dancing very beautifully, though a little wearily, to the clapping of<lb facs="P11_TL00055"/>hands, the throb of the guitar, the eagerness of the castanets. Just there, I think, you will<lb facs="P11_TL00056"/>find the most perfect and the most natural expression of life in Andalusia. It is not a joyful<lb facs="P11_TL00057"/>thing at all, this strange, vivid struggle, in a dance that is like a battle in the soul that<lb facs="P11_TL00058"/>has communicated itself to the flesh. It is really a passianate, almost a religious, expression<lb facs="P11_TL00059"/>of life, full of an extraordinary seriousness that will produce tears rather than laughter. It<lb facs="P11_TL00060"/>is as though in those few subtle movements of the body an art very racy and national a<lb facs="P11_TL00061"/>dying art, it is true, but the only one left in Spain that is even yet alive, had sought to<lb facs="P11_TL00062"/>sum up and express, as it were, in a beautiful allegory, the fundamental truths of life, of love,<lb facs="P11_TL00063"/>of the creative enthusiasm of man, so pitiful, so involuntary. The dancer stands before her<lb facs="P11_TL00064"/>fellows who are seated in a semicircle behind her; she wears a long dress that falls infolds<lb facs="P11_TL00065"/>to the ground. After a time, while some sing intermittently, some now and then play a guitar,<lb facs="P11_TL00066"/>some beat time with their hands and stamp with their feet, she begins to dance to the<lb facs="P11_TL00067"/>maddening thunder of the castanets. It is a dance of the body, of the arms, of the fingers,<lb facs="P11_TL00068"/>of the head, in which the feet have almost no active part. At first she stands there like a</ab>

Suddenly she trembles, something<lb facs="P12_TL00006"/>seems to have towered in her heart and to be about to burst into blossom. Her whole body<lb facs="P12_TL00007"/>is shaken in ecstasy; wave after wave of emotion, of pure energy, as it were sweeps over<lb facs="P12_TL00008"/>her limbs; she is like a rose at dawn that, gazing at the sunrise, has shaken the dew from<lb facs="P12_TL00009"/>the cup of its petals, trembling with adoration. Her head leans on her shoulder, she is<lb facs="P12_TL00010"/>awakening, the castanets have awakened her; she undulates her hips almost imperceptibly.<lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>Life has caught her in his arms, he has strained back her head; slowly she has opened her<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>eyelids, she rounds her arms as though to embrace him, she holds out her mouth heavy<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>with an ungiven kiss. Without moving her feet, without bending her knees, slowly she turns<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>her body to follow him. At first she dances gravely, intermingling her beautiful arms; her soul<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>suffers in her her body suffers in its sheath, she breathes deeply, she cannot close her<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>eyelids, and her mouth is like a red rose about to fall. She strains voluptuously, she is free; her<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>body is all joyful, is overwhelmed by the splendour of joy; it is as though she were caught<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>in a profound and serious laughter. With an immense energy life possesses her, wrings from<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>her cries that are as lamentable as those of women at child-birth, cries that are drowned<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>in the thunder of innumerable hands, hands that seem to stretch forth eagerly to touch<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>life as it passes. Slowly she seems to subside into herself, the undulations of her body grow<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>less and less violent; she seems to be weeping, she seems about to fall, she is quite still;<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>it is finished. In a fierce frenzy, serious, grave, and passionate, the thunder of applause,<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>mingled with extraordinary and beautiful cries, grows and dies away into silence in the<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>shabby room.<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>Just there it seems to me Seville is in her most characteristic mood, finding in so trivial a<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>thing as the dance seems to us to be, a means of expression for the most profound simplicities<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>of Nature; dancing being, indeed, the only expression of life for which she cares, since it<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>sums up, as it were, all the rest in its symbolism, and in its perfect marriage of matter and<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>form shadows forth in a mortal minute the whole activity of man. &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>t</ab>

Indeed, people are even prevailed upon to<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>smile on reading In the Bible that King David danced among the women before the Ark. They<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>picture to themselves a fancy King David attired either as a powder puff or a bear, whirling<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>or lumbering round on a dusty road .... probably uphill. Why, the thing is inconceivable!<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>It Is no use for the Royal Academicians to draw a picture of the famous Artist-King as<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>sedately advancing with a harp In his hands like a courtier of the time of Louis XIV.<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>Here again the thing becomes inconceivable; and as the imagination of man is not very<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>brilliant, It stands to reason that people give up the Idea of serious and beautiful dancing<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>as having really existed, and fall back Into the modern distortion. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>jg? The case Is even worse with Pantomime. At the best the world conceives pantomime to<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>foe what the French actors are so good at and at the worst they think it is Clown and<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>Pantaloon. French actors are amusing and delightful; Clown and Pantaloon are entrancing,<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>hut these beings are undoubtedly not the exponents of the Art of Pantomime. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00045"/>So if you point out the case of Buddah teaching symbolic gesture or 45 Pantomime " to his<lb facs="P13_TL00046"/>pupils the world will Instantly think of Harlequinade or of 44 L'Enfant Prodigue and,<lb facs="P13_TL00047"/>dressing Buddah, (in their mind's eye) In coloured, diamond-patterned tights or the loose<lb facs="P13_TL00048"/>white costume of Pierrot, will giggle as they try to foe serious about it all. &amp; jg?<lb facs="P13_TL00049"/>The Marionnette, too; mention him in good society, even in learned society, and the rewill<lb facs="P13_TL00050"/>foe an awkward moment or two. It seems that he has become one of those things that one<lb facs="P13_TL00051"/>must not mention; - like the novels of Dumas, he Is only for boys and girls; and if you remind<lb facs="P13_TL00052"/>anyone that he figured In the Feast of Bacchus when the Egyptians celebrated these rites,<lb facs="P13_TL00053"/>people will instantly think of a poor doll tied to a stick and resembling nothing so much<lb facs="P13_TL00054"/>as Aunt Sally. If you remind people of what Mr Anatole France writes of these strange and<lb facs="P13_TL00055"/>wonderful beings, the Marionnettes, they will probably put Mr Anatole France down as an<lb facs="P13_TL00056"/>eccentric gentleman. He happens to be an artist and knows about what he is speaking, so<lb facs="P13_TL00057"/>let us hear what he sayss .. . &amp; J&amp; &lt;&amp;?<lb facs="P13_TL00058"/>44 J'ai vu deux lots fes marionnettes de la rue Vivienne, et j'y ai pris un grand plaisir.

He has two masks and on each mask one<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>main statement, these statements being tempered by Reflections,... the hopes and fears and<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>the rest of not merely the Judge, but of Justice and Injustice ". &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>Craig "aims at taking us beyond reality; he replaces the pattern of the thing itself by<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>the pattern which that thing evokes in his mind, the symbol of the thing ". In saying this<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>Arthur Symons recognises in Craig a descendent of the family of the ancient artists of the<lb facs="P14_TL00051"/>Theatre, for his aim was theirs, and the Mask a part of their strength, the Mask, the<lb facs="P14_TL00052"/>symbol of the Human face. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;/<lb facs="P14_TL00053"/>It is this sense of being beyond reality which permeates all great art. We see it in the<lb facs="P14_TL00054"/>little clumsily painted pictures of those periods when the true beyond was of more importance<lb facs="P14_TL00055"/>than a right perspective, when the perspective of thought and feeling held its true value.<lb facs="P14_TL00056"/>We see it in the marvellous little Etruscan figures of but an inch high! one faces me as<lb facs="P14_TL00057"/>I write, a tiny little piece of bronze, charged with an overwhelming spirit, but which<lb facs="P14_TL00058"/>would be refused at the Royal Academy of today because its hand is as big as its head and<lb facs="P14_TL00059"/>the toes of the feet are not defined; because it does not wriggle itself into a pose, but is<lb facs="P14_TL00060"/>poised with firm conviction,... conviction, a thing detested by committees and hence refused<lb facs="P14_TL00061"/>admission in Academies. jg? jg? &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00062"/>Masks carry conviction when he who creates them is an artist, for the artist limits the<lb facs="P14_TL00063"/>statements which he places upon these masks. The face of the actor carries no such<lb facs="P14_TL00064"/>conviction: it is over full of fleeting expression,.... frail, restless; disturbed and disturbing,<lb facs="P14_TL00065"/>and, as Craig says elsewhere, on this account not material with which to make a work of art.<lb facs="P14_TL00066"/>JZ? It is doubtful whether the actor will ever have the courage to cover his face with a mask<lb facs="P14_TL00067"/>again having once put it aside, and it is doubtful whether he shall see that it would serve as<lb facs="P14_TL00068"/>his gain. If it can be proved that it would be to the actor's loss and not his gain it will<lb facs="P14_TL00069"/>prove that the Actor and the Art of the Theatre are divided at the outset, and one of three<lb facs="P14_TL00070"/>things will happen: either the Actor will drift further from the Art, or he will be destroyed<lb facs="P14_TL00071"/>in battling against the Art, or, finally, he will, like the phoenix, destroy himself to re form</ab>

Some time<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>ago, we do not know how far back, (the collector knows) the world became tired of creating<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>and took unto itself the rage for the old fashioned.<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>"Pictures.... away with the young painters: let us fill our houses with the old paintings; drag<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>them out of the churches, dig them out of the niches, scrape them off the walls; what does<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>it matter! Hateful young men! Lovely old masters!"<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>"Sculpture.... quick, fly to Greece! Now's the time! Nobody's looking,... occupied with<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>affairs,... no money in the country; a lot of money in the ground; dig it all up; let sculpture<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>go to the dogs, and let the old remains come back from Athens to fill our collections ".<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>"Music.... some young musician wants his symphony played. Nonsense, costs too much; have<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>discovered splendid new piece in little old shop for one fife and a drum; never heard anything<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>like it before! Wonderful discovery! Tell the young man to take up chemistry". <lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>And so on and so on. &amp; This craze for the antique has become a general habit, and the<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>more antique the more the craze. Old furniture, houses packed with old furniture; books,<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>tapestries, all sorts of metal work, even down to coins, though here the true collector,<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>the millionaire, is careful to keep as modern as he can. And this love of the antique is growing<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>so petty to-day that it is positively eating into the very people themselves and they are becoming<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>as antique as that which they collect: with this difference, that the old stuff has life in it<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>and they have none. This love of the antique has come into the Theatre now and then; it<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>entered into England with William Poel and his Elizabethan Stage Society. Those who know<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>Mr Poel know him to be a man of distinction, cultivated, and an authority upon the stage<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>of the 16th century. But what is that for the purpose of the living Theatre? All those connected<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>with the stage should be distinguished and cultivated, and authorities on all questions<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>pertainining to the stage; but they should possess that only as a basis, and on that basis<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>they should build anew and not merely exhibit the basis itself, saying, " Lo, the ruins of<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>the 16th century! tickets 6d; plan of excavation, 2d extra". There have been others besides<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>Mr Poel. There have been the revivalists of the so-called Greek Theatre,... a dreadful thing<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>entirely in Greek; and so on.<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>It would be a sad thing, therefore, if masks, sham-Greek in idea, sham-Greek in their<lb facs="P15_TL00053"/>manufacture, should be brought into the Theatre, appealing to the curious only by creating<lb facs="P15_TL00054"/>a subject for small talk. No! the Mask must return to the Stage to restore expression, .. .<lb facs="P15_TL00055"/>the visible expression of the mind. <lb facs="P15_TL00056"/>There is a second danger, ... the danger of the innovator. As Art must not be antique,<lb facs="P15_TL00057"/>neither can it be up-to-date. I think it is Mr Whistler who points out that Art has no period<lb facs="P15_TL00058"/>whatever. It has only vitality or affectation, and under 4 affectation' come both the imitation<lb facs="P15_TL00059"/>of the antique and the up-to-date. jgr &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00060"/>The vitality of the Art depends upon its artists and their willingness to work under the Laws<lb facs="P15_TL00061"/>which have ruled their Art from the commencement. Not Laws put down by committees to<lb facs="P15_TL00062"/>suit a period, but the commandments unspoken and uninscribed, the ever-living Law of<lb facs="P15_TL00063"/>Balance which is the heart of perfect Beauty and from which springs Freedom,.... that<lb facs="P15_TL00064"/>Freedom which we hope and believe is the soul of Truth. To move incessantly towards this<lb facs="P15_TL00065"/>is the aim of artists, and those of the Theatre must not lag behind. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00066"/>As has been said many times before, this will be nothing new. It is what the men of the<lb facs="P15_TL00067"/>Theatre began thousands of years ago: it is what the men of the Theatre a few hundred years<lb facs="P15_TL00068"/>ago relinquished as beyond their strength. When we shall resume this we shall not be<lb facs="P15_TL00069"/>merely repeating: it will be no echo of a past century: the inspiration which led men to use<lb facs="P15_TL00070"/>the mask in past ages is the same now as it ever was and will never die. It is this inspiration<lb facs="P15_TL00071"/>that we shall act under and in which we trust. Therefore let no one attempt to put this<lb facs="P15_TL00072"/>thing aside as being of the antique, or an eccentric explosion of 44 I'Art Nouveau ". I anticipate</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00004"/>the charges so as to call attention to the class of person who is sure to have something to<lb facs="P16_TL00005"/>say against us. We all know the kind of individual who is continually heard laughing to-scorn<lb facs="P16_TL00006"/>the vitality of his country and his age. He is an unhealthy creature and I am glad to find that<lb facs="P16_TL00007"/>in England lie is already beginning to die out. For the last seven years a new spirit has<lb facs="P16_TL00008"/>awakened in England and everything is coming under its influence. There is a gaiety abroad<lb facs="P16_TL00009"/>and a sense of freedom which loosens the Joints of our island and which gives to our dignified<lb facs="P16_TL00010"/>and solemn people an added grace of which they were much in need. Let the young men<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>of the Theatre remember this and stand at ease, for there is a protective spirit abroad whom<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>they can look to when they need support. No longer a stiff courtesy reigns in the Court,<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>but a genial one;... one which I believe is friendly to all things young and vital,... which<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>3 hope is not to forget the young and vital Art of the Theatre. &amp; &amp;</ab>

Others will cry out that it is<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>astonishing that this actress is able at will to become pale as only those who are fainting<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>become pale. Others will write of the unfailing taste which controls every thought and every<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>action of this actress. A fifth, comparing her with Sarah Bernhardt, will speak of the marvellous<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>reserve of her acting and its veracity, and, while stating that Sarah Bernhardt leaves nothing<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>to chance and is scientific in her methods, will praise Eleonora Duse as the greater actress<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>for being always swayed by the feeling of the moment. A sixth speaks of her acting as seeming<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>to come from a great depth and to be only half telling profound secrets..... 44 No play 44,<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>says this writer, 44 has ever been profound enough and simple enough for this woman to say<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>everything she has to say in it. " This last writer gets nearer to the secret the little<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>nothing of a secret of Eleonora Duse, yet he writes about her as an 44 actress " as do<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>the others, whereas it seems the only way to write about Eleonora Duse is as a woman.<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>She has nothing of art in her composition. She abhors all that goes to make up great art....<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>that is to say, the obedience to laws which are impersonal and immortal. She is personal<lb facs="P16_TL00038"/>love, personal courage, personal hope, and personal beauty, and these all whirl her through<lb facs="P16_TL00039"/>the long space of her' life as some unseen and lonely star is whirling at this moment above<lb facs="P16_TL00040"/>our heads. &amp; &amp;&amp; &lt;£?£?&amp;?&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;?<lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>Mow childlike and simple is it of these men who would learn Sier small secret innocently to<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>enter the theatre, each on a different night, and each of them to think that he is looking<lb facs="P16_TL00043"/>at the same thing! When I think of Eleonora Duse on the stage in front of the world, I see,<lb facs="P16_TL00044"/>as it were, a lonely yet hopeful figure, draped in some ineffable charm to hide its loneliness,<lb facs="P16_TL00045"/>and appealing to the men who sit there like boys at school. Some are humbled, some are<lb facs="P16_TL00046"/>studious, some tremble with a sort of repressed excitement, some sit wondering; but none<lb facs="P16_TL00047"/>of them seem to hear what she is crying out, and that cry seems to be, 4 Release me, release<lb facs="P16_TL00048"/>me from this agony; unchain me from this rock to which Fate has bound me; kill all<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>these hideous monsters which wait to devour me !,y. &amp; &amp; &amp; jg?<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>And even now I pretend not that 8 have found tSie secret of Eleonora Duse. 1 am not able to<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>believe that I could ever solve that vast problem. I come somewhere near it when I say<lb facs="P16_TL00052"/>that may be there is no problem to solve. But rather than commit myself to so great a<lb facs="P16_TL00053"/>vanity I must perforce address myself to other things and first to the consideration of<lb facs="P16_TL00054"/>the evil which comes to our Art by connecting such wonderful people and the term 4 Artist'<lb facs="P16_TL00055"/>together.<lb facs="P16_TL00056"/>No one can seriously call an actor or actress an artist off the Theatre; and as no one can</ab>

To an artist nothing Jess than perfection will do. An artist will<lb facs="P17_TL00005"/>sooner never commence his work than end with it in an imperfect state. An artist is<lb facs="P17_TL00006"/>unselfishness personified. He lives for an ideal, and for that ideal everything else in the<lb facs="P17_TL00007"/>world is destroyed. An artist is never to foe heard saying " I should like to but only " I<lb facs="P17_TL00008"/>will And what is it he wills? It is, as I have said, perfection, perfection, and nothing short<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>of perfection. &amp;/&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;?&amp;&lt;£?&amp;&amp;/&amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>No man or woman in the theatre of today wills such perfection. Each actor and actress,<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>each manager, each scene painter carries in his being a soul of compromise. Rather than<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>be in a fix himself he will put his art in a fix. All the workers in the theatre, from the<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>greatest to the lowest, feel that they have to be incessantly active, showing something,<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>whether ready or not ready, and it is always a case of not ready.<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>With the actor, he brings his own part up to a certain incomplete perfection. He knows his<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>own lines, he knows how much emotion to pour into them, and having done this he thinks<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>he has created a work of Art. He has not done so: he has been content with very much less<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>than the least perfection he is not an artist: and this wonderful woman, Eleonora Duse,<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>she, too, is content with less than perfection. This is the rock to which she is bound.<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>If this were not so, with the force and the beauty, and, as we believe, the strength, which<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>is in her, she could create a state in which the creation of a work of art might become<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>possible.<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>Let me at once say that this spirit of force and beauty would not use its person, fingers, or<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>hands to fashion this work of art, and would forever put aside the thought of such a deed<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>as unnatural. &lt;£? It is love which creates, and nothing except love will ever create.<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>The man or woman who greatly and entirely loves the art of the Theatre, with a love in<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>which no grain of selfishness lingers, but which is surrounded by circles of pride, such a one<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>can heal the theatre can restore vitality to its poor and broken body and can then perform<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>The Miracle with its soul.^<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>And what a love is this! how white and crystal hot, the passion with which a man as lonely as<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>he is great, might, phoenix like, consume himself while creating a new life and beauty from<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>his own destruction. And how much more might a woman do this!<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>Not to descend and with feminine hands attempt the work of men, and in meddling with<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>these beautiful hands, spoil all the fingers by fingering all the spoils; not to descend among<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>us, the workmen at the anvil, except in the momentary Vision, but to remain aloof<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>and beyond as the gracious moon which shines down and illumines all things at night,<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>changing here, changing there with the hours, so that we shall not tire of it, but shall ever<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>be able to say, 4 10, the moon is at the full,' or, 4 behold, the new moon'. &amp; £/<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>And do not we mortals continually talk about this new moon? What a happy and delicious<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>mother*kindness is behind this idea of a beauty which rises in the skies and which continually<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>changes for her sons; continually soothes, continually passes, rises and then falls; charms,<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>is ever attracting; speaks in profound silences, whispers.... laughs.... is a girl.... is a wise<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>woman.... sleeps.... does this all for us, her sons, never changing in that.^<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>And some such raised thing, some such sweet influence, shedding down beams of assurance,<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>of calm, cold promise, that is what we want.

By the aid of the ground-plan it will be better<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>understood. Therefore study the ground-plan first and if there are some things which are<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>not quite clear in it, then it will be better to refer to the section. &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>I first begin with the foreground which shall be on a level with the eye, and which is flat,<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>and marked C. And from. B. to A. let the ground rise in the direction of A. The thicker of<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>the two upright pieces, that which is marked M., denotes the outside wall which is at the<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>extremity of the hall. The thinner upright piece marked P. denotes the extremity of the<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>stage; (1) the joint marked O. is the line of sight, and the joint where the line runs from<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>L. to O. and meets the upright piece P. becomes the line of sight, but which is to serve<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>only for that plane ; and this line will always be the line of sight for facades" of buildings<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>which face us: but those parts of buildings which are not facing will have their line of sight<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>marked O.: and it stands to reason that if the buildings show two fronts they shall have two<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>lines of sight: so much for the section of the scene.<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>We now proceed with the section of the auditorium. The Proscenium is marked D.; The<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>Orchestra which is marked E. is raised one half foot from the ground. F. indicates the seat<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>reserved for the nobility. The first steps which are marked G. are to be at the disposition<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>of the most noble ladies, and higher up the less noble shall be set. The broader steps<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>marked H. and I. are passages; between these two passages are the seats reserved for the<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>noble men. On the four steps above I. the middle class shall find place. That large space<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>marked K. shall be for the populace, and shall be lesser or greater in size according to the<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>size of the hall. The theatre and the scene that I made in were somewhat in the<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>manner I have described. From one end of the auditorium to the other it measured 80 feet;<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>and it was erected in a great courtyard where 1 found more room for it than for the stage,<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>this latter being built against a loggia. The construction and joints of the wood-work were<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>in the manner I have shown in the previous chapter, and since this theatre was without<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>any extra support whatever, for its greater strength I made it a Scarpa.<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>THE STAGE &lt;£? Few things may be contemplated with greater pleasure to the eye or more<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>rest to the spirit than the unveiling to our view of a stage setting. By means of the art of<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>perspective one receives an impression of superb palaces, vast temples and other splendid<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>buildings, and near and far spacious piazzas ornamented by various lofty turrets; long streets<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>crossed by other streets - triumphal arches - pyramids - obelisques, - and a thousand other<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>beautiful forms ornamented by innumerable lights of different strengths - large, medium,<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>small, in proportion, which are at times so cunningly arranged that they seem like so many<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>sparkling diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and other &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00046"/>Here one sees the horned and lucent moon rising slowly so slowly that the eye of the<lb facs="P18_TL00047"/>spectator does not see her move; in other scenes the rising of the sun is represented with<lb facs="P18_TL00048"/>such art that one remains lost in wonder. By like means one is enabled to see the descent<lb facs="P18_TL00049"/>of a God from on high, or the passage of some planet through the air. We may also see upon<lb facs="P18_TL00050"/>the stage various intermedii beautifully decorated, and figures strangely and fantastically</ab>

The<lb facs="P20_TL00014"/>Comic Scene, for representing Comedies: the Tragic Scene, for the Tragedies: and the Scena<lb facs="P20_TL00015"/>Satyrica for the Satires. &amp; JZ/ &lt;£? &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00016"/>The first, the Comic Scene, shall represent the exterior of the dwellings of private persons<lb facs="P20_TL00017"/>such as citizens, lawyers, merchants, parasites and other like men.<lb facs="P20_TL00018"/>The house of the Procuress must not be lacking nor must the Scene be without a tavern.<lb facs="P20_TL00019"/>A Church is also very necessary. The method for setting these buildings in position 1 have<lb facs="P20_TL00020"/>already given: " si nel levare i casameti sopra li piani, come nella pfanta delle scene massime,<lb facs="P20_TL00021"/>come &amp; done si dee porre 1' Orizonte. Nientedimeno accio che I'huomo sia meglio instrutto<lb facs="P20_TL00022"/>circa alle forme dei casamenti: io ne dimostro qui a lato una figura la quale potra, essere<lb facs="P20_TL00023"/>un poco di luce a chi di fa! cosa uorra dillettarsi. Pur in quesia essendo cosi piccola non<lb facs="P20_TL00024"/>ho potuto osseruare tutte le misure.

Those houses too,<lb facs="P20_TL00031"/>which have a heavily projecting upper story are of great use: you may see one in the Hostelry<lb facs="P20_TL00032"/>of the Moon in the accompanying engraving. One must take especial care to remember to<lb facs="P20_TL00033"/>place the smaller houses in the foreground, in order that the others which are behind<lb facs="P20_TL00034"/>may be visible, as, for instance, the house of the Procuress, (Rufiana) whose sign, the three</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P21_TL00007"/>Hooks, may be seen in the illustration " onde per tal superiority della casa piu a dietro, uiene<lb facs="P21_TL00008"/>a rappresentar grandezza, &amp; riempisse meglio la parte della scena, che non farebbe diminuendo<lb facs="P21_TL00009"/>se le summita delle case diminuissero Tuna dopo I'altra. £?<lb facs="P21_TL00010"/>And although the things here designed have their shadows painted on one side, still they<lb facs="P21_TL00011"/>show to better advantage when they are illuminated from the middle of the stage: therefore<lb facs="P21_TL00012"/>let the strongest Sights hang high up above the centre of the stage. The circular or square<lb facs="P21_TL00013"/>panes shown in the windows are transparent and of various colours, and the means for<lb facs="P21_TL00014"/>illuminating these I will give at the end of this book. &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00015"/>It will be well to put lights behind the windows which are facing, whether they be of glass,<lb facs="P21_TL00016"/>of paper or of painted linen. But were I to give you all the hints I could about these things<lb facs="P21_TL00017"/>I should be held to be tedious. Therefore I will leave them for the invention of those who<lb facs="P21_TL00018"/>wish to exercise their intelligence. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00019"/>THE TRAGIC SCENE &amp; The Tragic Scene will be for the representation of the Tragedies.<lb facs="P21_TL00020"/>The Buildings which we shall show must be only those inhabited by Great Persons. For the<lb facs="P21_TL00021"/>amorous adventures, strange intrigues and violent and cruel deaths such as those we read<lb facs="P21_TL00022"/>of in ancient and modern tragedies, have always befallen in those places where Dukes and<lb facs="P21_TL00023"/>Princes dwell and even in the Palaces of Kings. Therefore we must not in such scenes present<lb facs="P21_TL00024"/>buildings which have not nobility in them, but shall proceed as I have done in the following<lb facs="P21_TL00025"/>design, tho' alas! being so limited for space I have not been able to show on it all those great<lb facs="P21_TL00026"/>and royal edifices which it were more possible for me to present with greater space at my<lb facs="P21_TL00027"/>disposal. But it will be enough if the architect who has the handling of these matters shall<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>have a glimmering of what I mean. He will then know how to adapt himself according to the<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>place and the subject. It is the same here as in the Comic Scene. In this scene it will also<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>be best to put a small building in front of a large one for the reason I have already given.<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>My scenes have been made on frames and therefore it is very necessary to avail oneself of<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>the support of wood reliefs for the sake of strength for instance in that building on the<lb facs="P21_TL00033"/>right side of the design where the pilasters rest on a solid base, through which some steps<lb facs="P21_TL00034"/>pass. In this case the base must be solidly built, and upon the floor of this base the two<lb facs="P21_TL00035"/>frames can be placed, the one facing the audience and the other in receding perspective.<lb facs="P21_TL00036"/>These frames will extend to the summit of the parapet (to the point A.) The upper part of the<lb facs="P21_TL00037"/>house which rests upon these arches recedes slightly and will be made in like manner to<lb facs="P21_TL00038"/>that on which it rests. What I say of this particular building at the right of the design</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P22_TL00006"/>is to be applied also to the other buildings when the upper part recedes, especially of those<lb facs="P22_TL00007"/>buildings which are in the foreground. When such a building is placed far back at a greater<lb facs="P22_TL00008"/>distance from the audience, one frame well drawn and painted will suffice. As regards the<lb facs="P22_TL00009"/>artificial lights, what we have said in the Comic Scene applies to this scene also. All<lb facs="P22_TL00010"/>superstructure such as chimneys, belfries and such like things, although I show none in the<lb facs="P22_TL00011"/>engraving, shall be designed on thin boards and cut in profile. They must be both drawn<lb facs="P22_TL00012"/>and coloured with skill and when you wish to make some imitation statues of marble or bronze<lb facs="P22_TL00013"/>you will use a thin board or even a thick cardboard cut in silhouette and shaded properly.<lb facs="P22_TL00014"/>When placing them in position you must be careful to affix them far enough from the spectators<lb facs="P22_TL00015"/>lest a side view be obtained. &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;?&lt;£/<lb facs="P22_TL00016"/>In these scenes, although at times some artists have painted certain figures representing living<lb facs="P22_TL00017"/>creatures, for example a woman in a balcony or seen within a half-open door, or have pictured<lb facs="P22_TL00018"/>some running animal, I do not counsel that these things be done because they have not actual<lb facs="P22_TL00019"/>movement and are yet an imitation of actual beings. On the other hand it would be quite<lb facs="P22_TL00020"/>appropriate to represent some sleeping figure or some dog or other animal asleep, for this<lb facs="P22_TL00021"/>state has no movement. I will speak again on this point at the end of this book and give<lb facs="P22_TL00022"/>some idea as to the making of these things. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00023"/>OF THE SATIRIC SCENE The Satiric Scene is that used for the representation of Satiric<lb facs="P22_TL00024"/>Plays in which all those who live licentiously and without regard are reproved. In the<lb facs="P22_TL00025"/>ancient satires vicious and ill-living men were almost named by the players, and one<lb facs="P22_TL00026"/>can believe and understand also that such licence could only be permitted if it came from<lb facs="P22_TL00027"/>the mouths of half-witted persons or ill-educated rustic*; and it is for this reason that Vitruvio,<lb facs="P22_TL00028"/>treating of this scene, wishes that it may be ornamented with trees, rocks, hills, mountains,<lb facs="P22_TL00029"/>herbs, flowers and fountains, and desires also that there may be some rustic huts shown;<lb facs="P22_TL00030"/>and this we have done. And because these performances for the most part take place in our<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>land during the winter when but few herbs or flowers are to be found, you will have to<lb facs="P22_TL00032"/>make such, artificially, with silk, and this you can do so well that they will be even more</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P23_TL00002"/>praised than those made by nature. Also as in the Comic and Tragic Scenes we imitated<lb facs="P23_TL00003"/>houses and other buildings by means of painting, so again in this scene we shall not do ill<lb facs="P23_TL00004"/>to imitate herbs and flowers by the same means. And the more costly these things shall be,<lb facs="P23_TL00005"/>by so much will they be the more effective, and, truly, should be, in the hands of rich and<lb facs="P23_TL00006"/>magnanimous lords who are the enemies of stinginess. This lavishness my eyes beheld in<lb facs="P23_TL00007"/>some scenes ordered from the architect Girolamo Genga by his patron Francesco Maria, Duke<lb facs="P23_TL00008"/>of Urbino; and I noted as great liberality in the Prince, as taste and skill in the architect.<lb facs="P23_TL00009"/>In no other example of the art have I seen so much beauty. Oh Immortal Gods! What<lb facs="P23_TL00010"/>exhilaration lay in the sight of so many beautiful trees and fruits, so many herbs and sweet<lb facs="P23_TL00011"/>flowers fashioned from the finest silk of various colours; the little cliffs and rocks richly<lb facs="P23_TL00012"/>covered with many sea shells of great beauty, with snails and other little animals, with<lb facs="P23_TL00013"/>branches of coral of many colours, with mother of pearl, with sea crabs and with so great<lb facs="P23_TL00014"/>a variety of beautiful things that to attempt to write of them here would take too <lb facs="P23_TL00015"/>Neither will I attempt to tell of the satyrs, the nymphs, the syrens, and other monsters<lb facs="P23_TL00016"/>which were made with so much skill and then fitted over the bodies of men and children<lb facs="P23_TL00017"/>according to their size, and these set walking or running according to the nature of the<lb facs="P23_TL00018"/>animal, which they performed to the very life. And were it not that I fear to be tedious I<lb facs="P23_TL00019"/>would tell of the superb costumes of certain shepherds made of rich cloth of gold and of<lb facs="P23_TL00020"/>silk, and lined with the choicest fur of wild animals. I would tell, also, of the fishermen<lb facs="P23_TL00021"/>whose vestments were not less rich than the others and whose nets were made of fine golden<lb facs="P23_TL00022"/>thread even as all their other implements were in like manner made of gold. I would tell<lb facs="P23_TL00023"/>of certain shepherdesses and nymphs whose robes were made regardless of cost, but I<lb facs="P23_TL00024"/>leave it to the intelligence of all skilful architects to do such things when they shall find<lb facs="P23_TL00025"/>such patrons who generously open their hands to them that they may execute that which<lb facs="P23_TL00026"/>they desire.<lb facs="P23_TL00027"/>OF THE ARTIFICIAL LIGHT FOR THE SCENE. In the treatise upon the Comic Scene I<lb facs="P23_TL00028"/>promised to explain later the means of producing artificial lights of various colours, and<lb facs="P23_TL00029"/>first I will tell of the colour blue, " II quale rappresenta il zafiro e anco assai pio bello ".<lb facs="P23_TL00030"/>Take a piece of sal ammoniac and have at hand a barber's basin or another vessel of brass<lb facs="P23_TL00031"/>and pour into it a very little water. Let this piece of salt be well ground in the basin until<lb facs="P23_TL00032"/>it be entirely dissolved, ever adding a little more water the while.<lb facs="P23_TL00033"/>If you would have more of such a dye and if you would have the tone more intense you must<lb facs="P23_TL00034"/>add more sal ammoniac. Now having mixed a basinful of this water, strain it through felt<lb facs="P23_TL00035"/>into another vessel and a most beautiful azure blue will be produced. Wishing to make it lighter,<lb facs="P23_TL00036"/>add more pure water: thus of the same colour you will be able to make as many shades,<lb facs="P23_TL00037"/>light or dark, as you may wish. And if out of this same sapphire-tinted water you should<lb facs="P23_TL00038"/>wish to produce the colour of the emerald, add some saffron, more or less, according as you<lb facs="P23_TL00039"/>shall desire it, darker or lighter. Of these things I give no proportions, but by experience<lb facs="P23_TL00040"/>you will learn to make all the various shades whether light or dark. &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00041"/>To produce the colour of the ruby, should you be in a place where rich=coloured red wines<lb facs="P23_TL00042"/>are made, by means of these you may produce this colour.<lb facs="P23_TL00043"/>And if you should have no wines, take some virgin wax and cut it in little pieces - place<lb facs="P23_TL00044"/>it, together with as much rock alum, in a cauldron of water let it boil skim it, and<lb facs="P23_TL00045"/>then strain it through felt. After this, if you wish for a lighter colour you must add pure<lb facs="P23_TL00046"/>water. If you wish to produce the exact colour of a Balas Ruby a mixture of white and red<lb facs="P23_TL00047"/>wine will give it to you. Thus white wines of lighter or deeper tone can be used to produce<lb facs="P23_TL00048"/>the colour of Topaz or Chrysophrase. "Ma (senza dubbio alcuno) I'acqua pura passata pel<lb facs="P23_TL00049"/>feltro, contra fara gli diamanti ". Moreover to project the lights it will be necessary to make<lb facs="P23_TL00050"/>use of some lenses, therefore some bottles must be made at the glass furnace in a special<lb facs="P23_TL00051"/>form, and these must be filled with water. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00052"/>These will be placed behind the scenes, and where the lamps are required a long board<lb facs="P23_TL00053"/>must be fixed in such a manner that it will divide these lamps. Underneath and at right<lb facs="P23_TL00054"/>angles, there will be another board to support the glass bottles containing the coloured water.<lb facs="P23_TL00055"/>The bottles shall be placed with the rounded parts fitted into these holes, and be sure to<lb facs="P23_TL00056"/>see that they be well fixed that thay may not fall with the romping of the Morris dancers.<lb facs="P23_TL00057"/>Behind each of the bottles its own lamp will be placed so that each light shall be of equal<lb facs="P23_TL00058"/>strength. That part of the bottle which faces the lamp shall be flat or convex the better<lb facs="P23_TL00059"/>to concentrate the light so that the colours shall be more brilliant. The same treatment<lb facs="P23_TL00060"/>shall be applied to the windows seen in receding perspective. &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00061"/>It is sometimes necessary that there be a very large and fierce light. To produce this, you<lb facs="P23_TL00062"/>must place a torch behind the bottles and behind the torch must be fixed a barber's basin<lb facs="P23_TL00063"/>furbished very bright, the reflection from which will cast certain gleams like the rays of<lb facs="P23_TL00064"/>the sun. And if some of these openings be square or diamond shaped, you had best take<lb facs="P23_TL00065"/>some panes of glass of various colours and place them in position with a light behind them.<lb facs="P23_TL00066"/>But these lights will not be the sole illumination, for a large candelabra will hang in front of<lb facs="P23_TL00067"/>the stage. Suspended above this candelabra let there be a great vase full of distilled water<lb facs="P23_TL00068"/>wherein a piece of camphor shall be dropt and set on fire. This floating light makes a beautiful<lb facs="P23_TL00069"/>effect and creates a sweet aroma. When it is needful to represent some burning thing, you</ab>

And although<lb facs="P24_TL00004"/>regarding the lights one might say far, far more, this shall be sufficient for the moment.<lb facs="P24_TL00005"/>Let us touch upon a few more things which are of great delight to the spectators. To fill<lb facs="P24_TL00006"/>in that time when the actors are not upon the scene, the Architect will have prepared some<lb facs="P24_TL00007"/>processions of small figures, of a size proportionate to the arches through which they pass;<lb facs="P24_TL00008"/>these figures will be made of thick cardboard and cut in profile and may be painted. They<lb facs="P24_TL00009"/>will be fixed to a strip of wood which shall be made to run in a groove or swallow-tail<lb facs="P24_TL00010"/>mortise, and this mortise may be placed across some archway. A workman standing behind<lb facs="P24_TL00011"/>this arch can manipulate these figures so as to make them appear to move past the spectators.<lb facs="P24_TL00012"/>Let these figures sometimes be made to represent musicians playing upon instruments, and<lb facs="P24_TL00013"/>others singing with their throats: to assist this illusion let there be gentle music played<lb facs="P24_TL00014"/>behind the scenes. Besides this you can fashion groups or crowds, some on foot and some<lb facs="P24_TL00015"/>on horseback, and as they pass let some voices be raised in imitation of murmurs, and let<lb facs="P24_TL00016"/>there be a faint clamour of drums and blare of trumpets, for these things ever charm the<lb facs="P24_TL00017"/>spectators.<lb facs="P24_TL00018"/>If a planet or some other heavenly body is to be seen passing in its course through the air,<lb facs="P24_TL00019"/>let the same be well painted on cardboard, and cut in silhouette. Then stretch some fine<lb facs="P24_TL00020"/>wires from one side of the stage to the other at the furthest extremity from the spectators,<lb facs="P24_TL00021"/>and on the said wire let the painted cardboard be attached by small rings, and besides this<lb facs="P24_TL00022"/>a fine black thread is to be attached to the cardboard and the thread held by a workman who<lb facs="P24_TL00023"/>will draw the cardboard very slowly towards him. But all this must be very distant from<lb facs="P24_TL00024"/>the spectator in order that neither the wire nor the thread may be seen. jg&gt;<lb facs="P24_TL00025"/>Peals of thunder, and flashes of lightning and also thunder-bolts may sometimes be required;<lb facs="P24_TL00026"/>so you will produce the thunder as follows.<lb facs="P24_TL00027"/>The stage being that part of the theatre which is always erected at the end of a hall, above<lb facs="P24_TL00028"/>which there is always a floor, you will but have to roll a large stone ball upon this floor.<lb facs="P24_TL00029"/>You will imitate lightning as follows: a workman will be placed in a high position behind<lb facs="P24_TL00030"/>the scenes, holding in his hand a little box containing resin. The lid of the box shall be<lb facs="P24_TL00031"/>pierced by many holes and in the centre of the lid shall be a lighted taper, so that by jerking<lb facs="P24_TL00032"/>the hand which holds the box the powder will fly up and take fire when it comes in contact<lb facs="P24_TL00033"/>with the lighted taper. As for the thunder-bolts, let a wire be stretched at the back of the<lb facs="P24_TL00034"/>stage from above, on which a rocket or squib, adorned with sparkling gold, shall run. While<lb facs="P24_TL00035"/>the thunder is rumbling and towards the end of the peal, let the fuse be ignited which will<lb facs="P24_TL00036"/>set fire to the squib and produce a good effect. &amp; 44 Ma s'io volessi trattare di quante cose<lb facs="P24_TL00037"/>simili mi abbondano, io saria troppo lungo, peri) faccio fine quanto alia perspettiva ".</ab>

                                       <lb facs="P24_TL00049"/>This is a book which contains, as well as much that is of universal interest, certain passages<lb facs="P24_TL00050"/>which have a peculiar interest and importance from especial points of view. Of these we<lb facs="P24_TL00051"/>can but briefly notice two: first, Ibsen's dislike of seeing his dramas acted, and second,<lb facs="P24_TL00052"/>the financial difficulties which beset him throughout almost his whole life. &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00053"/>Referring to his shrinking from witnessing the representation of his own pieces Mr Macfall<lb facs="P24_TL00054"/>writes, " He detested to see his own plays on the stage. The actors came between him and<lb facs="P24_TL00055"/>his conception of the characters, often distorting them for ever ". And how could this be<lb facs="P24_TL00056"/>otherwise? For, from the moment when the last word was written, and the play, going forth<lb facs="P24_TL00057"/>to the world, left the poet 4 Lonely, as though he had been robbed of intimate friends ',<lb facs="P24_TL00058"/>it was complete, perfectly rounded as a work of art. Further addition was more than<lb facs="P24_TL00059"/>superfluous, it was encumbering; in that it blurred the conception of the author and confused<lb facs="P24_TL00060"/>the minds of those to whom he spoke, since for one actor who could interpret so subtle<lb facs="P24_TL00061"/>and elusive a thing as the spirit of a play, five hundred would only obtrude their own<lb facs="P24_TL00062"/>personality as a barrier between the audience and the poet. &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00063"/>This significant fact about Ibsen suggests the question whether this is not a matter upon<lb facs="P24_TL00064"/>which many poets and playwrights, could their real feeling be ascertained, would agree<lb facs="P24_TL00065"/>with him, thereby confirming the theory, from the point of view of the literary men themselves,<lb facs="P24_TL00066"/>that the Art of Literature has nothing to do with the Art of the Theatre; that any invasion<lb facs="P24_TL00067"/>by one of the territory of the other only ends in the mutilation, if not destruction, of<lb facs="P24_TL00068"/>them both.<lb facs="P24_TL00069"/>The other point to which we would draw attention is important as relating to a fact which<lb facs="P24_TL00070"/>we are too apt only to associate with the great artists long dead who have become romantic<lb facs="P24_TL00071"/>figures of the imagination, or with young artists, struggling and starving at the outset<lb facs="P24_TL00072"/>of a career; that is to say, Ibsen's financial position.</ab>

He who was in our midst onJy yesterday; the great Ibsen, Ibsen, whose name <lb facs="P25_TL00003"/>princes and nobles felt it to be an honour to mention—this great spirit, the bearer of this<lb facs="P25_TL00004"/>great name, had hardly enough money to pay for the barest necessities, and is obliged to<lb facs="P25_TL00005"/>address 4 a humble petition' to the king of his country three times before he can obtain the<lb facs="P25_TL00006"/>grant of L. 90 which should set him free for a few months from the vexations of the butcher,<lb facs="P25_TL00007"/>the baker and candlestick maker to study literature and art. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P25_TL00008"/>4 His lack of money' we read, 4 was terrible '. 4 He had to fall back on money lenders of the<lb facs="P25_TL00009"/>vilest kind'; and learning this of a great man who was with us but yesterday suggests at<lb facs="P25_TL00010"/>once the idea, is it possible that the great of today are in the same position? That the great<lb facs="P25_TL00011"/>sculptor has not sufficient money to buy his marble, that Ibsen's successor and the young<lb facs="P25_TL00012"/>Russian and others whose words or works go out across the world are fretted and hindered<lb facs="P25_TL00013"/>by the same paltry and ignoble cares?<lb facs="P25_TL00014"/>And if this be so in the present. and Judging from the case of Ibsen we may believe that<lb facs="P25_TL00015"/>it is so frequently,— is it ever to be so in the future? Is the artist, the freest sou! on earth,<lb facs="P25_TL00016"/>to be perpetually bound in that most sordid of prisons, poverty? to be forced to come down<lb facs="P25_TL00017"/>from communing with the gods to pacify the duns on his doorstep? to turn himself from his<lb facs="P25_TL00018"/>beautiful task to struggle for bare existence, and at last, perhaps, to lose heart under what<lb facs="P25_TL00019"/>Vasari describes as 44 the necessity of fighting against famine rather than for fame " ?<lb facs="P25_TL00020"/>It is a significant fact that the Jewish church in olden days made provision for its priesthood,<lb facs="P25_TL00021"/>that it might, without distraction by worldly cares, perform the temple service, and that<lb facs="P25_TL00022"/>this was, and is customary with almost all religious cults. &amp;<lb facs="P25_TL00023"/>This being so, when shall we in this Twentieth century, instead of stoning or starving the priests<lb facs="P25_TL00024"/>of our Art, be wise enough to set them free by some adequate and organised system from crippling<lb facs="P25_TL00025"/>anxieties about daily bread or weekly rent, so that, issuing from a place of silence and calm<lb facs="P25_TL00026"/>which are the conditions of revelation, they may show to the people that which they have seen?</ab>

Smith, Eider &amp; Co. igof).<lb facs="P25_TL00029"/>A volume of thoughtful and original studies, written with a good deal of charm and distinction<lb facs="P25_TL00030"/>of style is the 44 Papers of a Pariah ", to which Mr Benson has acted as literary sponser.<lb facs="P25_TL00031"/>In an introductory chapter Mr Benson gives us some outline of the character and condition<lb facs="P25_TL00032"/>of the writer, an actor, who, deeply attracted by the ritual, the symbolism and romance<lb facs="P25_TL00033"/>of the Roman Church (into which, just before his death, he was received), by the dignity<lb facs="P25_TL00034"/>of its ceremonies, its poignant silences, its profound mysteries, its rigorously proscribed<lb facs="P25_TL00035"/>movements and gestures, made these his study not merely from a spiritual or dogmatic point<lb facs="P25_TL00036"/>of view but aesthetically; and witnesses to the close alliance in ancient times between the<lb facs="P25_TL00037"/>Theatre and the religious cult; to the days when, indeed* they were not two but one.<lb facs="P25_TL00038"/>In such a point of view there is nothing new to those who have studied the history of the<lb facs="P25_TL00039"/>Theatre and know something of its origin, rooted deep in the religions of all lands; but<lb facs="P25_TL00040"/>certain details of the subject have been seldom better dealt with than in this little book.<lb facs="P25_TL00041"/>One of the most interesting and suggestive chapters is that which, entitled 44 The Religious<lb facs="P25_TL00042"/>Dance traces the survival of this in the Roman ceremonial of the Mass.<lb facs="P25_TL00043"/>Such a connection may come as a surprise to many; and yet it is very beautiful, very logical,<lb facs="P25_TL00044"/>and if it is strange to us it is only because of the strange views we have come to hold as<lb facs="P25_TL00045"/>to the real position and significance of dancing, views based usually upon imperfect<lb facs="P25_TL00046"/>knowledge and false ideals. We too often slur over, rather as a lapse of dignity, the fact<lb facs="P25_TL00047"/>that King David danced before the ark: we accord a kind of contemptuous pity to the dances<lb facs="P25_TL00048"/>of Fijians and Hottentots before their idols: we read, a little doubtfully, George Meredith's<lb facs="P25_TL00049"/>44 Jump-to-Glory-Jane"; and all the time it would never occur to us that some survival of<lb facs="P25_TL00050"/>the fervour and emotion which seek and find expression in beautiful and rythmic movement<lb facs="P25_TL00051"/>yet exist within the Roman Catholic Church. A dance in a Christian Church! The idea is at<lb facs="P25_TL00052"/>once repudiated as unseemly; and yet read the words of this writer: —44 It was during<lb facs="P25_TL00053"/>High Mass, not in France but in England, that the thought first came into my mind that<lb facs="P25_TL00054"/>perhaps here was a survival of the ancient religious dance; that stately, magnificent series<lb facs="P25_TL00055"/>of slow movements which surely may express devotion of the most solemn and reverent kind,<lb facs="P25_TL00056"/>as well as can the colour of vestment or sanctuary or the sounds of melody." 44 Observe "<lb facs="P25_TL00057"/>he goes on, 44 with me the motions of those three men in green at the foot of that lighted<lb facs="P25_TL00058"/>fragrant altar, and see how orderly and exquisite is the whole affair. It is no less than a<lb facs="P25_TL00059"/>sacred dance, and there is hardly one religious emotion that does not find its representative<lb facs="P25_TL00060"/>there.<lb facs="P25_TL00061"/>The passage which follows is of especial interest and significance, so emphatically does it<lb facs="P25_TL00062"/>enforce the necessity for the suppression of individual personality in any work of art or<lb facs="P25_TL00063"/>act of worship, recalling the days when not the persons of men but the symbols of Man were<lb facs="P25_TL00064"/>used in all religious rites. &amp;<lb facs="P25_TL00065"/>44 The actors in this drama, let us say a father and his two sons, are so swathed as to present<lb facs="P25_TL00066"/>the least possible resemblance to men. Their humanity, their corporal defects or advantages,<lb facs="P25_TL00067"/>the lines of their bodies, even their passions, their stupidities, all are obliterated as far<lb facs="P25_TL00068"/>as possible beneath the stiff folds of an antique dress; for they are not there as the Rev.</ab>

JZ? &amp;<lb facs="P26_TL00005"/>So, step by step, the writer follows every movement and gesture, describes every figure of<lb facs="P26_TL00006"/>the dance, every beautiful symbolic detail, until all is fulfilled; and then, " Even to me,<lb facs="P26_TL00007"/>Protestant as I am, it did seem completely suitable that an event so stupendous could scarcely<lb facs="P26_TL00008"/>be approached by any other process than that of a sacred dramatic dance, with an accompaniment<lb facs="P26_TL00009"/>of rigid and minute Court etiquette" human outlines must be obliterated by some<lb facs="P26_TL00010"/>overpowering uniform, personal tastes and methods of behaving must be rigidly supplanted<lb facs="P26_TL00011"/>by set movements and gestures for 44 Originality in the sanctuary, as has been well observed,<lb facs="P26_TL00012"/>is the greatest vulgarity known to men. " And may not much of what has been here said<lb facs="P26_TL00013"/>of the sanctuary hold good upon the stage? a&amp;</ab>

The motto<lb facs="P27_TL00020"/>of our journal is not, however, that of any<lb facs="P27_TL00021"/>of these. With them the Theory is first; is,<lb facs="P27_TL00022"/>indeed, everything: with us it follows upon<lb facs="P27_TL00023"/>the Practise. Let us explain what we mean.<lb facs="P27_TL00024"/>We take it that their papers contain merely<lb facs="P27_TL00025"/>a record of what is being done; and in speaking<lb facs="P27_TL00026"/>thus we do not for a moment undervalue or<lb facs="P27_TL00027"/>doubt the usefulness of these journals. On<lb facs="P27_TL00028"/>their own lines they serve many excellent<lb facs="P27_TL00029"/>purposes, mainly professional; while at times,<lb facs="P27_TL00030"/>as in the 4 Schaubuhne' and the 4 Art du<lb facs="P27_TL00031"/>Theatre', other, and more progressive matters,<lb facs="P27_TL00032"/>are gone into very seriously. But the value of<lb facs="P27_TL00033"/>a journal should not end there. It, like all<lb facs="P27_TL00034"/>other things, reflects the idea or the personality<lb facs="P27_TL00035"/>behind it, and, if we may be critical to our<lb facs="P27_TL00036"/>contemporaries, all the weakness of these<lb facs="P27_TL00037"/>theatrical journals lies in the fact that nine<lb facs="P27_TL00038"/>times out of ten their guiding spirit is a<lb facs="P27_TL00039"/>gentleman without any practical experience of<lb facs="P27_TL00040"/>the ropes of a theatre, and with but little<lb facs="P27_TL00041"/>knowledge of that far more vital and important<lb facs="P27_TL00042"/>thing,... the Art of the Theatre. Lacking both<lb facs="P27_TL00043"/>knowledge and convictions; knowing little<lb facs="P27_TL00044"/>of the vessel they are guiding and without<lb facs="P27_TL00045"/>any fixed idea as to the port toward which<lb facs="P27_TL00046"/>they steer, such men keep no direct course,<lb facs="P27_TL00047"/>but hesitatingly tack from side to side.

The result of this is obvious.

Therefore a journal, if its record of<lb facs="P27_TL00064"/>the past, its annunciation of the future, are to<lb facs="P27_TL00065"/>foe of value, needs an experienced leader, and<lb facs="P27_TL00066"/>this we have found in Mr Gordon Craig, who,<lb facs="P27_TL00067"/>not only with his pen and pencil but with, his<lb facs="P27_TL00068"/>advice, will guide the fortunes of this magazine.<lb facs="P27_TL00069"/>His guidance wiil foe valuable in that he has<lb facs="P27_TL00070"/>himself practised what we shall preach, and<lb facs="P27_TL00071"/>we, preaching what he has practised and what<lb facs="P27_TL00072"/>others may add to that practise, shall by so<lb facs="P27_TL00073"/>doing attempt to show where lies the future<lb facs="P27_TL00074"/>of the Theatre. Moreover, in securing Mr<lb facs="P27_TL00075"/>Craig's guidance we may claim to have secured<lb facs="P27_TL00076"/>that of the head of a movement which has<lb facs="P27_TL00077"/>actually taken place, which is spreading far<lb facs="P27_TL00078"/>and wide in the European Theatre, and of<lb facs="P27_TL00079"/>which the Theory now needs to foe definitely<lb facs="P27_TL00080"/>and clearly stated so that convictions may foe<lb facs="P27_TL00081"/>strengthened, scattered forces united, and<lb facs="P27_TL00082"/>all move forward with stability and unity of<lb facs="P27_TL00083"/>purpose towards one object, the re=<lb facs="P27_TL00084"/>establishment in its original dignity of a<lb facs="P27_TL00085"/>beautiful and ancient Art. &amp;<lb facs="P27_TL00086"/>Extract from letter from Mr: H.

And so<lb facs="P28_TL00038"/>he marshalled his army of words all of them<lb facs="P28_TL00039"/>to assault the Theatre, stood in the midst<lb facs="P28_TL00040"/>and watched his veritable Thirty Years War,<lb facs="P28_TL00041"/>his battle of words against visions sacked<lb facs="P28_TL00042"/>the Theatre, razed it to the ground, and then,<lb facs="P28_TL00043"/>scanning the horizon, was surprised that the<lb facs="P28_TL00044"/>Theatre was no more to be seen.

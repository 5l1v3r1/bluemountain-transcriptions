                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>as Benvenuto Cellini, according to the modern poet, said to Michelangelo,<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>44 Michael, let us talk about art" so I to you, Mamma, let us discuss the theatre. "<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>You know how we always discuss the theatre; I, talking for about four hours at a stretch and<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>you saying; 44 Yes, my dear, I know, " and I, with forefinger uplifted saying, 44 Don't you<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>see, don't you see?" While I'm quite unconscious that, before I was, you saw. So let us<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>continue at a distance the 44 Don't you sees " and the 44 I knows ".<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>To begin with it is a particularly fine day here. 44 Here " is Italy, 44 here " is Florence, and<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>44 here " is the perfect hill on which San Miniato is built. Sun of optimism all over the place,<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>and in the middle of it your son and his optimism.<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>The Newspaper comes here every day. 1 continually read of your nightly conversion<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>of Captain Brassbound, and sometimes of Nance Oldfield. Do you remember the fearful<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>rapidity with which Nance Oldfield first leapt upon the Lyceum Stage? Was it three days<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>that the play was produced in or twelve? it was not much longer at any rate.<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>What an excellently bad actor I was! And what a dreadfully good actress you were!<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>How exceedingly difficult it is for young actors and actresses when playing with masters of the<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>art to do anything at all, unless the young actor or actress is a little bit brilliant, rather<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>stupid, and absolutely conceited. How difficult it is to do anything but sit down and look<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>on. One feels such a duffer. They must all feel duffers. The ease with which the great actor<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>passes from thought to thought with hardly a movement of a muscle; the control the great<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>actors have over their voice, so that they can say many things in one sentence; the way in<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>which they are able to pass from one side of the stage to the other without seeming<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>to have moved at all; all these things are amazing and confounding for the young actor,<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>making him impatient that he cannot do this or anything like this. ... And then, when the<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>son of his mother cannot do this .... 44 orror on 'orror's 'ed haccumulates" as the old<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>prompter used to say. &amp; And here's the funny thing, too, about it; that a most intellectual,<lb facs="P5_TL00039"/>a most ideal mind, if trained for thirty years, could not do it, could it?.... does it ? ....has<lb facs="P5_TL00040"/>it ever been known to ? JS?<lb facs="P5_TL00041"/>Can acting ever be taught? No; you've said so many hundreds of times. No, But though<lb facs="P5_TL00042"/>you are not so good a critic as your daughter, meine liebe Schwester Edy, who is a superb<lb facs="P5_TL00043"/>critic, you are quite right; you must be... Don't you mean that you cannot teach acting<lb facs="P5_TL00044"/>in the same way as you can teach Algebra and Euclid, and also that you cannot teach<lb facs="P5_TL00045"/>acting as you can teach the rules of proportion or as you can teach counterpoint? &amp; These<lb facs="P5_TL00046"/>things have laws which hold good for all artists, architects and musicians; and by following<lb facs="P5_TL00047"/>which a decently musical or artistic soul can create beautiful harmonies, pictures or buildings,<lb facs="P5_TL00048"/>but by disregarding which can be created hideous confusion.... 44 I know, my dear, I know";</ab>

Acting cannot be taught. And as it cannot<lb facs="P6_TL00007"/>be taught, acting will ever remain one of those beautiful chance products, which seldom<lb facs="P6_TL00008"/>are seen in their full beauty. How many times in a century is it seen? Six or eight?<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>I dare say you in your generosity would say ten. And how many actors are there in the<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>world today? &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>I am writing a fearsome looking paper which commences " Acting is not an art. Actors are<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>not artists, " and the rest of it. &amp; Now that's a bright way to begin, but when you read it<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>yon will know what it all means. You will know that I am following up that which you<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>assert,... that acting cannot be taught, that it has no laws: that obviously, if this is true<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>it is no art. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>1 think if it had any laws you would have found them out long ago and would have told<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>me. Then what also supports what I advance is the fact that Madame Duse speaks in<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>something of the same strain, saying that until all the actors die of the plague the stage<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>will not be saved. &amp; As you know she goes on to say, " They poison the air, they make art<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>impossible;" and she probably includes herself, don't you think so, because she is not vain<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>or stupid. She probably means that to stop acting altogether, and for the theatre to be<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>thoroughly swept out, brushing aside all the plays, all the costumes and the rest of the<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>Lord Mayor's Show, would leave the place so blank and so fresh in its emptiness that when<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>the people of the theatre once more entered it they would enter in a different spirit, and<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>in royal trim; courage up, pride up, and purpose fixed; and with those qualities behind<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>them they would be capable of creating works of their own without assistance of the<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>playwright, of the costumier or of the orchestra. 1 think that is her opinion. The staff<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>on which her flag waves has no end. The flag can go up and up without reaching the top.<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>I believe that the great actors possess the power of creating pieces of work without<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>assistance of any one else; that is to say, 1 believe that you, or one of the few others,<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>could, taking some theme or some two themes, ... let us say the idea of Meeting and the<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>idea of Parting out of these things, by movement, scene, and voice, put before<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>the audience all the different meaning of all the joys and sorrows that are wrapped up<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>in the idea of Meeting and the idea of Parting. Especially could a woman do this, <lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>Let us, as it were, now make such a piece. We search in our imagination or our memory,<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>or wherever it is to be found, for the vision of those particular places where meeting smust<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>have happened. We gather them all together, ten, twenty, forty, a hundred. Some we throw<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>away for some reason or another as valueless. Those which we have retained, those which<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>we have selected, we put down, either in our memory if we are clever enough, or on paper,<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>or better still with a few touches of the pencil on paper. Those which we have selected<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>mean so much to us that when they are set before an audience, in the right way, they will<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>mean as much to them. They cannot fail to do so. &amp;So far so good. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>&amp; We next picture to ourself, or call up from our remembrance, from the thousand<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>and one sources.... books, pictures, and what we wi11,... those exquisite and appealing<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>movements which conveyed the thought, which created those moments... or those<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>movements which anticipated a meeting, and which lay in the very meeting itself. &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>We recall to mind, or appealing to our imagination, we beseech it to remind us of all those<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>sounds which are connected with this theme. Not merely sounds of the voice, but those<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>sounds innumerable by which even a blind man can tell what is happening and what has<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>happened and what is about to happen, as clearly as if he could see it. &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>Having got together this material, these three separate collections, as it were, of things done,<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>things seen, things heard, (and even while we were collecting them, we have been particular<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>to put aside and commingle only those which were of the same family), we can say we have<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>gathered together so many " Harmonies " in movement, scene, and voice on this theme.<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>We know that no artist will express these in the same way, and in the expression is the<lb facs="P6_TL00056"/>indefinable quality which here cannot be talked about. One will make his movements<lb facs="P6_TL00057"/>symbolical, another will make them realistic. One will make his scenes a vision, retaining<lb facs="P6_TL00058"/>only the very essence of the ideas which he has gathered together; another will make his<lb facs="P6_TL00059"/>a realistic scene. One will utter sounds musical in their quality, and will convey a sense,<lb facs="P6_TL00060"/>a hint of the thing; another will state facts, using matter-of-fact words; and in either case</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00002"/>success can be attained, although the finer success conies with the imaginative treatment.<lb facs="P7_TL00003"/>Let us take a meeting; one special one that I can think of. JS? Do you remembet the<lb facs="P7_TL00004"/>etching of Blind Tobit by Rembrandt? Get it and look at it now. x? &amp; The picture<lb facs="P7_TL00005"/>represents him in the moment when he hears the voice outside the door, and rising, hurries<lb facs="P7_TL00006"/>across the room, his face glowing, his body trembling. The old man makes for his own<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>shadow, which grows larger and larger on the wall as he advances. He has missed the door<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>entirely. We see in the picture how in rising he has overturned a spinning wheel. We see<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>a little dog, unconscious of his blindness, is running between his legs. Yet on he goes,<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>hopelessly, towards his own shadow.... (a very dramatic invention), and soon the expected<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>one will arrive. JZ? &amp; &amp; JZ? &amp; jg? &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>What we do not see in the picture but what we can imagine from it, is that beautiful yet<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>restless state of waiting previous to this meeting; and we can imagine the beautiful patience<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>which such a figure would convey to an audience, as silently in his room he waits for the<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>appointed time of his delivery. &amp; 1 can imagine the many little noises in the room, the<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>larger noises outside, and from the multitudinous examples which nature has to offer, we can<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>select a dozen, or two dozens at the most, of the significant scunds which will emphasize<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>either the patience, the anxiety, thev restlessness, the fear, or the love of old Tobit for the<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>one who is coming. &amp; I can hear him as he sits there waiting*, an old Jewish book of the<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>law on his knees, which he holds as a young woman holds a buich of flowers....; I can hear<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>him repeating in a deep soft voice law after law, and then bursting forth with the familiar<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>words of his prayer for extermination. &amp; I find in these wordf; sufficient use of the voice<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>and sufficient suggestion by words for my purpose. &amp; Soon tie voice of the one who is<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>coming, will be heard far off. We know what the tones mean without hearing a word. It<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>is the old love cry of " I am here ", and his cry which answers is but the same response<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>" Here am I". &amp; jg? &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>And so with the hundreds of actual meetings which are recorded in history; and so with t le<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>abstract ideas of Meeting and Parting You, and the other great workers in the theatie,<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>could present such to the audience. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>We have talked about this, I think, but not so much in detail as now; and 1 think you have<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>agreed, when the question has come up, as to what the gain would be. We have found<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>the gain to be a certain spontaneity, in as much as the performer was not hampered in his<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>expression by having to fit himself to the shape and size of the dramatist. &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>I was speaking to somebody about this the other day, when they asked me did I mean Dumb<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>Show. &lt;£?

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00005"/>r|phe early days of Rome are known to us only in the form of legends, tales, or stories, and<lb facs="P8_TL00006"/>not as history or contemporary record. The legend most favoured by the Romans tells<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>us that the town was founded by Romulus or Romus, a descendant of the Trojan hero<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>Aineias, the mythic son of Aphrodite, who is supposed to have escaped from Troy, and after<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>sundry flirtations with winds and waves in the Mediterranean, and with ladies on the coast<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>of Africa, found rest at last in the Italian peninsula. After this Romulus reigned certain<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>kings of whom stories are told as mythical as those concerning 44 the founder. " But out<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>of the legend we gather here and there fragments which are capable of being pieced together<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>into something like a probable entity. Thus, close by the Latin city of Rome, the Mons<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>Palatums, were certain Sabine and Etruscan settlements: one of these, the Sabine town<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>of the Quirites, called Curium, stood on the hills to the north, or the Mons Quirinalis and<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>the Capitolinus. These two towns appear to have early made a league, but Instead of<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>remaining two cities or forming one people, they assumed the position of two distinct peoples,<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>yet free citizens of the one city of Rome. The early kings were not hereditary, but were<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>elected alternately from the Romans and the Quirites. We have the names of seven of<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>these monarchs. The fifth and seventh were Etruscans from Tarquinii, and the last, Lucius<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>Tarquinius Superbus, described as cruel and lawless, was deposed and banished B. C. 510.<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>The acts of this king, of his son Sextus in the case of his cousin's wife—to which Shakspere<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>devotes his longest poem— and the ill odour which appears to have enveloped the whole<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>family, were too much for the Romans, and so they determined to have 110 more kings,<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>and entrusted the Government to two leaders, afterwards called Praetors, and later still<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>Consuls. Under the kings the people had been divided into the two classes of Patrician<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>and Plebeian. When the monarchy came to an end, the leaders and magistrate of Rome<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>were elected from the Patricians by the whole body of the people; but after a little while<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>the Plebeians rose against the idea of the Patricians enjoying special privileges, and, after<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>much stormy disputing, the Plebeians gradually gained the day, and at last, in B. C. '366,<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>they elected one of themselves to be Consul. Now the story of Coriolanus comes to us as<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>a legend, and long before the time of authentic history. It belongs to the period of the<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>Commonwealth, and is therefore subsequent to B. C. 510. But it must also be subsequent<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>to B. C. 494, for in that year the Plebeians, impoverished by war and smarting under oppression,<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>retired to the Mons Sacer, three miles from Rome, and could not be induced to return<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>until the right of appointing tribunes was conceded them. At first the number of the<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>tribunes was limited to two. but in B. C. 457 the number was Increased to ten, and our<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>play presents us with five, so that the story must fall between the years 494*457* But the<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>text says Coriolanus was sixteen years old when Tarqum besieged Rome. If this refers to<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>the story of the last attack Coriolanus must have been born B.C. 514; he would consequently<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>have been twenty years old when the first Plebeian Tribunes were appointed in 494.<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>And now what sort of towns were Rome and Corioli in those early days—the days of Darius<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>King of Persia? We can have very little hesitation in replying that Rome, like Corioli, was<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>essentially Etruscan. The later or Etruscan kings had done much to improve Rome by the<lb facs="P8_TL00045"/>erection of new buildings and a general encouragement of their native arts. So, therefore,</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00002"/>it is to Etruria and her Asiatic birthplace we must turn if we wish to get an idea of Rome<lb facs="P9_TL00003"/>before its destruction by the Gauls (B. C. 390). &amp; jg? &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00004"/>Of Etruscan buildings very little now remains; amphitheatres, theatres, city walls and tombs<lb facs="P9_TL00005"/>may be seen, but no temples, palaces, or dwelling houses. At Tusculum and Arpino pointed<lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>arches with horizontal joints occur very similar to the early Greek work at Thoricus and<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>Mycena?. Sutri still possesses its amphitheatre, cut, as so many of the tombs are, out of<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>the solid rock. But in none of these works is there the slightest indication of anything<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>approaching elaboration, and if any " order " existed it was most likely to have been some<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>simple form of the lonic, or in other words one founded on Asiatic traditions. We have<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>the arch proper (of radiating construction) in Assyria—in the drain beneath the south-east<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>palace at Nimroud—we find it in Etruria and in the Etruscan work of the Cloaca Maxima,<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>built during the Roman monarchy. We have in Greece—at Thoricus and Mycenae—the pointed<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>arch built in horizontal courses, and we find it again in Etruria,—at Caere, Arpino, and<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>Tusculum, whilst at Assos in Asia Minor the pointed and the semicircular arch occur in the<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>same gateway one behind the other. The natural inference of this is that the early architecture<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>of Rome was that of Etruria, and that the architecture of Etruria, like its people, descended<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>through the Pelasgic from the Asiatic race. The bracket capital, of which the lonic was the<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>final outcome, may therefore be taken as the index of the style. The temples and palaces<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>were no doubt small, and in great part constructed of wood, the material so much favoured<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>in Assyria and Syria. The ordinary houses would scarcely be of more durable material, but<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>the town walls, gateways, and tombs were evidently of stone strongly and carefully knit<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>together. Vitruvius says the Etruscans had two kinds of plans for temples, one circular like<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>their tumuli, and one rectangular, arranged with three cella?. Both, however, were compara=<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>tively small, in fact, building appears to have flourished in this confederacy more under the<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>engineer than under the architect: for even the tombs at Caste! d'Asso show nothing more than<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>sloping walls, sloping door jambs, and extremely broad mouldings relieved by small members,<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>the section of which is unlike anything we know as Greek or Roman. But on the other hand,<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>Coriolanus tells us (Act iii., Sc. 3) that his Rome had " large temples and that the seaport<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>town of Antium was a " goodly city " of " fair edifices. " Turning now to the scenery as<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>set down in the play, we find no less than twenty-eight scenes, twenty of which are<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>architectural. These twenty are divided between the cities of Rome, Corioli, and Antium.<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>In Rome we have—<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>1. A street. (Act i. Sc, 1, which may be made to serve for the public place in Act ii.<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>Sc. 1; Act iv. Sc. 6; Act v: Sc. 1 and 4; as also for the street scenes, Act iii. Sc. 1;<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>and Act iv. Sc. 2.)<lb facs="P9_TL00037"/>2. An apartment in Marcius's house. (Act i. Sc. 3, which may also do duty for Act iii. Sc. 2.)<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>3. The Capitol. (Act ii. Sc. 2.)<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>4. The market-place. (Act ii. Sc. 3, and Act iii. Sc. 3.)<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>5. Before a gate of the city. (Act iv. Sc. 1.)<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>Here the most important architectural scene is that numbered 3, which, under the word<lb facs="P9_TL00042"/>" Capitol, " introduces us to the interior of the temple of Jupiter, designed under Tarquinius<lb facs="P9_TL00043"/>Priscus, finished during the reign of the last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, and dedicated<lb facs="P9_TL00044"/>in the third year of the Commonwealth or Republic, B.C. 507. Nothing whatever now<lb facs="P9_TL00045"/>remains of this Etruscan work. All we know is that it had three cellse side by side under<lb facs="P9_TL00046"/>the same roof: the central one, larger than the others, was dedicated to Jupiter, that on<lb facs="P9_TL00047"/>the left to Juno, and that 011 the right to Minerva. Of the other scenes I have only to say<lb facs="P9_TL00048"/>that the character of the buildings would partake very much of that already described in<lb facs="P9_TL00049"/>my first article on the Greek plays (1). The walls of the city and<lb facs="P9_TL00050"/>the lower storeys of the better class of houses would be built of large blocks of stone,<lb facs="P9_TL00051"/>squared in courses or polygonal. Going round the city we should see arched or semi-circular<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00052"/>headed gateways, square flanking turrets or towers, and embattled walls. Within the houses,<lb facs="P9_TL00053"/>courts, with small rooms surrounding them, might be seen, and where upper storeys occur,<lb facs="P9_TL00054"/>colonnades might be introduced on the top of th£ ground-floor walls, the whole covered<lb facs="P9_TL00055"/>either with flat or pointed roofs. In the best of the Patrician houses we should find two<lb facs="P9_TL00056"/>such courts, the outer one for the men, and the inner one for the women, and it would be</ab>

The houses of the<lb facs="P10_TL00007"/>Patricians would be of stogie, terra cotta and wood, the tenements of the Plebeians would<lb facs="P10_TL00008"/>be mere hovels, chiefly composed of wood, mud, and thatch. &amp; jgr<lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>Turning now to Corioli the architectural scenery consists of<lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>1. The senate-house (interior, Act i. Sc. 2).<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>2. Before the walls (Act i. Sc. 4 and 7).<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>3. Within the town.<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>The walls, gateways, and streets would be much the same as in Rome, and the Senate<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>House might be constructed on the theatre plan—a semicircle with raised seats, perhaps<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>cut out of the solid rock, and covered with a velarium. Passing on to Antium we have<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>1. An open place before the house of Aufidius (Act iv. Sc. 4).<lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>2. A hall in the same I ouse (Act iv. Sc. 5).<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>3. A public place (Act v. Sc. 5, may very well be the same as No. 1).<lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>Here we have only to deal with the house of the " General of the Volsces, " and taking<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>into consideration the words of Coriolanus in the opening speech of the fourth Act, we may<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>not be wrong in assuming this house to be the most palatial-looking residence of the three<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>towns illustrated in the scrnery of this play. The exterior would probably be little different<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>from those already desci ibed in my third article on the Greek plays. The interior<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>is here clearly the atrium or area; the roof might have been supported by square or round<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>pillars, but possibly only by four cross beams. Whichever way we take it the scene can<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>hardly fail to be impressive if properly carried out. The dark, muffled, meanly-clothed figure<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>of Coriolanus, the busy servants, the chaplet-crowned gay Aufidius, the bright painted walls,<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>the terra-cotta figures and ornaments, the fountain, the shadowy recesses, the soft notes of<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>the flute, and the murmur of the wine drinkers (for dinner is just over, the tables have<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>*<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>been changed, and the ser&gt; ants are fetching the wine), are ingredients for a picture, on<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>stage or canvas, which could scarcely fail to command the attention of multitudes—that is<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>if the lime-light did not exist. So long, however, as theatres are what they are, it is sincerely<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>to be hoped no one will be quite fool enough to attempt to put this play upon the stage.<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>The scenery is extremely difficult to arrange, the costume as yet hardly understood even by<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>the best antiquaries, and al ove all there is no actor living who can act, speak or even look<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>the part of the hero of this tragedy, and certainly no actress physically or mentally capable<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>of impersonating Volumnia. Modern actors and actresses have no conception of the drama<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>directly it becomes poetry. The dignity and beauty of art are old-fashioned things, quite<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>out of keeping with the modern spirit that delights in chaff and mockery, and fondly<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>believes them to be the outcome of wit. To mock at love, religion, education; to jeer the<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>unfortunate; to chaff the suicide; and ridicule the justice and majesty of the law are the<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>things which succeed if done with a sufficient amount of absurdity, and 1 may add accompanied<lb facs="P10_TL00044"/>by a sufficient number of 1 retty girls and pretty songs. This mockery is unquestionably<lb facs="P10_TL00045"/>the central spirit of the age, and those who take it and mould it for the stage into an hour's<lb facs="P10_TL00046"/>amusement for us are the artists who, perhaps, best represent, and who will be most<lb facs="P10_TL00047"/>identified with, the age. Of Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Sullivan we ought only to speak in words<lb facs="P10_TL00048"/>of praise: their work within the limits assigned is wholly admirable and altogether to be<lb facs="P10_TL00049"/>preferred to the dull commonplaces or the smart impertinences of modern English " comedy."<lb facs="P10_TL00050"/>But of the people who, having become tired with burlesque of classic myth, and, bored with<lb facs="P10_TL00051"/>stagy reflections of their own vapid lives, now prefer to see the passions of their own lives<lb facs="P10_TL00052"/>burlesqued rather than demand Che poetical drama, and by the demand cause the supply of<lb facs="P10_TL00053"/>the poetical or artistic actor—of these people one might fairly hold opinion with Pythagoras,<lb facs="P10_TL00054"/>that souls of animals infuse themselves into the trunks of men. &amp;<lb facs="P10_TL00055"/>Having delivered one more word against that detestable pretence, the modern stage, 1<lb facs="P10_TL00056"/>would say a few words on the cortume of the people and time to which the play refers. And<lb facs="P10_TL00057"/>first we must remember that in costume as in architecture the Roman style, as we generally<lb facs="P10_TL00058"/>understand the expression, had no existence—had not, in fact, come into being at the period<lb facs="P10_TL00059"/>above fixed as that wherein we must seek the action, viz., B. C. 494*457. Etruria is the<lb facs="P10_TL00060"/>first country to which we ought t&gt; look, and it is fortunate that we possess in the British<lb facs="P10_TL00061"/>Museum a singularly interesting Etruscan monument that contains in the modelling of its<lb facs="P10_TL00062"/>burnt clay almost all the information we can need for completing the mise-eii-scene of<lb facs="P10_TL00063"/>Coriolanus. The visitor to the Museum, having passed along the Roman gallery, finds himself</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P11_TL00006"/>at the upper audi of the Great Egyptian room or gallery: here in a central position, cutting<lb facs="P11_TL00007"/>off, so to speak, the end of the large room, so that it appears as a cross gallery in continuation<lb facs="P11_TL00008"/>of and uniting the Roman and the Graeco-Roman rooms, is the terra-cotta Etruscan<lb facs="P11_TL00009"/>monument to which I have referred. This large and valuable relic belongs to the Castellani<lb facs="P11_TL00010"/>Collection, and was found at Cerventri, the modern title of the old Etruscan city of Caere—a<lb facs="P11_TL00011"/>city of great antiquity and territorial importance and in such close connection with Rome<lb facs="P11_TL00012"/>that she received the vestal virgins when the Gauls cried havoc and ldt slip their dogs of<lb facs="P11_TL00013"/>war upon the banks of Tiber. Now let any one examine well the figures in the single combat<lb facs="P11_TL00014"/>represented In the bas-relief on the front of the monument, and then go to the first vase<lb facs="P11_TL00015"/>room and look at the figures of Hector and Menelaus fighting over the body of Euphorbos<lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>on the Greek pinax or plate in the table case, at the upper end of the room, or if he inspects<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>the bas-relief with Mr. Thompson's admirable photograph of the plnax in his hand, he cannot<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>fail to recognise an extraordinary similitude between the Etruscan model and the Greek<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>painting, which Dr. Birch dates about B. C. 600. If, again, we compare the civil costume<lb facs="P11_TL00020"/>represented on the Caere Monument with those exhibited on the Assyrian slabs and the<lb facs="P11_TL00021"/>fragments in the table cases, we cannot long hesitate in arriving at the conclusion that the<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>men of Corioli and the inhabitants of Rome and Antium before the Gaulish invasion still<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>obeyed in externals at least the Asiatic influence of tradition. Compared with the Greek<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>and later Roman costume, the dresses of the figures before us show a marked scantiness<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>of material. The women's dress consists of a tunic reaching to just above the ankle, cut<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>square, looped with two or three buttons, making it high in the neck, and producing shoulder<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>sleeves. This tunic is secured by a very broad waist or breast-belt, and over the shoulders<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>and arms a capacious shawl is worn, which is evidently used as the outdoor garment and<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>ordinary covering for the head. The hair is dressed in more than one fashion, but a caul<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>confining the back hair and a fillet round the front hair, with short curls over the forehead<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>is the fashion most affected, although the hair on the principal figure is worn in long tight<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>braids. One lady has her back hair divided into three portions, the central portion being<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>by far the largest, and these are confined within a triple or three-lobed caul, one division<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>falling over the back and one behind each ear, an arrangement which appears to me a decided<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>improvement on the single caul. Besides military and civil costume, these bas-reliefs furnish<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>us with illustrations of furniture, so that we need not trouble to search much further for<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>evidence wherewith to complete the mise-enscene of this play of Coriolanus. <lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>The text Is singularly free from anachronisms, and the poet follows the story as told by<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>Plutarch with an accuracy which neither fetters the poet nor detracts from the poetry,<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>and which adds the charm of a strong and vivid reality to every person and every scene.<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>The references to such things as coals, mailed hands, drums, steel pikes, pack-saddles,<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>mummers, spectacles, gloves, handkerchiefs, groats, churchyards, &amp;c., and the introduction<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>of the names Hob and Dick, (1) are made in the slightest manner, and are entirely out-weighed<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>by the references to customs and things of the date of the story. With regard to architecture<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>and furniture we have reference made to embroidered hangings, in Volumnia's first speech<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>to cushions and to stalls, bulks, windows, lead-flats, ridged roofs, and temples that could<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>be burnt "in their cement." Little mention is made of costume and implements,<lb facs="P11_TL00048"/>but we hear of bats and clubs, of cobbled shoes, doublets, leaden spoons, caps, pins, veils,<lb facs="P11_TL00049"/>scarfs, targets, or circular shields and buckled helms.</ab>

" &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>&amp; The writer in The Stage goes on to accuse The Mask of not acting like The Stage would<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>have acted. He says it is a pity that The Mask did not define what is meant by Realism:<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>in other words, he hints that The Stage would have consulted the experts and would have<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>prefaced their opinions by giving its own. This is what the writer in The Stage says:<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>44 It seems a pity that The Mask did not define what it meant by realism. Apparently<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>44 it takes realism and reality to be one and the same. It would perhaps be better to regard<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>44 realistic treatment as that treatment which favours a close approximation to the real. "<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>We think that the experts have really described Realism better than the writer in The Stage,<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>much as we would like to look upon this writer in the London theatrical journal as an<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>expert.<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>The writer then goes on to say that The Mask dissembled. He continues, 44 Why did<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>44 the Mask dissemble thus? Here is Mr Beerbohm Tree saying 'Obviously' to No. 2, and<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>44 4To all ' to No. 3. " In other words, he implies that Mr Beerbohm Tree is careless and that<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>he is off=»hand. The questions were very plain to understand, as readers of The Mask will<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>remember. To the first, 44 Do you consider Realism in acting to be a frank representation<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>of human nature? " Mr Tree replies 44 Obviously ".... and obviously that is just what realism is,<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>for the experts admit as much. Before replying the experts had time to consider what a<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>frank representation of a character might degenerate to 44 if the actor should be allowed the<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>same liberty as is permitted to the writer or the painter. " And then we asked, 44 Should<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>this liberty be allowed? " the two questions forming one. Mr Tree replied (i) 44 Obviously "<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>and (2) 44 Why not?" Mr Grundy replied (1) 44 Yes ", (2) 44 Most certainly not." Mr Gordon<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>Craig replied, (1) 44 Yes ", and (2) 44 The actor will never ask for this liberty. "<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>*£? Now, all these gentlemen are supposed to know how much liberty is allowed to the<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>writer and the painter,.... not merely to the old writers and painters, but to the modern<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>writers and painters. With them it is perrnissable to paint and write of subjects which it<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>is obviously {surely obviously) impossible for the actor to represent without being pelted<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>with eggs and onions.<lb facs="P12_TL00043"/>Mr Tree asks why he and his fellows shall not be allowed to represent in a frank way<lb facs="P12_TL00044"/>and with the same liberty as the writer and painter, the episodes of Samson and Delilah,<lb facs="P12_TL00045"/>Perseus and Andromeda, The Annunciation, Judith and Holofernes and others which The<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>Stage,.... the very organ of the foot lights, says are 44 too startling to mention with a<lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>respectable Lord Chamberlain about." &lt;£? JZJ<lb facs="P12_TL00048"/>Now, how would it be possible to do this? Surely, as Mr Grundy points out, the actor<lb facs="P12_TL00049"/>being flesh and blood makes this impossible. Why? We want to know why. On what grounds?<lb facs="P12_TL00050"/>esthetic or moral? We think the reply would be Both. It would be really ridiculous to see<lb facs="P12_TL00051"/>the Perseus which the most realistic painters and sculptors have shown us is the Perseus<lb facs="P12_TL00052"/>for the eye, the real Perseus, and therefore the Perseus for the Realists, walking about on<lb facs="P12_TL00053"/>the stage of His Majesty's Theatre with a pair of sandals on, a helmet, and very little else.<lb facs="P12_TL00054"/>And it is because it would be ridiculous that it would be immoral. Surely Mr Tree would<lb facs="P12_TL00055"/>be the first to say this if he has not said it already.<lb facs="P12_TL00056"/>JS? But no, strangely enough we turn to his answer and we find that he sees no reason<lb facs="P12_TL00057"/>why he or any other actor should not give a frank representation of Perseus. He may</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P13_TL00005"/>advance that he would represent Perseus in a different way, than, for instance, Benvenuto<lb facs="P13_TL00006"/>Cellini; that he would cover him in a toga or in any case in a short skirt with fleshings.<lb facs="P13_TL00007"/>But if so the thing becomes doubly ridiculous. Perhaps Mr Tree would advance that ridicule<lb facs="P13_TL00008"/>is the best weapon to employ against a monster. But to he ridiculous? Surely<lb facs="P13_TL00009"/>no hero was ever ridiculous except in Mr Shaw's mockeries? Mr Tree may say, "Why<lb facs="P13_TL00010"/>should I go out of my way to enact Perseus? 1 never suggested I should enact Perseus.<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>You asked me whether I wished for the same liberty in my expression of the passions as<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>that permitted to the writer or the painter. " Well then, we reply, if Perseus does not<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>suit you, let us take some other instance where the role is agreable to you. Let us take<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>Adam for example. There is hardly a great poet or a great painter who has not depicted<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>incidents from the life of Adam and Eve, and those painters and poets who have excelled most<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>have treated the subject in the most austere manner possible. &amp; jg? &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>Now let us agree with Mr Tree that it would be possible for him to treat the subject<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>in an austere manner. It is not necessary for him to represent every incident in the life<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>of Adam. Here he has a wide area and can choose what incidents he wishes, but he must<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>admit that unless the passions represented here are primitive ones he would most certainly<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>fail in his representation. And if you clothe Adam and Eve you again become ridiculous.<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>Milton does not clothe Adam and Eve, neither does Kranach clothe Adam and Eve. The<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>painter who represented Adam and Eve in costume would be ridiculous. &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>&amp; Of course Mr Tree may say that he would take an incident after the Fall: that he would<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>assume hunting costume, forest=like in character and that on the rise of the curtain Eve<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>would be discovered making a pair of little pantaloons for Cain. But the first glimpse that<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>I<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>the pit had of a jacket or a pair of breeches would be enough to settle the fortunes of<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>the play, and Mr Tree knows this. Then what does he mean b}' asking why the actor should<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>not be allowed the same liberty of expression as that permitted to the writer and the<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>painter ?<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>What we want to draw attention to is a very important fact. It is the difference<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>between the stage and the fine arts. And our purpose in doing so is to uphold the opinion<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>expressed by Mr Craig that acting is not an art and the actor not an artist; not because<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>he is a whit less intelligent than other men, but because the nature of his work does not<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>permit us to regard it as a fine art.<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>The arts have won the liberty to express what they wish. The writer and the painter<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>have from the earliest time had full liberty. The musician, owing to the mystery of his<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>medium, has even a fuller liberty. Beethoven, Wagner and the other masters of music<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>express certain things in their music by which, if the public saw them in actuality on the<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>stage, it would be outraged, for the public is not always able to accept the truth of beauty<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>through the channels of its understanding. It is impossible for the public to understand<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>the simplicity of great truth, and so this mystical medium of the musician appeals merely<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>to its senses. No one can say what the musician means though many understand what he<lb facs="P13_TL00045"/>hints at, and as there is no statement made the communication is a private one. It is not<lb facs="P13_TL00046"/>quite the same with the writer and the painter, and the communion between actor and<lb facs="P13_TL00047"/>audience is entirely a pubiic thing. &amp; 1 jz? &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00048"/>Again, we may hear the music of the musician without seeing the musician himself. <lb facs="P13_TL00049"/>We can see the painting of the painter without seeing him and we can read the words of<lb facs="P13_TL00050"/>the poet without seeing him. Therefore when Milton begins<lb facs="P13_TL00051"/>" Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee<lb facs="P13_TL00052"/>Jest and youthful jollity<lb facs="P13_TL00053"/>we do not feel we are going to be put to the inconvenience of having to witness a nymph<lb facs="P13_TL00054"/>clad as Milton describes her going through the pantomime of the poetry: no, thank<lb facs="P13_TL00055"/>heaven, not even when the poetry of pantomime will have been restored. &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00056"/>When we go to the Academy, and a Royal Academician, following the tradition of his<lb facs="P13_TL00057"/>predecessors, is permitted to paint for us a " Venus at the Bath " we are quite certain that<lb facs="P13_TL00058"/>we shall not run the risk of the figure beginning to move and later on of being obliged<lb facs="P13_TL00059"/>to be introduced to her at the Duke of Mac Butland's. But think of the tedious bore it<lb facs="P13_TL00060"/>would be if we were to go to the theatre to witness Miss Melpomene Smith's undraped<lb facs="P13_TL00061"/>representation of Andromeda chained to the rock, if we knew that we should meet the lady the</ab>

Again, if you meet them off the<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>stage why go to see them on the stage?

Theophrastus would persuade us that, according to your system, we not only<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>should decline the succour of the wretched, but avoid the sympathies that poets and historians<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>would awaken in us. Probably for the sake of introducing some idle verses, written by a<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>friend of his, he says that, following the guidance of Epicurus, we should altogether shun<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>the theatre; and not only when Prometheus and Gsdipus and Philoetetes are introduced,<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>but even when generous and kindly sentiments are predominant, if they partake of that<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>tenderness which belongs to pity &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; <lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>&amp; &amp; Epicurus! although it would be very interesting, no doubt, to hear more of<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>what you do after dinner—(aside to him) now don't smile; 1 shall never forgive you if you<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>say a single word—yet 1 would rather hear a little about the theatre, and whether you<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>think at last that women should frequent it; for you have often said the contrary. &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>&amp; Epicurus. I think they should visit it rarely; not because it excites their affections, but<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>because it deadens them. To me nothing is so odious as to be at once among the rabble<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>and among the heroes, and, while I am receiving into my heart the most exquisite of<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>human sensations, to feel upon my shoulder the hand of some inattentive and insensible<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>young officer.<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>Eeontiou. Oh very bad indeed! horrible! Ternissei. You quite fire at the idea. &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>Eeontion. Not I: I don't care about it. Temissa. Not about what is very bad indeed?<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>quite horrible? Eeontion. I seldom go thither.<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>Epicurus. The theatre is delightful when we erect it in our own house or arbour, and<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>when there is but one spectator. &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>&amp; Eeoutiou. You must lose the illusion in great part, if you only read the tragedy, which<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>I fancy to be your meaning.<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>&amp; Epicurus. I lose the less of it. Do not imagine that the illusion is, or can be, or ought<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>to be, complete. If it were possible, no Phalaris or Perillus could devise a crueller torture.<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>Here are two imitations: first, the poet's of the sufferer; secondly, the* actor's of both; poetry<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>is superinduced. No man in pain ever uttered the better part of the language used by<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>Sophocles. We admit it, and willingly, and are at least as much illuded by it as by anything<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>else we hear or see upon the stage. Poets and statuaries and painters give us an adorned<lb facs="P14_TL00051"/>imitation of the object, so skilfully treated that we receive it for a correct one. This is<lb facs="P14_TL00052"/>the only illusion they aim at; this is the perfection of their arts. rz? jz?<lb facs="P14_TL00053"/>&amp; Eeoniion.

                                    <lb facs="P15_TL00004"/>the stream of waiters and the eaters, I feel conscious of the presence of a certain<lb facs="P15_TL00005"/>spirit of the Theatre. Here is no play certainly, no words: and no series of incidents, no<lb facs="P15_TL00006"/>development of any great character. Yet it is Drama. It is enough: there is an impression,<lb facs="P15_TL00007"/>and a strong one, created by these two ideas. The idea of the Eaters and their Feeding.<lb facs="P15_TL00008"/>The idea of the Servers and their Service. &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00009"/>Then comes on me the wish to attempt to transport on to the stage that which is before<lb facs="P15_TL00010"/>me. To do this 1 must give it a Form. Full of interest I start. &lt;&amp;?■ &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>I find the conventional forms are useless. No five act play is before me: no Tragedy,<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>no Comedy. A study; a sketch; an impression, a specimen. The Eaters and the Serving<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>Men. Strangest medley of manners at surface with undercurrents even stranger.<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>jZ&gt; How treat this impression of half an hour, how hint at the hidden by unveiling that<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>which may be seen<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>Two treatments; and the easiest occurs the quickest tome. The modern characterization<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>of the modern play. For the moment I see no other opening. The powerful picture of two<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>of the eaters, their amazingly entertaining actions, their particular little ways never alike<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>for an instant; the air of friendship which passes from one to the other and the more<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>certain undercurrent,—the sense of animosity. Two beings from different worlds, but<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>each a snob; both rich but common men, they seem to resemble two animals I have seen;<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>the long protracted dinner with its courses ever on the crescendo; the cackle of pompous<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>insipidity. &lt;6?<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>And then the more serious human element, the Waiters; the only workers in the room.<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>Each a personality, and a very marked one. jZ? jZ? jZ? z?<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>The first, who evidently owns a couple of horses in the country and possibly has his<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>own gardener who attends carefully to the peaches. The second, who might be the son of<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>some sea captain; with him is the sea's tinge of melancholy, but with all the airs of a<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>gentleman. One imagines him dressed In the uniform of a naval officer and somehow it<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>would suit him. A third would wear with a grace the army uniform, and judging by his<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>keen eye, his courteous manipulation of the guests and swift control over the hundred<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>hidden cooks, he must be a man of personal magnetism. jz&gt; AH of these men are distinguished.<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>Nearly all have the manners of gentlemen. jZ? jZ? &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>And to bring the whole impression on to the stage? Although the method of<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>characterization seemed at first the easiest one there now appear insurmountable barriers!<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>For we must consider our means, our material. jz/<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>If we are to show all this intricate work in detail, we need actors of personality to undertake<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>each role. We may draw twelve strongly defined characters and we shall look in vain for twelve<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>such actors of character in one theatre. We might find twelve such if we had thirty theatres to<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>pick from each one man. For the subtlety, the humour, the exceedingly delicate differences<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>and strangely interesting manner of each of the figures in this scene is extraordinary. And<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>not merely is it difficult for lack of actors, for Iti away actors would be wasted. Pantomimists,<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>that is to say, the actor at his best, would be of more use: but alas, few pantomimists exist.<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>And then, although it is the waiters who make the most impression on me as I sit here<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>watching them, when we come to transfer it to a platform or a canvass it is not necessarily<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>through these figures of the waiters that we shall produce the same impression as I am<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>now receiving. More likely will it be through something to do with line, colour, movement,<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>—things far removed from impersonation or representation; which have little to do with<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>the reproduction of actualities.<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>So that the treatment must be a fresh one. Characterization is of no use here. And not<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>for this reason alone—not merely for lack of actors. This Impression is not to be brought<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>before us on the stage by means of a Realistic treatment in which characterization plays<lb facs="P15_TL00053"/>the all important part, but by a Fantastic treatment, a sweeping glance, the impression<lb facs="P15_TL00054"/>seized en masse, the individuals merged in the Atmosphere or Tone. Then and then only<lb facs="P15_TL00055"/>is it possible to put on the stage this impression which is without a story and must remain<lb facs="P15_TL00056"/>also wthout characterization. &amp;</ab>

And this<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>suggestion is not to be produced by merely cutting down the present material used in the<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>theatre; is not to be shown by merely lowering the Sights upon the present material; is<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>not to be shown by manipulating with a little more reserve the material of the modern<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>theatre, but by choosing new materia! altogether. For the Art of the Theatre is after all<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>to reveal, to show by means of movement a Glimpse or a Vision of all things. And to this<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>Vision belongs Proportion far more than all ell else. We can no longer be put off with<lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>the modern makeshift. Man and the voice of man, that little personality and that little<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>voice, loom far too large in the modern theatre and throw all things out of proportion<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>destroying all harmony by their aggressiveness. And this single impression of the eaters and<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>the waiters is but one of many that the Theatre was born to convey; and it can convey such<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>impressions, be they either of eating, of travelling or of meditating, of common things or<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>of high things only by the second treatment I have spoken of, the imaginative and<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>impressionistic treatment. And great actors are not needed for such work. Their talent<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>or genius is in the development of character, and, as I have said, character has here<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>dwindled and we see fifteen figures who pass and repass, their acts and actions starting<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>a certain rhythm, conveying a certain sense; the other two figures who are seated by<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>their movements complete that rhythm. &amp; &amp; &lt;£&gt;<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>&amp; And why have I said nothing of words, for character, plot, story, is told by words<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>These indeed shall play their part in the general Impression, but their part is, as it were,<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>but to add touches of colour; they shall bring colour to the impression, If one may so<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>speak, a colour of sound, and not a noisy and vulgar exhibition of sound which on our<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>stages of today degenerates into chatter or shouting So that the words will not be to<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>explain, to make mathematically clear, to lay bare. Our Impression of these few moments<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>(like most of our impressions) is a strangely suggestive vision, all vague, yet clear enough<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>to those who have eyes and senses to understand: so clear that we who watch can supply<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>the words, the very thoughts of these figures who eat and who wait. Therefore in bringing<lb facs="P16_TL00038"/>our impressions to you we must leave it vague yet clear enough f0r....y0u. &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00039"/>And will not all this be very dull? you ask. &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00040"/>&amp; Indeed, the opposite of dull,—delightful. I have chosen the most ordinary Impression<lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>for my illustration and you will easily see how a far higher and more carefully selected<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>theme would respond to such a treatment. The higher we go the easier and the more<lb facs="P16_TL00043"/>delightful. A long sustained impression such as the great writers from to<lb facs="P16_TL00044"/>Maeterlinck give us, that 1 do not claim ; that is not in the nature of such visions, for what<lb facs="P16_TL00045"/>Foe tells us is true of poems, is doubly true of visions,—that there can be no such thing<lb facs="P16_TL00046"/>as a long one.

Much of my success I<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>owe to study of the elder Wallack and to<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>Rachel. Wallack showed me the necessity<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>of conveying at a rehearsal what you intend<lb facs="P17_TL00048"/>to do at night, and the importance of paying<lb facs="P17_TL00049"/>strict attention to the minutest detail.

Louis James may be a finer actor than Sothern, but that is not<lb facs="P17_TL00073"/>what I am concerned with here,.... and perhaps Mr Louis James' words have been incorrectly<lb facs="P17_TL00074"/>reported, though looking at the paragraph carefully this does not seem to be the case. So<lb facs="P17_TL00075"/>that if the actor has been correctly reported he makes himself out to be the most careless<lb facs="P17_TL00076"/>student of a play and the most amazing vandal who ever cut up a dramatic master piece.<lb facs="P17_TL00077"/>Perhaps it is one of the " rare careless James moments. " It certainly is not a serious<lb facs="P17_TL00078"/>moment. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00079"/>First of all, he does not see why " Peer Gynt" should be hard to understand. Then he<lb facs="P17_TL00080"/>explains why he does not find " Peer Gynt" hard to understand, and he gives Ibsen the<lb facs="P17_TL00081"/>credit of writing an ordinary everyday rollicking dare devil character, and he says that<lb facs="P17_TL00082"/>" Peer uvnt,, is not an unfamiliar role on the stage; and therefore being a not unfamiliar<lb facs="P17_TL00083"/>role he intends to cut the play down a third. You notice that he says there is a lot of<lb facs="P17_TL00084"/>this master piece by Ibsen which can be spared, and in spite of Ibsen telling us that the<lb facs="P17_TL00085"/>play has to be performed in thirty eight different scenes, Mr James intends to throw out<lb facs="P17_TL00086"/>of it a lot of scenes which mean nothing to him and some anticlimaxes which mean less<lb facs="P17_TL00087"/>than nothing to him.<lb facs="P17_TL00088"/>One would have thought that Ibsen, who wrote this play, would have known better<lb facs="P17_TL00089"/>than Mr James how many scenes were necessary and also something about the climax and<lb facs="P17_TL00090"/>anticlimax of the tragedy.

" &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00005"/>I think that any body reading this James paragraph must admit that it is about the funniest<lb facs="P18_TL00006"/>thing that ever has appeared in print about an actor. Here we have a man who may be, for all<lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>we know, a very fine actor; but who on the face of it turns his profession into a joke, tie<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>intends to cut down the play a third. Why, it is tremendous! He does not intend to cut<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>down Mr Claude Fitch's play, or one by Mr Stephen Phillips because Mr Phillips and Mr<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>Fitch are alive, and because they would tell him their reasons for the length of their plays:<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>but not having Ibsen at his elbow to tell him the simple yet profound reasons why this<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>play 44 Peer Oynt" is a certain length, why it is in thirty eight scenes and why there are<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>anti-climaxes and a climax, Mr James is unable to see himself in the role, and in his despair<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>he comes to the conclusion that what he cannot understand cannot be of any value <lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>and so he cuts it out.<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>What he can understand is that 44 Peer Ciynt" is an egoist, is a dare devil, a soldier of<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>fortune and an incurable liar because the man tells many lies during the play, (lies of an<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>enormously poetical character), because he wanders from land to land seeking his fortune,<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>because he experiences many daring adventures and because he is continually soliloquising<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>about himself. But any child can understand as much. Any member of the audience who<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>goes to the theatre can read as much from the book without going to see Mr James. What<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>the actor is for is to show us those things which we cannot see for ourselves: not to cut<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>out that third part of the play which puzzles us just because it puzzles him. And then on<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>the top of it all for Mr James to say " I don't know why Peer Gynt should be hard to<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>understand!!!..!!" Mr James seems to have found it so hard to understand that he throws up<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>the sponge.<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>Now, this is very typical of a certain kind of actor. This is a type which has probably<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>always existed, but he is a type which everybody should try to put out of existence. He<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>lowers the standard. He is the worst type. He is a far worse type than that which says<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>" I'm not acting for Art's sake. I am acting for my bread and butter. The only day which<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>interests me is Friday morning when I receive my salary. " This is a type easily to be<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>understood and which does no one harm but himself. JSZ &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>But Mr James stands for the type of actor who is serious, who undertakes to bring to<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>the nation the serious master pieces. There is no more serious work than " Peer Gynt „<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>in the whole range of the modern drama. Perhaps we may say that there never has been<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>a play so difficult to understand since the birth of dramatic literature; and therefore<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>those actors who undertake to represent such a play accept a very serious trust; they stand<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>for all that is highest in the intellect and the character of the stage. Therefore when such<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>an actor takes such a master piece and cuts it down a third, upsets the sequence of the<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>scenes, misunderstands the anti»climaxes and talks about Ibsen's passages as 44 spoiling the<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>44 effect " it lowers the standard of the type which he is there to uphold, and gives the<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>impression that the most intelligent type of actor is an out and out ignoramus. &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>Now turn to the paragraph where Sothern speaks. He is essentially the type of the<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>serious actor. He does not talk in a slap-dash manner about cutting master pieces: his<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>voice is very quiet and modest, and all young actors should follow what he says here. He is<lb facs="P18_TL00046"/>really typical of the fine serious actors. He gives up an engagement for six weeks to study<lb facs="P18_TL00047"/>Rachel. He understands how wonderful it is in her that she had less action than any other<lb facs="P18_TL00048"/>actress he had ever seen. He understands the grimness of her acting which he describes<lb facs="P18_TL00049"/>as being 44 almost painful. "He does not talk about 44 effect" but rather about 44 thoroughly<lb facs="P18_TL00050"/>understanding 44 Doing everything as well as he knows how 44 never acting on the<lb facs="P18_TL00051"/>impulse of the moment".... 44 paying strict attention to details ".... 44 being able to give a<lb facs="P18_TL00052"/>reason for everything he does".... &lt;4 if not able to find this reason, then not doing it." &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00053"/>JZ? Comparing the statements of James and Sothern we find that the first has a bad influence<lb facs="P18_TL00054"/>on the young actor while the second has a good influence. The first teaches the young<lb facs="P18_TL00055"/>actor to say 44 that which I cannot understand must be nonsense ". The second will teach<lb facs="P18_TL00056"/>him to go on working until he thoroughly understands the most difficult things. James<lb facs="P18_TL00057"/>would teach the young actor to avoid difficulties, Sothern to surmount them. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00058"/>&amp; James, therefore, would create the mentally flabby actor, Sothern would create the</ab>

" Plenty to do, Sir, " they<lb facs="P21_TL00026"/>answered, 44 to get ready in time; but it will<lb facs="P21_TL00027"/>be all right on the night ".

We are<lb facs="P22_TL00074"/>in a transition state, but there is plenty of<lb facs="P22_TL00075"/>movement, and movement means thought<lb facs="P22_TL00076"/>and thought progress.; The mere fact that<lb facs="P22_TL00077"/>the audience is one trained to an intellectual<lb facs="P22_TL00078"/>understanding of what is enrolled before<lb facs="P22_TL00079"/>them places the management on the qui vive.<lb facs="P22_TL00080"/>The managers know what is demanded of<lb facs="P22_TL00081"/>them and must do everything in their power<lb facs="P22_TL00082"/>to keep up a certain standard of excellence;<lb facs="P22_TL00083"/>therefore the performances as a rule show<lb facs="P22_TL00084"/>slow and painstaking execution. This is to<lb facs="P22_TL00085"/>be seen at all the theatres. The leading role<lb facs="P22_TL00086"/>is played by the Imperial Theatre. Here<lb facs="P22_TL00087"/>for ages the youth of Vienna have been<lb facs="P22_TL00088"/>educated in the classical drama and here<lb facs="P22_TL00089"/>the love of the Theatre is engendered,and<lb facs="P22_TL00090"/>what is more, classical nights always pay.<lb facs="P22_TL00091"/>Those who have not the wherewithal to<lb facs="P22_TL00092"/>purchase seats are content to stand for hours<lb facs="P22_TL00093"/>waiting for the opening of the doors for<lb facs="P22_TL00094"/>the chance of obtaining a standing place for<lb facs="P22_TL00095"/>the performance, and eveii the errand boys<lb facs="P22_TL00096"/>may be seen reading Reclame's editions of<lb facs="P22_TL00097"/>the classics, Schiller, Shakespeare, Grlllparzer,<lb facs="P22_TL00098"/>Goethe. This shows a deep-rooted inborn<lb facs="P22_TL00099"/>love for the drama which, tenderly fostered,<lb facs="P22_TL00100"/>expands and sends its branches everywhere.<lb facs="P22_TL00101"/>And thus critical audiences are trained. But<lb facs="P22_TL00102"/>the Imperial Theatre does not confine itself<lb facs="P22_TL00103"/>to the classics let it be said. Next to this<lb facs="P22_TL00104"/>conies the Deutches Volkstheater which is<lb facs="P22_TL00105"/>as a rule visited by the same critical audience<lb facs="P22_TL00106"/>as the Imperial Theatre, and where the same<lb facs="P22_TL00107"/>demands are made and responded to. These<lb facs="P22_TL00108"/>two form a class to themselves. &lt;£? &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00109"/>There is still another and a higher class,<lb facs="P22_TL00110"/>but by far in the minority, which demands<lb facs="P22_TL00111"/>more than these two theatres can offer, and<lb facs="P22_TL00112"/>therefore seldom visits them. These yearn for<lb facs="P22_TL00113"/>something higher than the usual performances<lb facs="P22_TL00114"/>both as regards the acting and the stage<lb facs="P22_TL00115"/>decorations. These look forward to a bright<lb facs="P22_TL00116"/>future, and Duse is their ideal. And she has<lb facs="P22_TL00117"/>sown good seeds here which time will surely<lb facs="P22_TL00118"/>fructify.<lb facs="P22_TL00119"/>Of the sections of the public who desire<lb facs="P22_TL00120"/>a mere nothing but a few hours amusement<lb facs="P22_TL00121"/>without any real intellectual enjoyment here<lb facs="P22_TL00122"/>is no place to speak. There are always such<lb facs="P22_TL00123"/>in all large cities as the numbers of theatres<lb facs="P22_TL00124"/>devoted to such entertainment can testify.<lb facs="P22_TL00125"/>But it must be maintained that even here<lb facs="P22_TL00126"/>the audience is a highly critical one.<lb facs="P22_TL00127"/>&amp; But the theatre forms but one half of the<lb facs="P22_TL00128"/>education of the Viennese. Music is as<lb facs="P22_TL00129"/>inborn to them as is the drama, and these<lb facs="P22_TL00130"/>twin sisters go hand in hand. Mahler has<lb facs="P22_TL00131"/>trained an audience, highly sensitive, cultured,<lb facs="P22_TL00132"/>and hence critical and drastic as lie was, it<lb facs="P22_TL00133"/>would be well would the theatre managers<lb facs="P22_TL00134"/>follow more in his wake.</ab>

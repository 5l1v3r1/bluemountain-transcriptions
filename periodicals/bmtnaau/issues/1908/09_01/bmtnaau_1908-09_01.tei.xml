To misunderstand is only deliberate carelessness.<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>&amp; A design for a stage scene should need no explanation:... but where is the harm in<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>trying to make a thing clearer by words when the design itself has failed ? &amp; The failure<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>is not mine: it is yours, and I don't for an instant believe you will understand it a scrap<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>better after you have read this note. But you will feel that something is wrong with you<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>and that is all I want you to feel.<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>To begin with, this is only a design for a scene and not the scene itself. The language<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>of a scene differs from a design on paper. 1 have translated the scene freely and not with<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>an exactness demanded by the Berlitz School. Look at it freely and without that brain<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>snobbery which deadens the gaiety of life and all will be well. Be content not to understand<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>it all at once and we shall be friends. But if you look at it through a film of quite<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>unnecessary bitterness awakened by the delusion that you are being fooled, then you will<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>be utterly nonplussed and the thing will make you furious or bitter or disdainful. &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>&amp; I would prevent this if possible. What is it ? Only what you like to make it. If you can't<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>hang a thought on it give it up. If you can it will perhaps repay you. Best if you find<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>it to be one of the following things. A scene expressing the idea of two forces, mobility<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>and immobility,... or.... it is a scene representing the city of Troy in flames,... or.... a scene<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>fram Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida in all its accuracy of detail, period B. C. II84»900.<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>The pillar in the foreground is one of the supports of the door of that period: that in the<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>middle distance another and in the background you can see the walls. Flames and smoke<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>complete the design. <lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>&amp; You may take your choice as to which of these three solutions you accept, but as I have<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>now given you a choice you can no longer accuse yourself of not being able to understand it.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00005"/>uddenly a hoarse roar of welcome bursts from the gloom<lb facs="P6_TL00006"/>beyond the orchestra, betraying the dim throng that sits<lb facs="P6_TL00007"/>densely packed in the dark hollow of the theatre of<lb facs="P6_TL00008"/>varieties, and there steps quickly before the footlights<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>with a pretty touch of the shoulders and smiling at the<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>clamour of their greeting,... Yvette Guilbert. As she<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>stands radiant there in white there enters almost stealthily<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>a young man in evening dress, a dandified fellow, his<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>hair brushed back from the cleanshaven face, his dress<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>of an early Victorian picturesqueness that proclaims the<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>French student of the artists' quarter, and seats himself<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>at the piano. &amp;</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P6_TB00006">
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>The thunder increases and {alls away; rises again; and again conies the gust of acclaim:<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>Yvette Guilbert! She bends her ringletted head of chesnut coloured hair, and bows in her<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>wide crinolined skirts of white silken fulness, sprigs of roses clustered upon them; and<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>smiles a strange smile in answer to the salutation of a hoarse-throated applause. A little<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>involuntarily the brows gather as though in nervous distress at the prolonged din. Her<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>hand, gloved only to the wrist of the white arm in the quaint habit of a bygone day, is<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>held out to hush the hails of the multitude. It creates stilly silence. Yvette Guilbert<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>announces " Les Cloches de Nantes ". &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>The voice has that husky note of the dramatic utterance.... they all have it, Ellen Terry,<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>Yvette Guilbert, Duse, all. The piano sends out a ripple of lightly struck chords upon the<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>expectant hush. And she, archly tossing her head, lilts the opening lines of the old<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>French ballad.<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>&amp; At once the actress is in possession of the house. Almost before the first note is fully<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>uttered, that dramatic voice and absolute gesture have gripped the heart; quickly the old<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>ballad comes back to life, fragrant with the aroma of ancient days. Romance has stepped<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>into this lime-lit place. The years roll back; and we are sighing with the jailor's<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>daughter where she gazes, her eyes tear-wet, upon the empty cell that she has helped to<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>make a part of the aching void in her heart.... nerves thrill, the lip quivers; there leaps<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>straight into our stilled imagination the haunting picture, and takes possession there. &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>In the prison of Nantes there is prisoner, a prisoner whom no one EVER goes to see<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>but the daughter of the turnkey. Ah! ah! ah! - Ah! ah! ah!.... Whom no one ever goes to<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>see but the daughter of the turnkey, she who takes hiin water to drink, water to drink,<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>and food to eat. Ah! ah! ah! - Ah! ah! ah!...."Ah me! since tomorrow I die, strike the fetters<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>from my feet. Strike - the fetters - from = my feet".... All the bells of Nantes got them<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>a-ringing: Ah! ah! ah! - Ah! ah! ah! All the bells of Nantes got them a-ringing.... The little<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>maid's a young thing.

The little maid's a<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>a young thing She frees his feet a-weeping ...She - frees = his feet - a=weeping.<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>Quick the prisoner with a bound leaps into the river. Hey! hey! hey!.... Hey! hey! hey! Leaps<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>into the river So here's to girls of Nantes! Likewise to all prisoners! Ho! ho! hey!....<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>Ha! ha! hah!<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>JZ&gt; Ay; in those all too few swift speeding minutes of song, by her magic, just standing<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>there in that quaint fantastic garb that in no slightest degree aids her in creating the<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>pictured thing, the art's skill of this wonderful woman has banished space and time and<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>the dark hushed world of eager faces in the surrounding gloom, and we are back to the<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>years and air and pathetic winsomeness of the old tragi-comedy. We leap into the tide<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>that flows by the walls of Nantes, and eagerly, as with the cramped limbs of the prisoner,<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>we are breasting that flow to the sea, and all the while, sounds the carillon of bells, that<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>peal above the town of Nantes, now sad, now triumphant, now eager, now sobbing, running<lb facs="P6_TL00056"/>like litany through all the vision, yet even as the youth stands free, drinking to the<lb facs="P6_TL00057"/>jailor's daughter, the carillon contracts one's heart, for there are tears in the eyes of the<lb facs="P6_TL00058"/>girl who bows her head in the empty cell..,, alone, &amp; *</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00002"/>&amp; This is supreme acting, the indescribable consummate compelling thing that no mortal<lb facs="P7_TL00003"/>can teach; that it is given only to genius to do. No rule nor plummet can measure it;<lb facs="P7_TL00004"/>no laws produce<lb facs="P7_TL00005"/>&amp; it has all been roused in us, this vision, so completely that one starts at the thunder<lb facs="P7_TL00006"/>of applause which leaps at the music's ending. Read the simple lines in cold blood; and<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>you wonder how, from such scant fabric she has woven so rich a tapestry. &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>Yvette stands smiling and bowing. &amp; This is no longer the slender Yvette of the<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>simple dress and the long black gloves who was the idol of the students of the Latin<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>Quarter « well - but a few years ago, when all's said. Those were the days of the craze<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>for the prison=songs, the devil=me=care lyric, up at Aristide Bruant's cafe, where mine host<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>with rough affectation of brutality and brusquery, accosted one in surly fashion at the<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>door, then leaping on to the table in his heavy long boots, sang the glories of prisons and<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>of jail=birds. You will say that the Yvette of the old French ballad has usurped the Yvette<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>of the older ruder fashions = No. The black cap of the ouvrier is on her head, a muffler<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>round her throat. A few sombre chords float out upon the smoke laden air; and, at a<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>stroke, we are back with Yvette of the old days.... for all the whimsical skirts of the<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>voluminous crinoline. The shoulders are up; the jaw thrust out; and the gutteral voice<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>of the hooligan lad of Montmartre, with its emphatic curtness of suggestion and intensity<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>of .utterance, sounds roughly across the footlights. &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>&amp; You lean forward, straining to interpret the jargon.... even a cultured Frenchman follows<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>the slang with difficulty. But Yvette's dramatic skill flashes the meaning across the<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>theatre, it is the very statement of the vile soul of the lad, the youth of the factory quarter<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>who knows no honest toil, who indeed schemes ever with the calculated industry of crime<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>to evade that toil.<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>Conceited in his blackuardisms, glorying in what manhood would hide as a thing of<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>shame, boasting of bleeding the girls of their money, proud of doing no honest thing in<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>his day, vaunting his coward kick that lays the constable low, arrogant in his lack of<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>friends, gloating in the hate of his fellow men and the fear of his fellow scoundrels, he<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>would have you know that he is no daylight lark, ho! ho! not he. He comes out at<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>nightfall, when the rich blokes are out strutting it in their silk hats and evening dress <lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>what? Some fool of them has strolled alone, Gawd help him! I&gt; 11 soon turn out the<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>swaggering fellow's pockets, and give him a fright, no fear! And if the fool shows fight,<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>down he '11 go ....what? He's hurt! Gawd!.... where can I put him.... Here! wake up!.... Holy<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>miracle! a constable! Here, get up you fool! wake up, d'ye hear. Caught! my Gawd!<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>What's this? the judge, and the condemned cell! Morning's near broke » what's that?<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>great God! the guillotine. They're saluting my head! " The foul braggart oath and the<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>bluster are done. The figure of the terrified lad crouches in terror, the hoarse gutteral<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>words hang in the air.... die out.<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>Again the shout leaps out of the pitchy blackness of the theatre; the black cap and the<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>scarf are whipped off and flung aside; Yvette stands up, the illusion vanishes, reluctantly<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>it goes, so complete has it been, holding one's senses as in a vice.<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>This I say is supreme acting. How those few rough lines have been made to tell the<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>whole ugly tragedy, to build up the distorted life !<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>&amp; Yvette Guilbert, her eyes sparkling mischief, her figure and demeanour all demure, is<lb facs="P7_TL00046"/>carolling in English, English with just that delightful childish trace of accent that makes<lb facs="P7_TL00047"/>our tongue, spoken by the French, the most fascinating of foreign translations, the simple<lb facs="P7_TL00048"/>humourous song of " Mary was a housmaid " or 6i I wonder when I shall be married, oh,<lb facs="P7_TL00049"/>be married ". And with what wealth of suggestion, with what whimsical humour and keen<lb facs="P7_TL00050"/>insight, she enriches the meaning of each slightest sylable, until the very hummed lines<lb facs="P7_TL00051"/>give out a dramatic meaning in their significant comedy.<lb facs="P7_TL00052"/>Equally at home in tragedy and comedy, in pathos and in humour, with a skill and style all her<lb facs="P7_TL00053"/>own is Yvette... the inimitable. Here is a profound actress. By some strange chance she has found<lb facs="P7_TL00054"/>in a few short lyrics a scope for her genius which yields her a larger field of drama than<lb facs="P7_TL00055"/>five acts can win for most full casts. Listen to quite a clever songstress sing the " Keys of<lb facs="P7_TL00056"/>Heaven"; then listen to Yvette Guilbert; and you shall realise the vast gulf that yawns<lb facs="P7_TL00057"/>between genius and talent.<lb facs="P7_TL00058"/>It is claimed for Yvette Guilbert that she has found in the old romantic French songs a</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00002"/>higher field for her artistry than was hers before; I cannot bow to this. I never saw her<lb facs="P8_TL00003"/>even in the very earliest days, but that she was a woman of genius. Whatsoever she touches<lb facs="P8_TL00004"/>she makes into a work of art. She is, within the limits imposed upon her by the music hall,<lb facs="P8_TL00005"/>as supreme a genius as ever stepped the stage. It cannot be otherwise, for it were impossible<lb facs="P8_TL00006"/>to state with more exquisite beauty and perfection and power the emotion that it is essayed<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>to arouse. The gamut of the emotions, (the sole instrument of any artist whatsoever) called<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>forth by her, ranges from sordid to sublime tragedy, from low to high comedy, from pathos to<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>quaint whimsicality, and she plays each part with unerring surety and finesse; above all<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>she convinces, for whilst she holds the stage we walk by way of her personality throughout<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>the experience of every emotion she would make us feel.<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>It is astounding what sense she wrings from every syllable, from every phrase, of the ballads<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>and songs she transmits into dramatic gems. Her pantomime, her inflection of voice, and<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>her employment of the utterances of the throat to express the passions and emotions that<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>may be conveyed by words, are a revelation of the power that lies within words. And it<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>is precisely in this achievement in this realm that an actor is a creative artist or merely<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>a clever and accomplished mimic.<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>Success did not rush scrambling with smirk and smile of welcome, tripping in very eagerness<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>over the ribbons of monstrous posies of flowers, to hail the first coming of Yvette Guilbert.<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>She had to battle her way. First came the humiliations that go with hanging about the<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>doors of managers, the aching anxieties that their evasive nod or blunt disapproval meant<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>to a young woman with a gaunt figure, and the awkward carriage of the body that had still<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>much of the gauche slenderness of a girl who has sprung up to womanhood too quickly.<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>Such was Yvette, when all is said. She had, frank truth to tell, not the airs and graces and<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>finished tricks of manner that go to make the battery to win success of the leading ladies of<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>the national theatre. The accent held the slurred drawl that mars for French ears the<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>speech of the industrial faubourgs. And Yvette's quick ears would naturally catch the accent<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>of the faubourg du Temple, since there she was born on the 20th of January 1867.<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>Yet this girl needed but to be cast for an interesting part in order to reveal the powers<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>of uttering comedy and tragedy that slumbered behind her ambitions. When Yvette Guilbert<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>first stepped before the footlights, Paris was without a prophet. At the Nouveautes she<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>made her courtesy to the public in her twenty-second year in a one act play by Albert<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>Brasseur. The thrill of facing the footlights was hers alone; neither audience nor manager<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>saw much more than the defects. At the she, however, was playing in the following<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>year with Rejane, Jadic, Baron, Lassouche, and others of a wide vogue; but neither players<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>nor public had wits enough to recognise the genius of the slim beginner, so eager for conquest.<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>At last, one fine day, Yvette Guilbert, checked and baffled by the utter lack of recognition<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>on all hands, saw that the legitimate stage was not going to yield her the position for which<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>she felt certain that she was capable; so it came about that, thanks to an energy that has<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>never failed her, she abandoned the theatre and went straight to the music-hall, boldly<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>asking Madame Allemand, the directress of Eldorado for an engagement. Madame Allemand,<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>with her shrewd eye for budding talent, put the young woman through her paces and offered<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>the delighted Yvette twenty four pounds a month! But the public were not used to the<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>style and the personality of the newcomer and passed her performances by, unapplauding,<lb facs="P8_TL00045"/>which brought regret to Madame Allemand as to her prophecies and suspicions that she<lb facs="P8_TL00046"/>had been mistaken in her discovery of a future star in the gaunt girl, so that she was soon<lb facs="P8_TL00047"/>putting Yvette on the stage at the opening of the evening's entertainement to sing to the<lb facs="P8_TL00048"/>empty benches, "wiping the boards" as the actor's slang has it.^<lb facs="P8_TL00049"/>Although Madame Allemand thus saved the digestions of the later arriving frequenters of<lb facs="P8_TL00050"/>the Eldorado from the undue strain of trying to praise what they could not appreciate,<lb facs="P8_TL00051"/>Yvette was not made of the stuff that seeks to cajole misunderstanding and disdain, or is glad<lb facs="P8_TL00052"/>to be accepted with sufferance. In some distress she protested; and her directress, frankly<lb facs="P8_TL00053"/>owning that her hopes in the girl had wholly failed, offered to cancel her contract or to<lb facs="P8_TL00054"/>give her half her former wage to remain and continue to " Wipe the boards " every night.<lb facs="P8_TL00055"/>Yvette, furious, vowed that she would never again sing there until she was offered for every<lb facs="P8_TL00056"/>evening the twenty-four pounds that they now refused to give her a month, and walked<lb facs="P8_TL00057"/>out of the Eldorado slamming the door behind her. &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00058"/>The rest of the story is well known. That door slammed also upon Yvette Guilbert's</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P9_TB00002">
                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00002"/>"wiping of the boards". She wiped the boards no longer; nor sang to empty benches. At<lb facs="P9_TL00003"/>the Concert Parisien she made her hit, and was soon a star, and of the first magnitude.<lb facs="P9_TL00004"/>In less than a couple of years from the slamming of that door, Madame Allemand was signing<lb facs="P9_TL00005"/>a contract with Yvette Guilbert to sing for twenty«four pounds a night, and there was no<lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>clause about wiping the boards..,. At twenty=five she was a sensation. The hoardings soon<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>held posters on which she figured in rare designs by Sautrec; and Steinler has drawn her.<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>Good fortune came early to her, as it needs must come to an actress, if ever.<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>The rest of her years have been one long triumph. It was her tireless energy, not her art,<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>that played her false at last. She burnt the candle at both ends, illness struck her down,<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>and her life came near to paying the forfeit. But her strong will and love of life overcame<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>the weakness of her frail body; and, having recovered from her nervous breakdown after<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>a long absence from before the footlights, she reappeared at the Olympia, where she received<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>such a tumultous ovation, and was so profoundly moved by the enthusiasm, that she lost<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>her nerve, was unable to sing, and could only stammer forth the assurance of her happinness<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>to be amongst them all again. They shouted for her to sing. " I beg your pardon " she<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>said pathetically " but.... I cannot". &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>However, she soon overcome the nervous strain that had nearly brought her to the grave;<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>and has won to fame over the wide world. And it is not the least part of her bright<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>achievement that she has breathed life again into the old French ballad that had lain so<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>long forgotten, folded and put away in lavender in the lumber rooms of a great people's<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>historic and romantic past.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>Jncluding the doubtful one, there are no less than five plays<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>devoted more or lass to Greek story and one with a background<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>so far deiived from Greece that I take leave to class it with<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>the others. These six plays refer to four different periods, and<lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>maybe chronologically arranged as follows:—<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>A Midsummer Night's Dream . )<lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>Troilus and Cressida. ... . j 1184—990<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>Winter's Tale<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>t- o ... B.C. 430—407<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>Timon of Athens <lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>Pericles B.C. 190<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>Comedy of Errors A.D. 300<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>But in affixing approximate dates for the action to these<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>dramas I see no reason why certain of them—namely A<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>Midsummer Night's Dream, Winter's Tale, and the Comedy of<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>Errors— should not be considered as wholly belonging to<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>their author's time. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>The proper names, Athens, Theseus, Hippolyta, /€;gle, Ariadne,<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>which occur in A Midsummer Night's Dream, are no doubt<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>eminently Greek, but the woods where the two girls Hermia<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>and Helena 44 upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie " are<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>as English as the clowns and the fairies, than which nothing<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>can be more English. The fact that Theseus refers to his<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>battle with the Amazons, and how he first conquered<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>and then loved their Queen, Hippolyta, although strictly in<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>accordance with the classic legend is hardly sufficient to weigh</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P10_TB00007">
                                    <lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>down the host of improbabilities that crowd the stage when this play is produced with costume,<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>&amp;c., in imitation of Greek fashions. Again, when Theseus talks of the livery of a nun,<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>shady cloisters, and the like, he is of course distinctly referring to the votaries of Diana;<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>and when the ladies and gentlemen swear they swear by pagan deities, although the names<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>they give them are Roman. But Puck and Bottom—nay, even tall Helena and proud Titania<lb facs="P10_TL00044"/>—each is quite enough to overweigh the Greek element in the play. Still, if it must be<lb facs="P10_TL00045"/>produced with classic accessories, we should do well to be true to the little there is of classic<lb facs="P10_TL00046"/>reference. Thus, although Theseus, in the heroic character we have of him, may be a myth,<lb facs="P10_TL00047"/>still the connection of his name with that of fair Helen of Troy brings the man within the<lb facs="P10_TL00048"/>range of archaeology. And thus we should be led to place his union with Hippolyta only a<lb facs="P10_TL00049"/>few years before the siege of Troy. R&gt;r although the story of the Trojan war was not long<lb facs="P10_TL00050"/>ago regarded by every scholar as fabulous, with no more foundation at the furthest than<lb facs="P10_TL00051"/>that which might be derived from the settlement of the Greeks on the north-west coast of<lb facs="P10_TL00052"/>Asia, now—if we accept as genuine the excavations and discoveries made by Dr. Schliemann—<lb facs="P10_TL00053"/>we cannot but have some hesitation before we venture to draw a hard and fast line between<lb facs="P10_TL00054"/>the fact and the fiction of the legend, if then the play of A Midsummer Night's Dream<lb facs="P10_TL00055"/>must needs be acted, and if it must needs be classically clothed—and there are many reasons<lb facs="P10_TL00056"/>against both ifs—the architecture, costume, and accessories may very well be the same as<lb facs="P10_TL00057"/>those in the play of Troilus and Cressida. One thing is or ought to be, quite clear, and<lb facs="P10_TL00058"/>that is, that the Acropolis of Athens, as we know it, with its Parthenon, Erectheium, and<lb facs="P10_TL00059"/>Propvlae, has just about as much relation to the Greeks of the time of Ulysses or Theuses<lb facs="P10_TL00060"/>as the Reform Club has to King John. We have, indeed, to travel back, not merely beyond<lb facs="P10_TL00061"/>the time of the Parthenon (438-420 B.C.), or beyond that of its predecessor (650 B.C.), but<lb facs="P10_TL00062"/>beyond the days of Hesiod and Homer (900 B.C.), past the Dorian conquest of the Achaians<lb facs="P10_TL00063"/>in Peloponn&amp;sos, and so higher up the stream of time until we reach the early period of</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P11_TL00002"/>the Pelasgic civilisation. The siege of Troy has been calculated by some to have happened<lb facs="P11_TL00003"/>B.C. 1194=1184; by others it has been placed as far back as fifteen centuries; that is to say,<lb facs="P11_TL00004"/>before the foundation of Nineveh, and during the Egyptian rule in Assyria. The uncertainty<lb facs="P11_TL00005"/>thus shown leaves us free to choose between four dates. 1. The time of the author of the<lb facs="P11_TL00006"/>play (1600 A.D.). 2, The time of the author of the story (900 B.C.). 3- The date<lb facs="P11_TL00007"/>assigned by one group of antiquaries to the events recorded in the story (1184 B.C.). 4. The<lb facs="P11_TL00008"/>date assigned by some classical scholars as about the period of the siege of Troy (1500 B.C.).<lb facs="P11_TL00009"/>As the difference between the latest date suggested for the real siege and the accepted<lb facs="P11_TL00010"/>approximate date of Homer's story of it is less than three centuries, as the poet may possibly<lb facs="P11_TL00011"/>have incorporated into his work much that in his day was received as genuine tradition, as<lb facs="P11_TL00012"/>both in Homer and Hesiod we have the most detailed descriptions to guide us, and as it may<lb facs="P11_TL00013"/>be possible to reconcile much, if not most of Dr. Schliemann's genuine discoveries with the<lb facs="P11_TL00014"/>descriptions, I would accept the period, 1184=900 B.C., in preference to any later or earlier<lb facs="P11_TL00015"/>time as that wherein to seek the architecture and costume of the two plays above mentioned.<lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>A Room in the Palace of Theseus is the only architectural scene in a Midsummer Night's<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>Dream, and for the character of this interior we must turn to Assyria and Persepolis, to the<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>descriptions of Solomon's Temple and house of the Forest of Lebanon (B.C. 1005), and the<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>fragments of Mycense and other Pelasgic towns. (See Layard's " Nineveh " and Texier's<lb facs="P11_TL00020"/>" Asia Minor"). &gt;6?<lb facs="P11_TL00021"/>&amp; In Troilus and Cressida we have in the text twenty-five Scenes, of which five are<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>architectural. These are<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>1. Before Priam's palace.<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>2. A room in the same.<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>3. A street in Troy.<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>4. A court before the house of Pandarus*<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>5. A room in the same.<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>In the background of many of the scenes outside the town might loom the " embattled<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>walls, " the " lofty towers, " and the Scaean gate of world-famed Ilium, only it may be as<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>well to bear in mind that what an inhabitant of London, or Paris, or Carcassonne in the<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>fourteenth century thought of embattled walls and lofty towers was a very different sort<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>of thing from what a Greek understood by these words, for the word topats simply meant<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>a strong walled building; and thus the pylons of an Egyptian temple and the wings of the<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>Propylsea at Athens were equally towers in the Greek sense. The bas-reliefs from<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>Sennacherib's palace at Koyunjik (B. C. 700) tell us something about embattled walls and<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>gates. The walls might be built in regular coursed work, as at Mycenae, or of polygonal<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>masonry, like the street paving discovered on the hill of Hissarlik. Shakspere, like Homer,<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>does not fail to tell us that one tower was higher than the others (Act I. Sc. 2), but beyond<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>this he says nothing that would illustrate the work classically or mediaevally. The dramatist,<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>however, marks distinctly the separation between the town of Troy and Ilium—in other<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>words, between the town and the palace of Priam or the Acropolis, the citadel or stronghold,<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>or Pergamus, wherein stood not only the King's house, but the temple and the store houses,<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>and where also the eastern tower stood, from which the battle-field was overlooked by<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>Hecuba and Helen. The exaggerations that invariably accumulate round the nucleus of fact<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>in all stories of heroic deeds must be allowed for when we come to estimate the evidence<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>as to the siaie and arrangement of Troy. If the city really stood on the hill of Hissarlik, and<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>Dr. Schliemann be right in his conclusions (1) then the city was no larger than many mediaeval<lb facs="P11_TL00048"/>fortresses with which we are familiar. If, on the other hand, the works exhumed on Hissarlik<lb facs="P11_TL00049"/>represent only the extent of the citadel or Pergamus of Troy, then the boundaries of the city<lb facs="P11_TL00050"/>itself may be extended on one side (the south) of it, like an Assyrian city, to almost any distance<lb facs="P11_TL00051"/>compatible with the probabilities of the case. So, then, for Priam's house we have to choose<lb facs="P11_TL00052"/>between a palace not much better than a pele or border tower, capable of accommodating<lb facs="P11_TL00053"/>about twenty people at the utmost, and one arranged after the plan of those at Nimroud<lb facs="P11_TL00054"/>(B.C. 900), Khorsabad, or Koyunjik. If it be the first, then Homer's language is high faluting<lb facs="P11_TL00055"/>from beginning to end; but if the last be the right view to take of it, then the poet's<lb facs="P11_TL00056"/>descriptions may very fairly be examined in any endeavour we may make to realise the<lb facs="P11_TL00057"/>architecture of Troy for the scenic purposes of the play of Troilus and Cressida.^</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P12_TB00003">
                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00004"/>In the sixth book of the " Iliad " we are told that Priam's stately courts were raised<lb facs="P12_TL00005"/>on columns of stupendous frame, that—<lb facs="P12_TL00006"/>O' er these a range of marble structure runs<lb facs="P12_TL00007"/>The rich pavilions of his fifty sons,<lb facs="P12_TL00008"/>and that opposite to the sons' lodgings were those devoted to the daughters and their<lb facs="P12_TL00009"/>husbands. In the " Odyssey " one of the palaces has a high hall with walls of flaming<lb facs="P12_TL00010"/>brass, a blue cornice, doors framed of gold set with silver pilasters and lintel; each side<lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>the doorway is a dog wrought in silver and gold, and from the threshold skirting the walls<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>are thrones or couches reaching—<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>in lustrous long array,<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>On to the far room, where the women met,<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>With many a rich robe strewn and woven coverlet.<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>This hall, whose roof=tree is supported on pillars, is lighted for the night feasts by torches<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>placed in the outstretched hands of golden figures of youths raised on pedestals. And in<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>the corridor also are seats or couches against the walls on which beds are made up for<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>the stranger and the guest. Coming to details, we find that the doors are made folding,<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>like the Japanese doors of the present day, and that they are fastened by bolts passing<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>through silver rings. Bronze and ivory are combined with the metals already mentioned<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>in the decoration of the pillars and walls, against which hang various armour and musical<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>instruments. There is, too, one kind of ornament which is constantly recurring, for we<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>read of silver and gold studding as a very common mode of decoration applied somewhat<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>indiscriminately to costume as well as to furniture and buildings. The stairs leading to the<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>upper chambers appear generally to start from near the entrance to the hall, and in the<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>larger palaces it would seem that the buildings were arranged in separate blocks round a<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>common quadrangle or court.<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>&amp; The house of Pandarus would have the usual arrangement of outer court, vestibule,<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>pillared hall, and stairs leading to the private apartments above. &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>A street in Troy would possess many of these houses more or less capacious, some<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>separated from one another by orchards and gardens, and some doubtless jostled by many<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>rough«built tenements of a different class of inhabitants—assuming, that is, that Troy meant<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>something more than the walled enclosure on the hill of Hissarlik mapped out for us in<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>Dr. Schliemann's book. For the mise en scene of the drama before us I am disposed to<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>accept the grander view, and to take Homer's colouring of things as tolerably literal, after<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>allowing for poetical license.<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>costume of Greeks and Trojans in that wide=margined period of time that I selected<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>for the action of Troilus and Cressida, i.e., 1184=900 B.C., is by no means<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>ready to our hands. We cannot refer as we did for the Merchant of Venice and other<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>plays, where the period of the action was taken to be in the author's own time, to illustrated<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>guide books of unquestionable authority, like Vecellio, following which it was impossible to<lb facs="P12_TL00043"/>go wrong unless by malice aforethought or the crassest ignorance. Nor can we refer, as I<lb facs="P12_TL00044"/>did for Cymbeline, to collections of armour, &amp;c., such as that interesting Keltic group<lb facs="P12_TL00045"/>which exists in the British Museum. The earliest Greek vases in the British Museum and<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>the pinax or plate (No. 16 Table, Case B), crude and early as they may be, are yet too late<lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>for us by four or five centuries. There may have been, there probably was, far less<lb facs="P12_TL00048"/>changeableness in the fashions of building, dress, furniture, ornaments, and implements in<lb facs="P12_TL00049"/>those heroic days than in any subsequent period. Three or four centuries, two thousand<lb facs="P12_TL00050"/>three hundred years ago, witnessed, I have little doubt, less change in costume than did<lb facs="P12_TL00051"/>any score of years in the Middle Ages. Still, we must not think, I imagine, as is too often<lb facs="P12_TL00052"/>supposed from the way in which Greek things are usually spoken of, that Hellenic art sprung<lb facs="P12_TL00053"/>into being fully grown and completely equipped like the blue«eyed maid, Pallas Athene.<lb facs="P12_TL00054"/>Styles of art, whether in the shape of architecture or costume, sculpture or painting, or<lb facs="P12_TL00055"/>anything else, have always been a=growing, passing through the usual process of all growth-<lb facs="P12_TL00056"/>Development, Fulness, Decline. At certain periods of the world's history, and in certain<lb facs="P12_TL00057"/>countries, this growth was exceedingly slow, in others exceedingly fast. In the English<lb facs="P12_TL00058"/>historical plays we had to do with the fast. We have now to deal with the slow. Therefore,<lb facs="P12_TL00059"/>although the earliest figure=painted vessels in the First Vase-Room of the Museum may not<lb facs="P12_TL00060"/>take us further back than 500 years before Christ, and the sculptures from the Temple at</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P13_TL00002"/>may lead us certainly to no earlier period, yet by taking these as our point de<lb facs="P13_TL00003"/>depa.it, and so going up the stream of time until we reach the north-west palace at Nimroud,<lb facs="P13_TL00004"/>c. 900 B.C., we may, by the collateral assistance of Homer and Hesiod, together with such<lb facs="P13_TL00005"/>evidence as may be derived from Keltic remains, be enabled to arrive at something like a<lb facs="P13_TL00006"/>possible, if not probable, conclusion as to the costume of Achaeans and Trojans in the Heroic<lb facs="P13_TL00007"/>days. Nor must we forget the influence of the Phoenicians or Canaanites through the art<lb facs="P13_TL00008"/>manufactures of their great trading cities, Tyre and Sidon, when Hiram was King of Tyre<lb facs="P13_TL00009"/>(1,000 B.C.). &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00010"/>And now let us first of all turn to Hesiod and Homer. From these we gather, to begin with,<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>such a wealth of mere material that, quite apart from art, indicates no mean degree of<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>civilisation. Among these we find mention made of gems, gold, silver, brass, tin, steel, iron,<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>electrum (" Odyssey "), ivory, fine linen, costly furs, skins, carpets, soft wool, horsehair, and<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>costly scents. The art processes employed were studding, repousse work (1), chasing,<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>embroidery, and weaving. If a richly wrought silver urn or goblet was wanted, it was<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>sought in the workshop of some Sidonian artist; if the fine products of the loom had to be<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>made all glorious with needlework, it was to the subtle fingers of Sidonian maids they were<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>entrusted; and if a lovely colour was desired, it was to Tyre the home manufacturer was<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>indebted for its dye. And here we cannot fail to be reminded of a singer who was possibly<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>a contemporary of Homer's, or at any rate of his father's: — "All thy garments smell of<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad....<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>Upon thy right hand did stand the Queen in gold of ophir.... And the daughter of Tyre shall<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>be there with a gift.... The King's daughter is all glorious within; her clothing is of wrought<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>gold. She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework ". Of colours a natural<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>yellowish or toned white (milk white and not snow white) was the most usual for ali woollen<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>garments; the fine linen vests were also mostly white: red, purple, and various yellows<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>ranging from pale saffron to a green-gold were likewise used, but purple includes blue<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>(violet-blue) as well as the royal colour, or purple proper, where the red takes its full<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>share of partnership, and red means a scarlet, or brilliant crimson rather than vermilion:<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>\<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>—" My lips are like a thread of scarlet" shows by the natural simile the quality of the<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>" scarlet" here intended by Solomon. As to the several articles of dress, the " Iliad "<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>supplies us with minute particulars, and from these we learn that the full armour, which<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>was mostly made of brass, consisted of: —1, the helmet; 2, the thorax or cuirasse over a<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>linen vest; 3, the cuissots or thigh pieces, and 4, the greaves: no mention is anywhere made<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>of the leather, felt or metal straps which we find depending from the lower edge of the<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>cuirasse in the armed figures on vases of a much later period. Of belts we have three kinds,<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>the zone or waist belt, the sword belt, and the shield belt. Besides the sword and shield<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>we have the spear, the bow, and the iron-studded mace, which last is very suggestive of<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>the morning-star or holy water-sprinkler of mediaeval armouries. The men wore the hair<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>long, and their skin was brown. The costume of the fair sex seems to have depended for<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>its effect not so much on quantity as on quality, and more than anything else on the<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>proportion, articulation, and undulation of the splendour of human form. The chiton or<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>tunic, the broad zone, the diplax, pallium, or mantle sweeping the ground, the peplos or<lb facs="P13_TL00045"/>veil, the sandals, and the head dress formed a complete toilette, Among their personal<lb facs="P13_TL00046"/>ornaments were ear-rings, diadems or frontals, chains, brooches, and necklaces. £?<lb facs="P13_TL00047"/>And now turn to the actors in this drama. Taking the Greeks first, we have Achilles<lb facs="P13_TL00048"/>presented to us as golden-haired; his sceptre is starred with gold studs; his greaves are of<lb facs="P13_TL00049"/>ductile tin; his cuissots are of silver; his cuirasse of gold; his fourfold helm of sculptured<lb facs="P13_TL00050"/>(repousse) brass with a golden crest of horsehair gilded; his shield of gold, silver, brass,<lb facs="P13_TL00051"/>and tin divided by concentric rings, each divided into four compartments; his sword is of<lb facs="P13_TL00052"/>bronze starred with gems; and his baldrick is embroidered in various colours. Agamemnon<lb facs="P13_TL00053"/>wears, when unarmed, a fine linen vest, a purple mantle, embroidered sandals, and a lion's<lb facs="P13_TL00054"/>skin at night over his shoulders. When armed he wears a four-fold helm with horsehair<lb facs="P13_TL00055"/>plume; greaves with silver buckles; a wonderful cuirasse composed of ten rows of azure<lb facs="P13_TL00056"/>steel, twenty of tin, and twelve of gold, with three dragons rising to the neck; a baldrick<lb facs="P13_TL00057"/>radiant with embroidery; a sword with gold hilt, silver sheath, and gold hangers; a broad<lb facs="P13_TL00058"/>belt with silver plates; and a shield of ten concentric bands or zones of brass, with twenty</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P14_TB00003">
                                    <lb facs="P14_TL00004"/>bosses and a Gorgon in the midst. Menelaus wears a leopard's skin at night. Old Nestor's<lb facs="P14_TL00005"/>mantle is of warm, soft wool, doubly lined; his shield is of gold, and he wears a scarf of<lb facs="P14_TL00006"/>divers colours. Diomed's armour is of ordinary brass or bronze, until he exchanges it for<lb facs="P14_TL00007"/>the gold-inlaid equipments of Glaucus. Ajax is clothed in steel, and carries a terrific mace<lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>crowned with studs of iron, whilst Patroclus wears brass, silver buckled, a flaming cuirasse<lb facs="P14_TL00009"/>of a thousand dyes, a sword studded with gold, and a sword-belt like a starry zone. On<lb facs="P14_TL00010"/>the Trojan side we see Hektor with a shield teaching from neck to ankle; a plume or<lb facs="P14_TL00011"/>crest of white and black horsehair (i); a brass cuirasse and spears about sixteen feet long.<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>Paris, in curling golden tresses, comes before us in gilded armour, buckled with silver<lb facs="P14_TL00013"/>buckles; his thigh-pieces are wrought with flowers; his helmet is fastened by a strap of<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>tough bull-hide; a leopard's skin he wears as a cloak, and his bow hangs across his shoulders.<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>Of the fair Helen Homer says but little; he infers that her fairness bewitched everyone<lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>who saw her, the old white-headed men sitting in the gate, as well as the middleaged<lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>and the young. We see her at her tapestry, wherein with golden thread she is picturing<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>the strife of war and bitter passion which has been roused by her unbounded beauty and<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>her fatal frailty. We see her pass out of the palace, attended by her two handmaidens,<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>her face and arms covered by a thin white peplos, her soft, white chiton tucked up through<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>the gold zone beneath her swelling bosom, and her embroidered diplax fastened with clasps<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>of gold, whilst both peplos and diplax fall in multitudinous folds until they lose themselves<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>in a train of rippling waves. The picture of Andromache in the twenty-second book shows<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>us the noble wife far in the close recesses of her house withdrawn, weaving a web<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>all purple, double woof,<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>With varied flowers in rich embroidery;<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>and mindful of the father of her children, she is giving orders to the servants to prepare<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>for his return. But Hektor was dead, and when she learnt this, <lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>Backward she fell, and gasped her spirit away,<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>Far off were flung th'adornments of her head —<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>The net, the fillet, and the woven bands;<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>The nuptial veil by golden Venus given,<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>upon her bridal day.<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>Such, then, is the evidence we gather from Homer as to the costume of Troilus and Cressida;<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>Hesiod, in so far as he refers to costume, supports it. Now, therefore, let us examine the<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>testimony offered by the arts of painting and sculpture. We will begin with the shield.<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>There can be no manner of doubt that the shield, as described by the poets just mentioned,<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>was of far greater diameter than any we see modelled in the /Egina sculptures, or painted<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>on plate or vase. These are scarcely more than thirty inches in diameter, or six inches<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>more than the largest Keltic shield, but the Homeric shield must have had a diameter nearly<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>if not quite double this unless our Classic heroes were very short men. Where, then, shall<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>we most easily find a genuine illustration of this gigantic kind of shield? This question,<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>thanks to the labours of Mr Layard, is readily answered, for on a slab from the Palace at<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>Koyunjik (c. 700 B.C.), now preserved in the Lower Assyrian Room in Great Russell Street,<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>is sculptured in low-relief a row of shields of the exact Homeric dimension — i.e. reaching<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>from neck to ankle, and fully illustrating the convex form, the outer rim, and the central<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>boss. Most of these large shields were doubtless made of bull's hides, and only coated with<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>metal plates. This method of construction, i.e. overlaying a leather foundation with thin<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>metal, was probably also adopted in the manufacture of the earlier helmets. Among early<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>protections for the head occur hats or helmets, which appear to have been made of skin,<lb facs="P14_TL00051"/>leather, or felt. On a black obelisk in the British Museum, dated S50 B.C., we see on the<lb facs="P14_TL00052"/>attendants a conical cap evidently of soft material, the point falling back, and the margin<lb facs="P14_TL00053"/>turned up like a band; in other words, a Phrygian cap wrong side on. So also the skull<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P14_TL00054"/>cap form seen in the early Etruskan, Macedonian, and Cyprian helmets, and the peculiar<lb facs="P14_TL00055"/>horned shapes seen in our Keltic collection, at Falaise, and in the early representations of<lb facs="P14_TL00056"/>Herakles are very suggestive of a skin or leather prototype. But the dramatis petsonse<lb facs="P14_TL00057"/>in Troilus and Cressida must have something more than this. Both Greek and Trojan must<lb facs="P14_TL00058"/>have " bronze bound peaked helms " and lofty crests, with nodding plumes of horsehair.<lb facs="P14_TL00059"/>Now in Table Case B, in the First Vase-Room of the Museum is a plate or pinax (No. 19) on</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P15_TB00002">
                                    <lb facs="P15_TL00002"/>which is represented a combat between Menelaos and Hektor over the body of Euphorbos.<lb facs="P15_TL00003"/>The date of the work is probably four or even five centuries too late for us, and I only<lb facs="P15_TL00004"/>mention it to call attention to the form of the crest, which is nothing more than the curling<lb facs="P15_TL00005"/>point of the Phrygian cap slightly raised and translated into metal, and to the curved back<lb facs="P15_TL00006"/>of which the horsehair is fastened. Now with an accurate drawing of this Greek helmet in<lb facs="P15_TL00007"/>our hands, let us go down again to the Koyunjik slabs, where we found the shields, and<lb facs="P15_TL00008"/>we can see in the helmets of the Assyrian warriors precisely the same arrangement. It is<lb facs="P15_TL00009"/>true that there is nothing in the sculptures of the Nineveh Palace indicating any guard or<lb facs="P15_TL00010"/>defence for the face, but there are ear=pieces—in some instances they are small, in others<lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>large; in some homogeneous, in others attached, as in the Keltic example illustrated in the<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>Archseolegischen Analectem These crested helms are always or nearly so;<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>for the early conical or peaked helm is crestless, although supplied with the ear guards,<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>so necessary to a smooth cIose=fitting casque. Another marked distinction between the<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>drawing on the Greek pinax and the carving on the Assyrian slab is wholly in favour of<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>the latter as an illustration of Homer. In the Greek example the hair is worn short, and<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>the neck is protected by projecting wings or curtains forming part of the helm—an<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>arrangement familiar to us in the form of the 15th century salade, but on the slab the hair<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>is shown thick, long, and curly, as the natural defence for the neck and as worn by the<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>Homeric heroes. &amp;?&amp;&amp;&amp;?<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>The usual surface decoration of the helm appears to have consisted of one or more concentric<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>bands with semicircular frontals. These borders once created, we can quite understand<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>that the Sidonian artists skilful to work in gold and in silver, in brass and in iron, and to<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>grave any manner of graving, would not be slow to avail themselves of the field thus offered<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>for the exercise of their art. The Homeric cuirasse is always more or less flaming, i.e.,<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>shimmering with light and colour—colour partly in itself and partly reflected. Agamemnon's<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>coat, as we have already seen, contains forty=two rows of three different metals, that of<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>Patroclus flames with a thousand dyes, that of Achilles outshines the fire, and so on. I can<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>hardly imagine that such descriptions as these can refer to any other style of cuirasse than<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>that formed by bands, scales, or plates of metal (some, perhaps, enamelled) fastened to a<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>leather or skin foundation, something, that is to say, between the flexible horn cuirasse or<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>coat of mail and the metal plate armour that was moulded to fit every muscle of the body.<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>This kind of cuirasse would be supported by shou!der=straps or braces, fastened to the<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>breast and back pieces by studs, or tied with strips of hide. It was probably Agamemnon's<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>leathern braces that were decorated with the crawling dragons or griffins. That this leathern<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>jerkin, if i may be allowed the unclasslcal expression, descended lower than the abdomen<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>is not likely, otherwise there would have been no need for the cuissots or thigh plates.<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>Nor does it seem that it could have been as short as the later form of lorica or thorax, for<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>if so there was no need for the broad waist=belt or zone. Now if we suppose that the<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>cuirasse was in two pieces, one for the front and one for the back, it follows that without<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>the zone the sides would be exposed, thus the waist=&gt;belt becomes a very important feature,<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>and we can readily understand how the word would be used in the sense of to arm<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>one's-self. The cuissots were buckled behind the thighs, and the greaves were sometimes<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>fastened in the same manner, although the natural spring of the metal (when they were<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>formed of metal only) would be sufficient to hold them in place. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>For the women's armlets, bracelets, necklaces, and earrings (1); for the woven patterns,<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>and the embroidered borders of the square mantle and the chiton, we cannot be far wrong<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>if we seek in the sculptures of the reign of Assur»nazir=«pal (c. B.C. 880). Necklaces of beads<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>and of numerous small pendants might be used, if preferred, instead of the bolder medallion<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>necklace. The twisted snake-like form as well as the single medallion may be used for<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>bracelets. The hair was rolled up and confined within a caul or net, made of coloured or<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>gold thread, and a fillet not unusually of thin fine gold bound the base of the net. This<lb facs="P15_TL00053"/>fillet, in the cases of very important ladies, might expand into a frontal or diadem of thin<lb facs="P15_TL00054"/>gold, bent round the forehead from ear to ear and decorated with very delicate repousse work.<lb facs="P15_TL00055"/>&amp; Of the furniture for this play the Ninevite sculptures supply sufficient material, if taken<lb facs="P15_TL00056"/>in conjunction with the poet's language, to enable an intelligent stage director to furnish<lb facs="P15_TL00057"/>the interior scenes, if not with accuracy, at least without any display of inconsistency. &lt;£?</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00005"/>J have just come across this charming Italian wood engraving, and because I believe it will<lb facs="P16_TL00006"/>be of great interest to the modern stage director, and will appeal to his passion for<lb facs="P16_TL00007"/>correct detail, I hasten to bring it before him. It is made for the modern stage director.<lb facs="P16_TL00008"/>The artist evidently knew the modern stage director was coming. Of course it is utterly<lb facs="P16_TL00009"/>incomplete in execution, this wood cut: technique has not been the designer's aim: realistic<lb facs="P16_TL00010"/>detail, that is what has absorbed him, and curiously enough just the very detail by which<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>the stage director knows his public is charmed. &lt;£?<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>&amp; Here is the real horse tethered to the real wall: the real dog and the real pigeon and<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>the real pigeon house, just as described by Miss Ellen Terry in her Memoirs, where she<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>alludes to one of Charles Reade's productions.<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>&amp; 1 think that it never yet occurred to any stage manager to ha&gt;e real bees; yet of what<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>value would be the presence of the man and the woman, of the horse and the dog and the<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>old lady spinning in this design without the bees? Therefore what would a production<lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>in which are a man and a woman, a horse, a dog and an old lady spinning be without<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>this additional detail of bees? What an opportunity for realism, for accuracy I Think what<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>possibilities it opens up! Think of the laughs to be extracted from a bee. If in a<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>Shakespearean play the leading man were continually being stung on the nose by a bee,<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>how it would punctuate the poetry! And really, when you come to think of it, what is there<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>against Malvolio being chased by bees? I suppose bees were of the period? I am not so<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>sure that a modern stage manager would not be justified in going so far as to announce<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>on the posters, Tonight: Shakespeare's " Twelfth Night, or the Pigeons and the Bees " &amp;</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P17_TB00002">
                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00002"/>por my part I cannot understand those people who object to stage directions being written<lb facs="P17_TL00003"/>by the dramatist. Mr Bernard Shaw's stage directions, rather than being too profuse,<lb facs="P17_TL00004"/>are not profuse enough. He beats about the bush: he does not really close with the<lb facs="P17_TL00005"/>difficulty at all. Some day some one will improve upon Mr Bernard Shaw in this respect,<lb facs="P17_TL00006"/>and then we may hope for really complete directions such as the following. &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00007"/>" The bees are now heard buzzing about the hive. It seems for one moment as<lb facs="P17_TL00008"/>" if the queen bee were dead, but the next moment the air is cleared of all apprehension<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>" and becomes thick with bees. They circle twice around the forest and alight upon<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>"an ash tree which may be discerned three miles distant. Care should be taken by the<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>" manipulator to distinguish between the working bees and the drones (i).<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>« At the same instant the pigeons should leave the loft which is on the right hand side<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>" of the stage, the reflection of which must be just visible in the pool of water which covers<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>" the front of the stage. The pigeons must be seen in the mirror of the pool flying towards<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>the east, they themselves being invisible (2).<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>" The sound of a horse pawing the ground must now be heard, but the noise is quickly<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>" drowned by the crowing of a cock. As imitations of the crowing of a cock proceed at times<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>" from the audience, the manager must be very careful to procure a genuine cock so that<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>" there shall be no doubt as to the authenticity of the crowing (3). A butterfly should<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>" here flit across the stage (4). Mary is then seen coming out of the house on the left. The<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>" first few words she utters denote her temperament. " Lamb for dinner, lamb for breakfast,<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>" Iamb for lunch. " It must be at once evident that she is a pronounced vegetarian and a<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>" suffragette.<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>&amp; Truly, the study of the stage is a very pleasant one for the playwright of today, and<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>the more so that, with the happy liberty allowed him by Realism, he is without difficulty<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>enabled to offer us so many different sensations.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00004"/>n a little book which I published in 1905 I ventured to agree<lb facs="P18_TL00005"/>with those who hold the opinion that Shakespeare's plays<lb facs="P18_TL00006"/>were written for the reader and not for the stage. It seems<lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>many hold this opinion. Yet it was a satisfaction to me to<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>come later across the following and other sentences in<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>Goethe's writings. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>sg? 44 Shakespeare belongs by rights to the history of poetry;<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>44 in the history of the theatre he only appears casually "<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>44 Shakespeare's whole method of proceeding is one which<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>44 encounters a certain amount of impracticability upon the<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>44 actual stage ". &amp; jg? &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>44 The very contractedness of the stage forces him to<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>circumscribe himself." £?</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P18_TB00006">
                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>Goethe comes to this conclusion, not at the beginning of his life but at the end of it,<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>after his experience in the theatre has shown him that literature and the stage are, and must<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>be, independent one of the other. I still remain of the same opinion that Shakespeare's<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>plays are not for representation, more expecially because I am myself now working on several<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>Shakespearean representations and therefore have occasion for passing in review the many<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>different 44 editions " as they are called, of Shakespeare, especially the stage editions,<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>and 1 am struck by one fact, and it is this: that the people who hold that Shakespeare was<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>a master of theatrical art cut away from these plays lines, passages, nay, whole scenes.....<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>these words, passages and scenes which, they say, were written for the stage. &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>&amp;To say a thing is perfect and then to mutilate it is most peculiar. If a manager wishes<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>to cut a play saying that it will be better understood by the public if he does so, it is<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>permissable provided he does not at the same time say that Shakespeare was a perfect master<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>of dramatic art. Drama is for the people if ever an art was for the people, and if Shakespeare<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>has not made himself clear to the people of all time, the actor manager is not going to<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>improve matters by cutting out large portions of the text.<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>In 44 Hamlet " it is usual for that long passage commencing 44 Now all occasions do<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>inform against me 44 to be removed by the manager, who says that it does not 44 help the<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>play." Now this is a most extraordinary state of affairs, that managers should be<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>permitted to say what does or does not44 help the plays "of Shakespeare, after Shakespeare<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>has himself decided. Other passages in the play are removed because the managers hold that<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>they are indelicate or they hold that the audience would consider them indelicate. Cut the<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>passage between Ophelia and Hamlet in Act III Scene 2 when he is lying at her feet and<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>you rob the character of Hamlet of very much of its force. Ophelia instead of being a<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>woman of intelligence, becomes an early Victorian debutante, and Hamlet, instead of being a<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>man of his time and suggesting a period which was more than a period of manners,<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>becomes a land of preaching curate. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>Of course the Censor would object to this and other passages in Shakespeare and he<lb facs="P18_TL00046"/>would be perfectly right, for the plays were not written for the stage; they were written<lb facs="P18_TL00047"/>to be read. If you wish to act them act them in their entirety or do not act them at all (i).<lb facs="P18_TL00048"/>It is as ridiculous to say that the omission of a small passage is not going to harm such a<lb facs="P18_TL00049"/>work as to say that the omission of so small a portion of the body as the eye does not<lb facs="P18_TL00050"/>injure the whole.<lb facs="P18_TL00051"/>This liberty with great plays is no sign of civilization; it is barbarous in the extreme.<lb facs="P18_TL00052"/>Another argument advanced for acting in this way is that the performance must not last<lb facs="P18_TL00053"/>longer than a certain time. Time has nothing to do with a performance. If it is good we<lb facs="P18_TL00054"/>do not mind how long it takes: if it is bad it must be cut short, and therefore to advocate<lb facs="P18_TL00055"/>a short time is to imply a fear on the part of the manager that the play is going to be<lb facs="P18_TL00056"/>badly represented. Can one have too much of a good thing ? Then, too, it is quite possible<lb facs="P18_TL00057"/>(1) " .... I am very glad to find that I can endorse Tieck's opinion when he shows himself to be a zealous upholder<lb facs="P18_TL00058"/>44 of the unity, indivisibility, and unassailableness of Shakespeare's plays, and insists on their being performed in their<lb facs="P18_TL00059"/>44 entirety and without revision or modification of any kind.

                                    <lb facs="P19_TL00002"/>to perform a play of Shakespeare in it entirety in an evening provided the appliance for<lb facs="P19_TL00003"/>shifting the scenery is not so absurdly elaborate that it takes twenty minutes to change<lb facs="P19_TL00004"/>each, act and provided that the actors do not pause too long over each syllable but exercise<lb facs="P19_TL00005"/>their brains to think a trifle faster. It is this slow delivery of Shakespeare's lines which<lb facs="P19_TL00006"/>has made Shakespeare a bore to so many people. Here in the plays of Shakespeare we<lb facs="P19_TL00007"/>have passionate scenes of an amazing description, far more amazing than in the plays of<lb facs="P19_TL00008"/>the south, and yet we drawl them and crawl them and are surprised when a Grasso<lb facs="P19_TL00009"/>comes to England and shows us how we should speak, act and reveal the suddenness and<lb facs="P19_TL00010"/>madness of passion. We seem to forget this fact, that passion is a kind of madness. We<lb facs="P19_TL00011"/>bring to it a logical attitude and we deliver it with the voice of the judge or the<lb facs="P19_TL00012"/>mathemetician. It seems to have something to do with the totting up of accounts; thus<lb facs="P19_TL00013"/>with us it is a shopman, not Othello, who is throttling Desdemona. The emotional actors<lb facs="P19_TL00014"/>in England ought not to be content with themselves for not waking up and sweeping all<lb facs="P19_TL00015"/>these too deliberate and stodgy actors off the stage and out of the theatres<lb facs="P19_TL00016"/>Would the plays of Shakespeare be then interpreted as they should be ? No, not even<lb facs="P19_TL00017"/>then. Not if the finest and most passionate actors in the world were to come together<lb facs="P19_TL00018"/>and attempt to perform Hamlet could the right representation of Hamlet be given, for<lb facs="P19_TL00019"/>to represent " Hamlet " rightly is an impossibility. j® &amp; *&amp; &amp;</ab>

The book has a<lb facs="P20_TL00009"/>short well-written preface by Mr H. B. Irving<lb facs="P20_TL00010"/>in which he states that his father had intended<lb facs="P20_TL00011"/>to have written his Reminiscences, and he<lb facs="P20_TL00012"/>adds, " No doubt that in these reminiscences<lb facs="P20_TL00013"/>44 Henry Irving would have given to those<lb facs="P20_TL00014"/>44 who came after him the fruits of his<lb facs="P20_TL00015"/>44 experience, the lessons learned, the ideas<lb facs="P20_TL00016"/>" formed in the course of a career of strenuous<lb facs="P20_TL00017"/>44 endeavour and singular achievement. "<lb facs="P20_TL00018"/>It appears that Henry Irving has not left<lb facs="P20_TL00019"/>any written works from which we may study<lb facs="P20_TL00020"/>except the small book which contains the<lb facs="P20_TL00021"/>lectures given at Oxford, Edinburgh, and<lb facs="P20_TL00022"/>other cities, so that any book which records<lb facs="P20_TL00023"/>conversations with Irving or which attempts<lb facs="P20_TL00024"/>to bring portions of his performances before<lb facs="P20_TL00025"/>our eyes is very welcome to admirers of the<lb facs="P20_TL00026"/>actor.<lb facs="P20_TL00027"/>Mr Pollock's book contains very many<lb facs="P20_TL00028"/>suggestive passages which help to remind us<lb facs="P20_TL00029"/>of those performances which we have seen. By<lb facs="P20_TL00030"/>the use of his well-chosen words he recalls<lb facs="P20_TL00031"/>to us very vividly the dusky brown stage of<lb facs="P20_TL00032"/>the theatre, the simple and unadorned<lb facs="P20_TL00033"/>dressing room: we hear again Irving's voice<lb facs="P20_TL00034"/>and we see once more his action and expression<lb facs="P20_TL00035"/>through Mr Pollock's art.<lb facs="P20_TL00036"/>Will those of the future generation be able<lb facs="P20_TL00037"/>to see the same? We doubt this very much,<lb facs="P20_TL00038"/>and we doubt whether the description of<lb facs="P20_TL00039"/>what an actor has done upon the stage and<lb facs="P20_TL00040"/>how he did it is of any assistance whatever<lb facs="P20_TL00041"/>to actors of the future; and for this reason:...<lb facs="P20_TL00042"/>We come across the passage about Irving's<lb facs="P20_TL00043"/>Iago, in which the author speaks of the<lb facs="P20_TL00044"/>performances of Othello and Iago, and as we<lb facs="P20_TL00045"/>had never seen either of these performances<lb facs="P20_TL00046"/>we were very much interested in reading<lb facs="P20_TL00047"/>what he had to say. But we cannot see<lb facs="P20_TL00048"/>Irving as Iago, we cannot picture him as<lb facs="P20_TL00049"/>Othello merely by reading this book, and we<lb facs="P20_TL00050"/>do not believe that however faithful the<lb facs="P20_TL00051"/>record might be that we should be able to<lb facs="P20_TL00052"/>picture him: therefore we should lose the<lb facs="P20_TL00053"/>essence of the thing. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00054"/>We are thus reminded of the worihlessness<lb facs="P20_TL00055"/>of tradition in an art which has no fixed<lb facs="P20_TL00056"/>rules.

The man who<lb facs="P21_TL00058"/>as actor-manager is running a theatre in<lb facs="P21_TL00059"/>London for his own profit is to be sympathised<lb facs="P21_TL00060"/>with, for, like a man on a treadmill, he must<lb facs="P21_TL00061"/>keep going on, at any cost and in face of<lb facs="P21_TL00062"/>any chance of failure. He has started out to<lb facs="P21_TL00063"/>cater for an uncertain public and must<lb facs="P21_TL00064"/>produce new plays and they must please (i).<lb facs="P21_TL00065"/>But the worst trouble is that if they are to<lb facs="P21_TL00066"/>please they must be not too unlike what</ab>

They must, though new,<lb facs="P21_TL00071"/>be still, as a rule, conventional. £?<lb facs="P21_TL00072"/>It is the same too with the actors. To achieve<lb facs="P21_TL00073"/>a success in one type of character is almost<lb facs="P21_TL00074"/>to be doomed to the perpetual representation<lb facs="P21_TL00075"/>of such types, at least until the uncertain<lb facs="P21_TL00076"/>public turn to some new favourite. Then if<lb facs="P21_TL00077"/>the actor essay another role.... though possibly<lb facs="P21_TL00078"/>with equal talent.... it is forthwith suggested<lb facs="P21_TL00079"/>that he had better stick to the parts he plays<lb facs="P21_TL00080"/>so well; which is acceptable advice only while<lb facs="P21_TL00081"/>such parts continue to be written.<lb facs="P21_TL00082"/>So what with one thing and another,... and<lb facs="P21_TL00083"/>making due allowance for occasional flukes....<lb facs="P21_TL00084"/>all things seem to conspire to the propogation<lb facs="P21_TL00085"/>of conventionality, and the largest factor is<lb facs="P21_TL00086"/>probably commercialism, the craze of all<lb facs="P21_TL00087"/>" artists " for publicity and large profits; but<lb facs="P21_TL00088"/>as in studying past records of the Drama,<lb facs="P21_TL00089"/>especially in the earlier half of last century,<lb facs="P21_TL00090"/>I have come across various other outcries on<lb facs="P21_TL00091"/>the mortification of the British Drama, I have<lb facs="P21_TL00092"/>no doubt that things might be worse, since<lb facs="P21_TL00093"/>the complaint is no wise new; and with the<lb facs="P21_TL00094"/>vastly greater number of theatres there are<lb facs="P21_TL00095"/>now, the increasing competition, and the<lb facs="P21_TL00096"/>indifference of the public to most things that<lb facs="P21_TL00097"/>should rouse them from indifference, it is<lb facs="P21_TL00098"/>amazing that the standard of work in the<lb facs="P21_TL00099"/>London theatres is as good as it is.<lb facs="P21_TL00100"/>Certainly as a whole it might yet be higher.<lb facs="P21_TL00101"/>That it can hardly be called hasty in concept<lb facs="P21_TL00102"/>tion and careless in performance is fairly<lb facs="P21_TL00103"/>obvious to any who know anything of the<lb facs="P21_TL00104"/>various considerations affecting the British<lb facs="P21_TL00105"/>Drama.

If<lb facs="P21_TL00124"/>one could credit the current reports as to the<lb facs="P21_TL00125"/>badness of the theatrical season it would seem<lb facs="P21_TL00126"/>either that the public is not contented with<lb facs="P21_TL00127"/>what it receives in the theatre, or that some<lb facs="P21_TL00128"/>counter attractions, can the Stadium of the<lb facs="P21_TL00129"/>Franco British Exhibition be one?.... are too<lb facs="P21_TL00130"/>powerful. In the main the general public is,<lb facs="P21_TL00131"/>I think, quite content with what it receives<lb facs="P21_TL00132"/>in the theatre, though perhaps we might<lb facs="P21_TL00133"/>except the programme, for which the public<lb facs="P21_TL00134"/>continues in most theatres to pay sixpence<lb facs="P21_TL00135"/>for the pleasure of reading advertisements of<lb facs="P21_TL00136"/>whisky which is obtainable at an equally high<lb facs="P21_TL00137"/>price, I understand, at most bars.

                                       <lb facs="P22_TL00002"/>as the dramatic fare is concerned the public<lb facs="P22_TL00003"/>appears to be content with what it receives,<lb facs="P22_TL00004"/>though my own opinion is it pays rather too<lb facs="P22_TL00005"/>high a price. For one thing the public nowadays<lb facs="P22_TL00006"/>will take anything that is sufficiently<lb facs="P22_TL00007"/>advertised. But there is not only one public,<lb facs="P22_TL00008"/>or three or four sections, but a dozen or more,<lb facs="P22_TL00009"/>and several overlap. There is the public that<lb facs="P22_TL00010"/>goes to see Beerbohm Tree, another that<lb facs="P22_TL00011"/>goes to see Cyril Maude; another for Lewis<lb facs="P22_TL00012"/>Waller, another for melodrama at the Lyceum;<lb facs="P22_TL00013"/>another for Opera; another for 44 Musical<lb facs="P22_TL00014"/>Comedy"; another for the Music Halls,....<lb facs="P22_TL00015"/>where, by the way, one still gets the best<lb facs="P22_TL00016"/>value for one's money in sheer individual<lb facs="P22_TL00017"/>talent; another for the amateur {and pro«<lb facs="P22_TL00018"/>fessional) entertainments provided on Sunday<lb facs="P22_TL00019"/>by Socialist clubs; oh! and another lor the<lb facs="P22_TL00020"/>works of Mr George Bernard Shaw. The<lb facs="P22_TL00021"/>public for this however, would seldom be<lb facs="P22_TL00022"/>found to overlap with that which goes to<lb facs="P22_TL00023"/>44 Musical Comedy ", though some of it might<lb facs="P22_TL00024"/>be found at a Shakespearean resuscitation<lb facs="P22_TL00025"/>by Mr Beerbohm Tree, or at a Music Hall.<lb facs="P22_TL00026"/>Though perhaps this is doubtful, for the<lb facs="P22_TL00027"/>44 Shavian " audience has quite its own<lb facs="P22_TL00028"/>character; a somewhat vegetable one. But<lb facs="P22_TL00029"/>I do not think the various sections of the<lb facs="P22_TL00030"/>public are divided on the point whether they<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>are 44 content with what they receive in the<lb facs="P22_TL00032"/>theatres". They continue to go to them; if<lb facs="P22_TL00033"/>they were not content they would stay away;<lb facs="P22_TL00034"/>and this, in spite of the talk of a bad theatrical<lb facs="P22_TL00035"/>season, I do not think they have done. It is<lb facs="P22_TL00036"/>in no spirit of bitterness I say: It is mainly<lb facs="P22_TL00037"/>a matter of advertisement. It was some time<lb facs="P22_TL00038"/>before the public began to accept Shaw; it<lb facs="P22_TL00039"/>would be some time probably before they<lb facs="P22_TL00040"/>would accept any new and unusual form of<lb facs="P22_TL00041"/>work. The advertisement may be cumulative,<lb facs="P22_TL00042"/>the effect of years, or it may be sudden and<lb facs="P22_TL00043"/>emphatic; but advertisement there must be<lb facs="P22_TL00044"/>before the public begin to appreciate 44 the<lb facs="P22_TL00045"/>new thing ", whether good or otherwise. The<lb facs="P22_TL00046"/>public seem for the most part rather to lack<lb facs="P22_TL00047"/>confidence in their own judgment and to<lb facs="P22_TL00048"/>require quiet but insistent assertion as to the<lb facs="P22_TL00049"/>value of any work of art. Indeed, were it not for<lb facs="P22_TL00050"/>the often attacked but Iong=&gt;suffering Press,<lb facs="P22_TL00051"/>probably few workers in any sphere of art<lb facs="P22_TL00052"/>could find as ready or as full a recognition</ab>

It is folly to write about the<lb facs="P23_TL00060"/>Art of the artist for without Art he is no<lb facs="P23_TL00061"/>artist. What may be written about is the<lb facs="P23_TL00062"/>athletic quality of his work; bearing in mind<lb facs="P23_TL00063"/>that the athletics of the body and of the soul<lb facs="P23_TL00064"/>are two different things. This is not forgotten<lb facs="P23_TL00065"/>when speaking of the soldier. The arts of<lb facs="P23_TL00066"/>war are rather dangerous things to criticize<lb facs="P23_TL00067"/>though we may be sure that those extraordinary<lb facs="P23_TL00068"/>arts have never been written about in the right<lb facs="P23_TL00069"/>spirit by any critic who was not a poet at the</ab>

What is to<lb facs="P24_TL00022"/>prevent these writers writing? Oh, if you<lb facs="P24_TL00023"/>please, they will only write if they can get<lb facs="P24_TL00024"/>their plays accepted at a theatre. JZ?<lb facs="P24_TL00025"/>So you see it is success and money they aim<lb facs="P24_TL00026"/>at, not the writing of a play. For anybody is<lb facs="P24_TL00027"/>at liberty to write what he likes. But what<lb facs="P24_TL00028"/>Mr Robert Ross in the enthusiasm of the<lb facs="P24_TL00029"/>moment forgets is the awful consequence of<lb facs="P24_TL00030"/>the Censor permitting one of these earnest<lb facs="P24_TL00031"/>writers the liberty he asks. The consequence<lb facs="P24_TL00032"/>would be that a thousand catch=penny writers<lb facs="P24_TL00033"/>who have already got their plays written and<lb facs="P24_TL00034"/>are only waiting for the Censor to give in,<lb facs="P24_TL00035"/>would instantly flood England with these so®<lb facs="P24_TL00036"/>called 44religious" and 44 pyschological" plays<lb facs="P24_TL00037"/>which would be sure to be acted in a way<lb facs="P24_TL00038"/>which would revolt the feelings of the better<lb facs="P24_TL00039"/>section of the public.<lb facs="P24_TL00040"/>The Censor is entirely right if he hold us<lb facs="P24_TL00041"/>harmful to the public the representation of<lb facs="P24_TL00042"/>jealousy, ambition, hatred, meanness, envy,<lb facs="P24_TL00043"/>murder, torture, seduction, riot and all the<lb facs="P24_TL00044"/>other themes which would be seized upon if<lb facs="P24_TL00045"/>the dramatist had the opportunity. It does<lb facs="P24_TL00046"/>not matter whether the play have a good<lb facs="P24_TL00047"/>ending or a bad ending, whether a murderer<lb facs="P24_TL00048"/>succeeds or fails. Remember what Nietzsche<lb facs="P24_TL00049"/>says. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00050"/>44 Stage-morality. — He who believes that<lb facs="P24_TL00051"/>44 Shakespeare's stage has a moral effect and<lb facs="P24_TL00052"/>4&gt; that the sight of Macbeth irresistibly detracts<lb facs="P24_TL00053"/>44from evil ambition is mistaken. And he is aga=<lb facs="P24_TL00054"/>44 in mistaken if he believes that Shakespeare<lb facs="P24_TL00055"/>44 himself was of this opinion. Any man who is<lb facs="P24_TL00056"/>44 really possessed by mad ambition will watch<lb facs="P24_TL00057"/>44 this, his emblem, with delight; and the very<lb facs="P24_TL00058"/>44 fact that the hero perishes in his passion is<lb facs="P24_TL00059"/>44 the strongest charm in the hot cup of this<lb facs="P24_TL00060"/>4&lt; delight. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00061"/>And this of course is what every artist knows.<lb facs="P24_TL00062"/>It is what the preachers do not know. The<lb facs="P24_TL00063"/>people are like savages.

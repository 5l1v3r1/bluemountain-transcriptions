There is not a page in it which is not interesting<lb facs="P3_TL00012"/>and stimulating in a fine way, and many are both ". &amp;<lb facs="P3_TL00013"/>The same journal, referring to The Mask\s championship of the Censor says, " a<lb facs="P3_TL00014"/>writer who takes his side strongly deserves gratitude, whatever his view may be; for<lb facs="P3_TL00015"/>it is only by Sincerity and Courage that the cause of Art can be usefully served."<lb facs="P3_TL00016"/>WESTMINSTER GAZETTE• " The Mask, by the way, is a quite remarkable,<lb facs="P3_TL00017"/>revolutionary magazine, which, unlike any purely theatrical magazine that I can<lb facs="P3_TL00018"/>recollect, is rich in intelligence, eager discussion of theatrical affairs, treating drama<lb facs="P3_TL00019"/>and the stage seriously as great matters of art, and striking fiercely against the idea<lb facs="P3_TL00020"/>that a playhouse should be a mere place of entertainment." This " interesting<lb facs="P3_TL00021"/>magazine is likely to have a great effect upon the drama of the future. There is no<lb facs="P3_TL00022"/>trace of somnolence in The Mask. &amp;?&amp;&amp;&lt;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;?<lb facs="P3_TL00023"/>•<lb facs="P3_TL00024"/>&amp; MORNING POST. •« Among the least expected editorial sallies are a protest<lb facs="P3_TL00025"/>against the stage treatment of religious subjects,... " Salome " is not forgotten....<lb facs="P3_TL00026"/>and the assertion " the censor is not only a blessing, he is a necessity." &amp;<lb facs="P3_TL00027"/>THE SPHERE- The Mask has now reached its fifth number. In the first place<lb facs="P3_TL00028"/>the format is most engaging. It is a nice folio.... printed in a thick black type 011<lb facs="P3_TL00029"/>a rough paper. It contains many delightful woodcuts by Mr Craig of his own and<lb facs="P3_TL00030"/>other's composition.,., strange designs of beautiful simplicity which give new life to<lb facs="P3_TL00031"/>the art of Bewick. As for the literary matter, it is a torrent of ideas. " &lt;£&gt;<lb facs="P3_TL00032"/>&amp; EIVERPOOI/ COURIER. " The Mask is a new " monthly journal of the art of<lb facs="P3_TL00033"/>the theatre ", and if anything were required to prove how deeply the possibilities<lb facs="P3_TL00034"/>of the drama are now impressing some of the most eager and imperative minds in<lb facs="P3_TL00035"/>Europe, the contents and appearance of its first number would provide evidence and<lb facs="P3_TL00036"/>to spare in a manner of the utmost dignity it attempts to " bring before an<lb facs="P3_TL00037"/>intelligent public many ancient and modern aspects of the Theatre's art, which have<lb facs="P3_TL00038"/>been too long disregarded or forgotten," We wish The Mask a longer life than<lb facs="P3_TL00039"/>ambitious periodicals of the kind are generally permitted to enjoy."<lb facs="P3_TL00040"/>"The second number of The Mask has now reached us from its Florentine printing<lb facs="P3_TL00041"/>place, and by the delicacy of its format, the pleasantness and dignity of its types, the<lb facs="P3_TL00042"/>careful excellence with which its illustrations have been reproduced, the character<lb facs="P3_TL00043"/>of the illustrations themselves, and the curious distinction and sincerity of its literary<lb facs="P3_TL00044"/>contents, it seems to prove that the artistic centre of Europe has once again shifted<lb facs="P3_TL00045"/>to Italy.

He was given,<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>unfortunately for him, three months in which to prepare<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>it. Had it been three days, a brilliant and illuminating<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>impression would almost surely have been the result. But<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>with the larger leisure of many weeks he was able to toil<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>to Sieights from which the prospect of his subject could be<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>scanned back to the beginning of tragedy in the Thespian<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>cart of the Attic poet, six hundred years before the Christian<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>era. From this remote period he traced its slow development,<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>till after three solid hours the lecturer sat down with the</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>apology that he had barely reached his subject. Our poet might have taken warning by the<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>prolixity of Polonius, who, to prove Hamlet was mad, went back to the consideration of why<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>44 day was day, " 44 night night," and 44 time was time," till he was bidden to proceed with 44<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>more matter and less art." For, after all, time is time, and it seems to me that if 1 am to<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>release you at all to-day 1 must keep before me this fundamental truth and simplify my<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>address.<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>&amp; At the outset, however, I would pray for indulgence, for never was a task undertaken<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>with greater alacrity or the more heartily repented of at leisure. The consideration of<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>44 Character and the Actor" is as fascinating as the width of the subject is appalling.<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>Pondering upon the matter I become aware that the consideration embraces 44 Character<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>and Art," and on that road where is one to stop?<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>&amp; And yet, that I may present my reflections in order, I must first consider the nature of<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>the art of acting. I take it for granted that acting is an art. I know this has been disputed;<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>never, I think, by a great thinker or of a great actor. I know of no definition of art which<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>is not essentially the definition of great acting. It would be as useless to deny that in much<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>acting there is little art, as there is little art in much painting and sculpture. &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>&amp; Some have been found, it is true, to speak of the art of acting as a sham—Mr. Augustine<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>Birrell, for instance. Well, the words 44 sham \ and 44 imitation " are synonymous, and Mr.<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>Birrell, in his essay on Actors, in choosing the word 44 sham " is doing so purposely to belittle<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>an art, in describing which Shakespeare has, with profound sympathy and understanding,<lb facs="P7_TL00046"/>chosen the word 44 imitation." And I will venture to say that in no way is the character<lb facs="P7_TL00047"/>of a man more surely indicated than by his choice of words. All art is imitation—a<lb facs="P7_TL00048"/>A lecture delivered before the etbological Society, 3rd January 1908.</ab>

God alone creates, man but reveals. My one<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>" effort is to * represent' what I find in God's creation—above all in the form of man, which<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>" is the highest, most perfect of architectural constructions."<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>&amp; If Rodin thinks thus highly of the representations of man's body, what does he think,<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>I wonder, of the representations of man's soul, the province of the actor? Let us seek for<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>a definition of this art of acting from one whose opinion is incontrovertible, from one who<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>lived his life among them, inspired them to their loftiest efforts, the greatest human<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>understanding this world has known—let us seek of Shakespeare himself. &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>&amp; We shall find it—the most luminous definition of the art of acting—in Hamlet's second<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>soliloquy. He says:— "Is it not monstrous that this player here<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>Gould force his soul so to his own conceit<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>That from her working all his visage wanned."<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>Then comes a description of the effect of the actor's art upon the vehicles of his<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>expression. " Tears in his eyes, Distraction in 's aspect." And so on.<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>I doubt whether a more subtle, or a more accurate description of the actor's mental and<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>psychical process at the moment of exercising his art will ever be expressed. &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>How it is possible that an actor can " force his soul so to his own conceit," that tears<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>will spring to his eyes, that, in other words, his physical functions will operate involuntarily,<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>and that his whole function will suit with forms to his conceit, may be even now something<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>of a mystery. But though Shakespeare was not concerned for the moment with this question,<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>he seems almost to have anticipated what may be the reason for the curious mental condition<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>of the actor when imitating Humanity. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>&amp; May I venture to suggest that an explanation of this psychical process may be found in<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>the discoveries of psychic research? The fact that " man is the microcosm of the universe "<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>seems to have received additional proof by the evidence of recent researches in hypnotic<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>suggestion. It seems more and more clear that man is composed of many egos, if I may use<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>the expression, and as in hypnotic suggestion the subject will answer in keeping with an<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>identity of which in its normal condition it is unconscious, so in the exercise of his art by<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>an actor, one off the innumerable egos of which he is composed will live before us, in the<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>person of the artist who has called up one off these separate identities. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>This is the explanation, it seems to me, of the creative element in the actor, this is what<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>Shakespeare calls the " conceit," viz., the conception, what can be born, and to what he<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>realized the actor could force his soul, This, it seems to me, is what, at its noblest<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>and highest, is called inspiration. This is what Garrick speaks of when he says;—<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>" I pronounce that the greatest strokes of genius have been unknown to the actor himself<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>" till circumstances and the warmth of the scene have sprung the mine, as much to his own<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>" surprise as to that of the audience." &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>Sir Henry Irving, I think, has said that an actor, in the exercise of his art, is calling<lb facs="P8_TL00045"/>upon a certain duality of mind, and 1 would venture to go further and to suggest that the<lb facs="P8_TL00046"/>actor is myriad-minded, and that the greater number of egos he can express, and the more<lb facs="P8_TL00047"/>completely he can express the complex nature of each of these egos, the greater actor he is.<lb facs="P8_TL00048"/>" 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus."<lb facs="P8_TL00049"/>The Dramatist would seem to possess the same capacity for sebMdentification with other<lb facs="P8_TL00050"/>beings, and in this light Shakespeare is the greatest of all artists, because he could express<lb facs="P8_TL00051"/>an almost infinite number of egos and so completely that the man Shakespeare himself can<lb facs="P8_TL00052"/>only be found by inference.<lb facs="P8_TL00053"/>&amp; When a great actor performs a part, he is the man he represents: it is not a question<lb facs="P8_TL00054"/>of pretence, of assumption, of sham, of mimicry, it is one of his many egos, one of his own<lb facs="P8_TL00055"/>creatures, which is speaking. I say " creature," for observe, ladies and gentlemen, Shakespeare<lb facs="P8_TL00056"/>allows to the actor the power to create. &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00057"/>&amp; " Is it not monstrous that this player.... could force his soul so to his own conceit."<lb facs="P8_TL00058"/>&amp; Now observe another point in his definition, strikingly precise. " Force his soul"—not<lb facs="P8_TL00059"/>his mind—his soul. His mind is not forced, that is calm, alert, critical, intent upon the<lb facs="P8_TL00060"/>expression of his soul, intent upon the means he is using, upon his audience, upon the effect</ab>

That is Shakespeare's definition<lb facs="P9_TL00005"/>of the art of acting, and in the light of this brilliant illumination upon the subject w© may<lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>disregard the poor little glimmer of Mr. Augustine Birrell's pronouncement, when he says,<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>" The art of acting is the art of mimicry, or the representation of feigned emotions called<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>up by sham situations." Such a little flicker of light upon the subject as this, is only<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>sufficient to make Mr. Birrell's own right honourable darkness visible.<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>&amp; Those who had the privilege of hearing Mr. Walkley's address on " Some aspects of the<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>Modern Stage," will call to mind that he referred to the actor as " something less than a<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>man "—whatever such a nebulous description as that may mean—and found that there was<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>" something unmanly in the actor's making capital out of his physical advantages." That<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>Mr. Birrell should betray strange ignorance on a question of Dramatic art is not surprising,<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>but that Mr. Walkley, who nightly sits in judgment upon plays and actors, should plumb a<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>lower depth of Philistinism even than Mr. Birrell, gives one furiously to think. During what<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>" brain=storm " did Mr. Walkley utter this nonsense? What physical advantages did they<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>possess which made such unmanly creatures of Kean, of Garrick, of Robson, of Burbage, of<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>Betterton, of Dillon? If physical advantage enter into the question at all, and the great<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>French actor, Le Kain, does not even mention this as a requisite for the actor, the eminence<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>which these men attained is a direct proof that physical advantages are not the actor's capital,<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>for they triumphed in spite of the fact that they possessed none. The veriest tyro of<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>theatrical history knows that most of the great men and great women have succeeded on<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>the stage, in spite of their lack of physical advantages. But if they had possessed physical<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>advantages why would it have been unmanly to use them? If this infantile argument held<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>good, the " heavenly choir" of an Adelina Patti would be a subject for scorn, and the<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>thunders of Demosthenes himself would have been unmanly, because he used the physical<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>advantage of the voice which God had given him. &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>&amp; Such arguments as those of Mr. Walkley and Mr. Birrell would not justify the time spent<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>on their serious consideration were it not for this danger, that the unthinking may accept<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>such statements seriously, coming from men who may conceivably carry some authority.<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>The wisdom and the wide tolerance of the generation we have the good fortune to live<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>in have made it superfluous to defend either actors or their art. But occasionally, I take<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>it, an actor is justified in trying to explain something of the mysteries of his art, lest the<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>" dicta " of such gentlemen as I have referred to come to be accepted by the unreflecting.<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>If we cannot think for ourselves let us at least adopt the conclusions of great original<lb facs="P9_TL00037"/>thinkers, and on the subject of the art of acting, let us adopt the conclusions of the world,<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>rather than those of the chief Secretary for Ireland. In a word, let us accept Shakespeare's<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>definition of the art of acting and proceed. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>&amp; Now, what of the actor himself? Can we speak of the actor himself? Which of these<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>innumerable egos are we to speak of? We see the character which Shakespeare has created,<lb facs="P9_TL00042"/>but where is the man Shakespeare himself? You will find him in his work, in his artistic<lb facs="P9_TL00043"/>selection, in the theme of his tragedies, in the motive of his comedies. In a word, you will<lb facs="P9_TL00044"/>find the man in his art. And there, too, you will find the actor. You will find the man<lb facs="P9_TL00045"/>behind the actor in the guiding intelligence, the critical faculty, the artistic point of view,<lb facs="P9_TL00046"/>and that aspect of his own personal character which he brings to bear on his interpretations.<lb facs="P9_TL00047"/>Now an actor is called upon, or his own idiosyncrasy impels him, to interpret a variety<lb facs="P9_TL00048"/>of beings, noble and ignoble. Do these interpretations affect the actor's character? That<lb facs="P9_TL00049"/>depends, it seems to me, upon the strength of his own personal character. &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00050"/>£&gt; Is his character tarnished by the exhibition of the ignoble, the unworthy? Not necessarily,<lb facs="P9_TL00051"/>not even, I think, frequently.<lb facs="P9_TL00052"/>&amp; Let us look for a moment at the worst period of the Restoration. It is astonishing that<lb facs="P9_TL00053"/>through this morass of immorality any human being could walk unblemished; yet several<lb facs="P9_TL00054"/>examples of private worth at once spring forward among the interpreters of that incredibly<lb facs="P9_TL00055"/>corrupt Drama which the morals of the period brought forth—Betterton, Mistress Bracegirdle,<lb facs="P9_TL00056"/>Mistress Saunderson, who later became Mistress Betterton. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00057"/>&amp; Says Mr. Clark Russell in his "Representative Actors —"It is almost impossible to<lb facs="P9_TL00058"/>44 believe that any woman could have been found to publicly pronounce some of the language</ab>

Yet among the actresses in these<lb facs="P10_TL00003"/>44 and even worst dramas the reputations of some have been handed down to us as<lb facs="P10_TL00004"/>44 unimpeachable. Such was Mistress Betterton, such was Mistress Bracegirdle. Later on,<lb facs="P10_TL00005"/>44 when the licensing of plays cante in vogue, a fine was levied upon any actor or actress<lb facs="P10_TL00006"/>44 giving utterance to an immoral sentence. Among the first who were mulcted for this<lb facs="P10_TL00007"/>44 offence were Betterton and Mistress Bracegirdle." &amp;<lb facs="P10_TL00008"/>Betterton! for fifty-one years the pride of the English Theatre, a man who 44 off the stage,<lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>was/* says an article in the 44 Cornhil!

The venerable representative of all that was most honourable in the drama<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>of his day, fined for giving voice to the immorality of a play of Dryden's, yet whose private<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>worth was so little affected thereby, that Addison could say, that the name of 44 Betterton<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>ought to be recorded with the same respect as Roscius among the Romans," and whose bones<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>were laid to rest by a grateful country in the Abbey at Westminster. &amp;<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>Mistress Betterton! the mouthpiece of the indecencies of Nat Lee and Congreve, yet of<lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>whom Colley Gibber could write:— 44 She was the faithful companion of her husband and his<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>fellow labourer for five and forty years, and was a woman of unblemished and sober life."<lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>jgr Mistress Bracegirdle! that 44 Diana of the stage," as Dr. Doran calls her, and of whom<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>he gives us this delightful thumbnail sketch. Says he :— .£?&amp;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>&amp; 44 Before Mistress Bracegirdle, Congreve and Lord Lovelace, at the head of a troop of<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>44 bodkined fops, worshipped in vain. The noblest of the troop, and it reckoned the Dukes<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>44 of Devonshire and the Earl of Halifax, were wont at the coffeehouse and over a bottle, to<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>44 extol the Gibraltar-dike virtue, if I may so speak, of this incomparable woman. 4 Come,'<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>44 said Halifax, 4 you are always praising the virtue, why don't you reward the lady who will<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>44 not sell it? 1 propose a subscription, and there are 200 guineas pour encourager les<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>44 autresFour times that amount was raised, and with it the nobles, with their swords in<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>44 their hands, waited on Mistress Bracegirdle, who accepted their testimonial, as it was<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>44 intended, in honour of her virtue. 1 will only add that had Mistress Bracegirdle been<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>44 rewarded for her charity, the recompense would have been at least as appropriate. For<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>44 it is true of her, that when the poor saw her, they blessed her, and we may add, she richly<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>44 merited their well-earned benedictions."<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>Thus Dr. Doran. And so little was the private character of this lady injured by uttering<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>the gross indecencies of the Restoration Drama that Dibden declares her name was always<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>mentioned with 44 great respect, both on account of her public merit and her private virtues."<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>Of the rank and file of the Restoration actors and actresses we naturally know less<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>than of the conspicuous and representative example I have mentioned, but it is obvious that<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>in spite of the degrading material in which they worked, their characters might emerge<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>spotless. How was this possible? I venture to suggest that either the Ego which spoke in<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>these interpretations, was constantly controlled by the superior strength of their own<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>personal character, or that the 44 Dramatis Personse " of the Restoration Drama had no capacity<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>to receive the breath of life which an actor can bestow upon them. That therefore the Ego<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>was not called upon to live, and that those mere puppets of an hour required nothing more<lb facs="P10_TL00044"/>than the voice and gesture of an actor to give them that slight semblance of reality which<lb facs="P10_TL00045"/>was necessary. For we must remember that the fame of Betterton rests, not on such pup<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

S. Willard also acquired a decade or so later. Can it be<lb facs="P10_TL00051"/>contended that the daily interpretation of passions which disgrace humanity, affected the<lb facs="P10_TL00052"/>moral fibre of either of these gentlemen? Surely not. I think we may safely conclude that<lb facs="P10_TL00053"/>the character of the actor or the actress is not necessarily degraded by the interpretation<lb facs="P10_TL00054"/>or voicing of what is unworthy.<lb facs="P10_TL00055"/>And what of the other side of the question? Does the constant illustration of all that is<lb facs="P10_TL00056"/>noble, tolerant, charitable and high-minded, help to refine and to elevate the character of<lb facs="P10_TL00057"/>the illustrator?

It<lb facs="P11_TL00003"/>is the character of the man behind the actor which is the determining factor. A man of<lb facs="P11_TL00004"/>intrinsic or acquired high-mindedness and honesty can come scatheless through work which<lb facs="P11_TL00005"/>may be degrading, and may add to his own beauty of character by contact with what is noble.<lb facs="P11_TL00006"/>I am aware that to many enlightened minds, it would appear superfluous to assert this,<lb facs="P11_TL00007"/>but I would ask any such to consider that there may still be found those who, from love of<lb facs="P11_TL00008"/>advertisement, from motives of envy and Jealousy misrepresent the influence upon the actor<lb facs="P11_TL00009"/>of the exercise of his art.<lb facs="P11_TL00010"/>&amp; It is with this consideration in view that I would to your remembrance one of the<lb facs="P11_TL00011"/>most remarkable instances of the steady development of character side by side with the<lb facs="P11_TL00012"/>steady prosecution of the art of acting. I refer to Shakespeare himself. It does not seem to<lb facs="P11_TL00013"/>have been widely realised, until Mr. Sidney Lee pointed it out, that Shakespeare 44 remained<lb facs="P11_TL00014"/>a prominent member of the actors' profession till near the end of his life." Of the parts<lb facs="P11_TL00015"/>he played we have only scanty knowledge, though we have reason to believe they were<lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>important. I cannot do better than quote Mr. Sidney Lee's words:— &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>44 That Shakespeare chafed under some of the conditions of the actors' calling is commonly<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>" inferred from the 'Sonnets.' There he reproaches himself with becoming * a motley to the<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>44 view,' and chides fortune for having provided for Ms livelihood nothing better than 4 public<lb facs="P11_TL00020"/>44 means that public manners breed,' whence his name received a brand. If such self-pity is to<lb facs="P11_TL00021"/>44 be literally interpreted, it only reflected an evanescent mood. His interest in all that<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>44 touched the efficiency of his profession was permanently active. His highest ambitions lay,<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>44 it is true, elsewhere than in acting, and at an early period of hjs theatrical career he<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>44 undertook, with triumphant success, the labours of a playwright. But he pursued the<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>44 profession of an actor loyally and uninterruptedly until he resigned all connection with<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>44 the theatres within a few years of his death. "<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>&lt;£? And to digress, perhaps, a little, we may say: 44 How well he knew them!" Their<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>faults, their weaknesses, their powers of imagination, their humour, their complex and<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>difficult art. Is there one word of scorn for his calling—with the exception of this one<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>passage Mr. Sidney Lee quotes from the sonnets? that, too, written when a young man—and<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>the meaning of which is still disputed. One word of scorn for his fellow-members of that<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>calling, through whose medium his creatures were to be re-animated with the gift of 44 form<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>and moving " ? Not one, I think. Shakespeare's references to his fellow actors are always<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>made with the tenderness and charity of true knowledge and actual experience. And yet<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>how he must have suffered at their hands! The members of the Globe Theatre Company<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>were not all Burbages, Alleynes or Hemminges.

What inevitable<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>heart-burnings must there have been among his company, as each fresh play was cast.<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>What was said when the author, himself a fellowplayer, was announced to appear as the<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>Ghost in 44 Hamlet"? In spite of it all, how deeply he must have been beloved by his associates,<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>when Hemming© and Condell, his fellow actors, seven years after his death, brought together<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>his precious manuscripts for publication; not for pecuniary gain, scarcely it would seem<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>with a full understanding of the genius of the poet, but in the enthusiasm of their love for<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>their dead comrade. What is the uppermost thought in their minds? What are the words<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>of their dedication? 44 To keepe the memory of so worthy a Friend and Fellow alive, as was<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>our Shakespeare." Nor did Shakespeare, In his will, forget his old comrades in art. 44 To<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>each of his 4 fellows ' John Hemminge, Richard Burbage and Henry Condell, he leaves twenty<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Here was the greatest creative<lb facs="P11_TL00050"/>artist that ever lived, not only maturing his stupendous powers as a dramatist, living in<lb facs="P11_TL00051"/>beloved, and loving comradeship with his fellow-actors, 44 pursuing," as Mr. Sidney Lee says,<lb facs="P11_TL00052"/>44 the profession of an actor loyally and uninterruptedly," but at the same time developing<lb facs="P11_TL00053"/>his own character. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00054"/>&amp; Says Professor Dowden in his subtle and fascinating work, 44 Shakespeare, his mind and<lb facs="P11_TL00055"/>art":— 44 It is clearly ascertainable from his plays and poems that Shakespeare's will grew<lb facs="P11_TL00056"/>with advancing age, beyond measure, calmer and more strong." In other words, Shakespeare<lb facs="P11_TL00057"/>was gaining that 44 captaincy of the soul " which the dramatic critic of 44 The Times " has<lb facs="P11_TL00058"/>affirmed is what a man must necessarily lose in the exercise of an actor's calling.</ab>

Reflections<lb facs="P12_TL00008"/>sketchy and immature, I greatly fear. I would call them suggestions rather than conclusions.<lb facs="P12_TL00009"/>Suggestions which may lead perhaps other and more capable students to enlarge upon, and<lb facs="P12_TL00010"/>may I venture to propose a subject to Shakespearian scholars—a subject hitherto almost<lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>disregarded, viz., "Shakespeare, the actor?" It seems curious that this side of Shakespeare's<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>life should not have invited more consideration and research. Might I venture to hope that<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>Mr. Sidney Lee, who has touched upon the subject in his delightful biography, will, some<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>day, greatly enlarge our knowledge of this side of Shakespeare's life; all important, it seems<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>to me, when we consider the fact that the practice of his profession as an actor must have<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>absorbed by far the greater portion of his days, and that his character and outlook upon<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>life were developing in the midst of daily devotion to this calling. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>And now I would dwell for a little upon the question—To what extent is acting affected<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>by character? 1 am not sure that such poor reflections as I will try to express do not<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>equally apply to character and all art. I find myself continually seeking illustrations from the<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>arts of painting, sculpture and dramatic literature. <lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>The conviction I would like to impart is of greater importance than art. It is m &gt;re<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>important to the world at large. I feel it is more important even to the artist himself. £?<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>It seems to me a right instinct which urges people to seek for the man behind the artist.<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>Is the instinct which urges people to accept charily the artist who works alone for art's<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>sake, also right? Perhaps it is. jg?<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>&amp; At the moment when man began to express himself through a piece of work, art began,<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>and in recognising a work of art, we recognise the mind and character of the man who<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>wrought it. And that mind and character is never stationary. It is either developing or<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>deteriorating. I might venture the suggestion that at the moment that art is practised solely<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>for the sake of art, decadence has set in, decadence of character, and hence, it seems to<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>me, of art. There seems a subtle truth in Eleonora Duse's words, when she says:—<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>&amp; " If the sight of the blue skies fills you with joy, if a blade of grass springing up in the<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>" fields has power to move you, rejoice, for your soul is alive; and then aspire to learn that<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>" other truth—that the least of what you receive can be divided. To help and share—that is<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>"the sum of all knowledge, that is the meaning of &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>Now, the artist who practises art for art's sake does not share with humanity at large.<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>He is apt to keep his point of view and his sense of beauty to himself, or to share only<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>with a few equally exclusive fellow-artists. &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>" The Herd," as humanity at large is so often referred to by these elect, are scorned,<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>and it seems to me that the really great artists love humanity and do not scorn it.<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>jgr A similar companionship was that old Bohemianism which, in addition to being a<lb facs="P12_TL00043"/>comradeship in artistic endeavour was largely a protest against, and a defiance of the realities<lb facs="P12_TL00044"/>of daily life. Such defiance one may be excused for taking to be an indication of some<lb facs="P12_TL00045"/>weakness in the character. I think he is a stronger man who can admit the claims of fact<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>while practising the imitation of nature or humanity, than he who dodges a dun in a ecstatic<lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>disregard of his duties as a simple citizen. The most incorrigible Bohemian, the most<lb facs="P12_TL00048"/>precious and exclusive in the Brotherhood of the Elect, might well reflect, perhaps, that<lb facs="P12_TL00049"/>while Shakespeare was projecting the greatest tragedies in literature, he was also suing<lb facs="P12_TL00050"/>Philip Rogers, at Stratford=on»Avon, for L i 9s. iod., due to him for malt supplied.<lb facs="P12_TL00051"/>I would again return to Professor Dowden's reference to the development of Shakespeare's<lb facs="P12_TL00052"/>mind and art in comparison with that of his early contemporaries, Marlowe and Green.<lb facs="P12_TL00053"/>Calling our attention to the reckless Bohemianism of the last-named ill-balanced but brilliant<lb facs="P12_TL00054"/>Dramatic artists, he says:— "It must have appeared to Shakespeare (who well understood<lb facs="P12_TL00055"/>" honest frolic) a poor affair, a flimsy kind of idealism—this reckless knocking of a man's<lb facs="P12_TL00056"/>" head against the solid laws of the universe. The protest against our subjections to law<lb facs="P12_TL00057"/>" made by such men as Marlowe and Green, was a vulgar and superficial protest."<lb facs="P12_TL00058"/>&amp; What was the end of the Bohemian Marlowe? An ignominious death in a tavern brawl—<lb facs="P12_TL00059"/>that of the greater artist, who had won the captaincy of his soul, through that noble<lb facs="P12_TL00060"/>development of his mind and art " which was based on a resolute fidelity to the</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P13_TL00002"/>facts of life," an honoured retirement upon his estate at Stratford - on-Avon.<lb facs="P13_TL00003"/>And I will venture to say that the cultivation of the character is of more consequence<lb facs="P13_TL00004"/>to the actor than to any other artist. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00005"/>The loss of character is the loss of self®discipline, and the actor's self-discipline is more<lb facs="P13_TL00006"/>tried than in any other art. The poet in his retreat, the sculptor and the artist in the<lb facs="P13_TL00007"/>quiet of their studios, know nothing of the difficulties of performing their work amidst the<lb facs="P13_TL00008"/>distractions of that busy hive of activity, the modern theatre. The very irritability which<lb facs="P13_TL00009"/>is a necessary condition of an actor's nervous system, renders him doubly susceptible to the<lb facs="P13_TL00010"/>loss of his self-restraint. The very applause of an audience night after night, tests his sense of<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>proportion, and makes it trebly difficult but trebly important that he should discipline his<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>emotions and control his highly®wrought nervous organisation. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>&amp; That " Imitation of Humanity," which Shakespeare describes as the actor's art is a constant<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>assault upon a due recognition of the " solid laws of the universe ". The imitation of humanity<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>may so easily become confused with the facts of humanity, that he may lose that sanity of<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>mind, without which his character cannot develop. In the Sight of his cherished imitation<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>of Macbeth the butcher's bill may easily become a prosaic and negligible quantity. The<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>power to imitate humanity—that art which Voltaire has described as the most difficult of<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>all arts—must be balanced with a knowledge and an understanding of the facts of actual<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>daily life. Without this balance the character deteriorates, and thus, slowly but certainly,<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>the deterioration is visible in his work, and the end is reached in bitterness and<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>blind conflict with those very imperturbable facts which he has ignored or defied.<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>*£? The artist's fate is in his own hands. There is nothing in the imitation of humanity or<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>nature which brings inevitable deterioration, &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>&amp; Betterton went further and thought a strict preparatory discipline of the character before<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>adopting the stage as a profession was essential. For, he says, "there is no manner of doubt<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>" but that the lives and Characters of those Persons, who are the Vehicles, as I may call them,<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>" of these Instructions must contribute very much to the impression the Fable and Mora! will<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>" make. For to hear Virtue, Religion, Honour, recommended by a Sinner, an Atheist, or a<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>" Rake, makes them a Jest to many People, who would hear the same done with Awe by<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>" Persons of known Reputation in those Particulars." <lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>Such preparation of his mental state, as this of Betterton's, when he was to become<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>the interpreter of a great character, is not unusual. It is not, I hope, unbecoming in me<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>to speak of a very remarkable instance of such mental, I may almost say spiritual, preparation.<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>&amp; When Sir Henry Irving played " Hamlet," he deliberately lived the life almost of an<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>anchorite. So solemn a charge he held his interpretation, so essential did he consider the<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>fine poise of his spirit while being the medium of so great a creation, that throughout the<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>run of the Shakesperian tragedy at the Lyceum Theatre, he purposely refrained from<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>indulging in any social distractions, or allowing his mental equilibrium to be disturbed from<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>a sweet serenity and a continual self-restraint, jg? &lt;£?<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>&amp; Here is a picture on the reverse side. An actor was to make his appearance in a role<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>of not less importance than " Hamlet," The night came, the theatre was only half filled,<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>and many of the critics were so little interested, that their seats were empty or occupied<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>only during a portion of the evening. The actor's pride was wounded, the empty seats galled<lb facs="P13_TL00045"/>him, a taint of irritability and defiance grew through his representation, he lost his self®<lb facs="P13_TL00046"/>restraint, and he failed. Not, I take it, that he did not understand his creature, but a lower<lb facs="P13_TL00047"/>side of his own nature gradually obtruded itself, and stained the fine qualities of the noble<lb facs="P13_TL00048"/>creature he was representing. &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00049"/>&amp; To those artists who have not realised the necessity of developing their own character,<lb facs="P13_TL00050"/>in order that it may speak through their work, how inexplicable, how heart=breaking it<lb facs="P13_TL00051"/>must be, when they find that the practice of their art has carried them to a certain point<lb facs="P13_TL00052"/>and never further. In spite of perfect technique, great intelligence, long experience, physical<lb facs="P13_TL00053"/>endowment, their audiences are unmoved; while another artist, with these qualifications<lb facs="P13_TL00054"/>possessed only to a limited extent, will enter profoundly into their affections—and why?<lb facs="P13_TL00055"/>For ever and ever, it seems to me, the same reason. This one possesses already, or has<lb facs="P13_TL00056"/>achieved by the development of character, sympathy, and love of humanity, while to the<lb facs="P13_TL00057"/>other, humanity has been an object of scorn. It is the character of the actor which is<lb facs="P13_TL00058"/>speaking in his interpretations. As Duse has said:— &amp;&lt;£?&amp;&amp;&amp;</ab>

He said there were three. First, Construction—Second, Construction-<lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>Third, Construction! Then I would say of the essentials for the building up of an actor that<lb facs="P14_TL00009"/>they are Character, Character, Character! &amp; jg? &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00010"/>Yes, it seems to me that it is a right instinct which urg ;s us to seek the man in his<lb facs="P14_TL00011"/>work. According to our discovery do we place him in our hearts and affections, or in our<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>intelligence, and no one can doubt that it was the heart and the affection of the nation<lb facs="P14_TL00013"/>which spoke, when it demanded that Sir Henry Irving should be laid to rest in the Abbey<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>at Westminster.<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>I know, of course, that many actors of genius, possessed, too, of great qualities of heart,<lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>do not repose in Westminster Abbey—that their end was obscure, unhonoured. Why?<lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>Because the unthinking world has sometimes spoken slightingly of a life devoted to Art?<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>Never! Because of the medium in which they worked? Never! But because in the sad<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>instances I have in my mind, for reasons into which it were only painful to inquire, they<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>had step by step lost that " captaincy of the soul," by vices acquired or of the blood which<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>finally left them 44 lagging superfluous." Because, in a word, their characters had deteriorated.<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>The train of thought which this consideration opens up covers too vast a field for me<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>to pursue, I only touch upon it to enforce my conviction that the actor in imitating Humanity<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>is largely dominated by one of his many egos, and that he, in turn, must acquire the force<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>of character to keep in subjection the worse or ignoble traits of these egos. Let us follow<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>the advice of old Cronus to his son, 44 My boy, paint what you see, but if it is only a pigsty,<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>dignify it." And as we hang the picture of the pigsty on our walls and look at it with ever<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>fresh delight, let us remember that the work of art gives us Joy because we see the character<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>of the man behind the art, who has purposely selected the beautiful side of his subject and<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>disregarded the base. &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>&amp; The power of an actor of well=disciplined character over his audience is immense; that<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>power, as Sir Theodore Martin has said, is "divine in its origin." May I quote .another<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>eloquent passage from the same brilliant and rarely endowed critic;— &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>"The power of his genius, which has been reflected to him in the palpable emotion or<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>" ringing plaudits of his audience, has opened up to them a world of poetry and emotion, which,<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>" but for him, they would never have known. His 6so potent art' has awakened them to a<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>" knowledge of their own hearts, 4 shown them noble lights in their own soul.' It has lifted<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>44 them for a time above the commonplace of their daily life; it has widened the sphere of<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>44 their sympathies, flashed light upon the conceptions of the greatest poets which has made<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>44 them living realities, and in doing this, it has communicated impulses which may exercise<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>44 a lasting influence for good on the lives of thousands. Not in vain has he lived, who owes<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>44 such success to having wrought with a pure aim to turn to the highest account the<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>special gift of genius."<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>If ever there was an actor to whom these eloquent words could apply it is to my great<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>master, Sir Henry Irving. Never, perhaps, was there an actor whose character, one felt<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>instinctively, was more highly and nobly developed through his art. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>&amp; Ladies and gentlemen, I was for fifteen years under him, and was never nearer to him,<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>in one sense, than the veriest boy in the gallery of his theatre. There was something<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>enigmatical, mysterious and baffling about him. But it was because, through his art, I was<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>unconsciously brought face to face with his soul, his great, enduring, steadfast soul, that<lb facs="P14_TL00051"/>I adored him. It was for the same reason that the English people adored him, and it is for<lb facs="P14_TL00052"/>his steadfast soul, rather than his rare accomplishments, that his name will be imperishable.<lb facs="P14_TL00053"/>If our Saviour has sometimes puzzled us because, during His ministry on this earth, He<lb facs="P14_TL00054"/>said nothing about art, we may be sure that it was not because He ignored the supreme<lb facs="P14_TL00055"/>importance of Art in our daily life; but because His first care was for the character and He<lb facs="P14_TL00056"/>must have known that if the character is noble, noble Art will follow. &amp; &amp;</ab>

Some of the old-fashioned theatres presenting<lb facs="P15_TL00006"/>pieces in the traditional manner are good. These theatres<lb facs="P15_TL00007"/>believe in the old-fashioned way of acting, that is to say, the<lb facs="P15_TL00008"/>actors deliver their lines grandiloquently or simply, but never<lb facs="P15_TL00009"/>insigniflcently.

                                    <lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>theatre also has energy, and in so far as it possesses this energy it deserves unqualified<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>praise. It does not go to sleep: it may be described as a wide-awake theatre. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>&amp; What a pity it is that this activity of the Moderne theatre in Berlin is not able to produce<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>anything resembling a work of art; for the truth is that the Moderne theatre is without<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>great actors, without what may be called sumptuous productions. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>&amp; Added to this, the Moderne theatre is anything but original: it poses as being " original ".<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>It derives its ideas from foreign lands, it makes a poor copy of these ideas, and it serves<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>these ideas up to the public for the most part as though they were its own. in one or two<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>instances it has acknowledged the source of these ideas, which it fondly belives it has annexed<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>and improved on, although it is obvious to anyone of artistic feeling that the copy is as<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>poor as copies generally are.<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>&amp; Now the theatre which offends most in the way I have described is the Deutches Theater<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>in Berlin. First, it derives its ideas entirely from foreign countries, from Russia and England.<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>Secondly, it presents these ideas in a tasteless way. Thirdly, although it possesses many<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>very capable actors it possesses no great actor or actress. Fourthly, its productions may be<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>described as the opposite of sumptuous. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>&amp; Now let us consider these points one by one. &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>Its most grave offence is its lack of originality and therefore of inspiration. As with all<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>imitations, the productions at the Deutches Theater lack fire. They seem but faint echoes of<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>something else. They may be good enough for the good folk in Berlin, who perhaps do not know<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>the difference between the beauty of an original and the emptiness of a copy, but it will<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>not do for other lands where the critics have informed themselves as to the originators of<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>the ideas presented. The critic, on seeing a realistic performance at the Deutches Theater<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>knows that it has been derived from the art theatre in Moscow of which Mr Stanislowsky is<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>the head, and on seeing a performance of a poetic play they will know that the ideas have<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>been derived from Mr Gordon Craig of England. &lt;£? &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>Now this is not merely a chance statement, for the director of the Deutches Theater has<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>himself admitted as much. Upon the production of the " Winter's Tale "in Berlin the director,<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>Herr Reinhardt, was heard to say that at last they had been able to produce a play in just<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>the same way as Mr Craig is famous for. The statement, not very creditable to the<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>Deutches Theater, was made in a triumphant tone, Mr Craig having refused to produce<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>anything at this theatre, although he was invited five times to produce different plays<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>there. Mr. Craig was asked to produce "The Tempest," "Caesar and Cleopatra" by Bernad Shaw,<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>"King Lear," the "Orestaiea," "Macbeth," and in two cases the management even went so far<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>as to send him the contract. But the conditions imposed by a management preferring bad taste<lb facs="P15_TL00053"/>to distinction always prevented him from being able to respond to them. And so the manager,<lb facs="P15_TL00054"/>after having visited Mr Craig's studio with artist friends and carefully studied his work,<lb facs="P15_TL00055"/>goes back and commissions one of these artists who had visited the studio with him to make<lb facs="P15_TL00056"/>some imitations of Mr Craig's work. Although this was the first time the manager<lb facs="P15_TL00057"/>acknowledged " borrowing ", ....to call it by a nice name.... this was not the first time the<lb facs="P15_TL00058"/>imitation had been made. The first time was in " Salome when Mr Craig's earliest work<lb facs="P15_TL00059"/>was imitated. Later on it was " Twelfth Night</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00004"/>&amp; Now the curious part of all this is that with the Germans there is an idea that if a man<lb facs="P16_TL00005"/>invents something it is public property and may be copied by any one, no matter how<lb facs="P16_TL00006"/>badly. The only actual harm it does is to the nation which indulges in this license. It prevents<lb facs="P16_TL00007"/>it from ever exercising its own imagination. Its work therefore becomes stodgy rather than<lb facs="P16_TL00008"/>athletic, Still, as I have said before, this reveals an energy which is rare in most other<lb facs="P16_TL00009"/>lands.<lb facs="P16_TL00010"/>The most famous German imitation of the methods employed by the Russians in their<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>staging of a realistic play, is in the case of 44 Nachtasyla rather poor example being the<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>manner in which " Frishlings Erwachen " was produced. When this Russian theatrical company<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>visited Berlin with their whole productions one might have supposed that the Germans<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>would have been abashed. Not at all, They were heard saying, 44 We did this before or<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>44 You see we have the same ideas ". But the critic, that is to say, one who is not hasty in<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>his judgments, will see all the difference between the production by Mr Stanislowsky of a<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>realistic play and one by the Deutches Theater. &amp; <lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>Perhaps the most vulgar production which is to be laid to the account of the Deutches<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>Theater is that of the 44 Merchant of Venice ". This production is nothing short of dreadful;<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>and for the following reasons. It is a jumble of cheap realism and sentimentality, for poetry<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>gone to seed is sentimentality. They tried to turn this masterpiece, with its wonderful<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>music and poetry, into an up=to=date bit of fun. Thus all the poetry of the lines was lost,<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>all the poetry of movement lost, all the poetry of of diction lost, all the poetry of scene<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>lost and all the poetry of feeling lost. <lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>&amp; We have the old and traditionally fine actor, Schildkraut, as Shylock: we see him battling<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>against these terrible odds. Here and there he produces for 11s the old feeling of the play,<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>which the management is all the time trying to destroy. What can be thought of a<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>production of this play where the actors are told to create an impression of realism by<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>gabbling their lines as though they were at the street corner down in some disreputable<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>neighbourhood in the Bowery? The men all smack each other on the back just as if they<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>were going to say, 44 What's yours, old chap? or 44 Mine's a whisky and soda ". And, mind<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>you, this includes Bassanio, Graziano, Lorenzo and all the distinguished gallants of the<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>peerless imagination of Shakespeare 1... !... Horribie!<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>&amp; Then we have Portia, and a train of girls giggling and smirking about the different<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>suitors who are coming to woo Portia. Instead of the lady of Belmont, that extraordinary<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>creation of Shakespeare, we have a not very distinguished shop girl surrounded by her<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>companions. They deliver their lines about the approach of the suitors just as any bevy of<lb facs="P16_TL00038"/>ill=bred girls would giggle, 44 Ow, 'ere 'e comes! Ow, I sy! Don't be so silly! Go on!" And<lb facs="P16_TL00039"/>this is no exaggeration. Anything more vulgar than the young people in this play is impossible<lb facs="P16_TL00040"/>to conceive. May it is what the management calls 44 making the thing vivacious". No<lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>French management would have been guilty of such a sin against good taste. It revealed<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>in a flash, the class of mind which directs the performances of the theatre. The suitors<lb facs="P16_TL00043"/>the Prince of Morocco and Bassanio, when they arrived, justified the behaviour of these<lb facs="P16_TL00044"/>girls. It was like a lottery in which a woman was the prize. That is not the<lb facs="P16_TL00045"/>impression which Henry Irving created when he produced the play; nor Mr Daly nor Mr<lb facs="P16_TL00046"/>Beerbohm Tree. Neither was it the impression which should be produced. &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00047"/>The court of justice was another parody. That amazing scene, which America and England<lb facs="P16_TL00048"/>witnessed in its perfection when presented by Henry Irving and his company was made<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>ludicrous and common. In vain did Shylock attempt to bring seriousness into the<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>representation. The management were determined to turn it into a farce. Thus we have<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>Portia with a beard and moustache, strutting about like a very small turkey cock, and a<lb facs="P16_TL00052"/>row of fool'sh looking senators all shaking their heads about nothing, and a rowdy lot of<lb facs="P16_TL00053"/>Germans pretending to be distinguished Italians of the 16th century, but shouting and<lb facs="P16_TL00054"/>gesticulating as though they were on a field of battle delivering orders. Shakespeare,<lb facs="P16_TL00055"/>who had drawn either a Jew who was fierce or a Jew who was much wronged, had in this<lb facs="P16_TL00056"/>theatre to put up with a Jew who was a fool, for none but a fool would associate with a<lb facs="P16_TL00057"/>rowdy crew of irresponsible young men and misses as this Jew was made to do.<lb facs="P16_TL00058"/>I can only think that their reason for doing this, was, that they thought they were treating<lb facs="P16_TL00059"/>it in a 44 realistic " manner, which of course is not the right treatment. And even here we<lb facs="P16_TL00060"/>should not have minded so much if the Shylock or the Portia had been interpreted by a</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00002"/>superlatively great actor or actress. But this was not the case: neither would it have been<lb facs="P17_TL00003"/>possible for a great actor to prove his quality in such surroundings. Herr Schildkraut<lb facs="P17_TL00004"/>not being the manager of the theatre was handicapped by the stage manager. In any other<lb facs="P17_TL00005"/>theatre his performance would have been valued and all else would have given way for it.<lb facs="P17_TL00006"/>&amp; The production of the Merchant of Venice, ....the scenery, lighting, costume, etc. can be<lb facs="P17_TL00007"/>said to have been done better elsewhere. Henry Irving did it a thousand times better and<lb facs="P17_TL00008"/>in a far more original manner, and that was twenty eight years ago. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>Critics, considering the value of a poetic stage production, should bear in mind that the<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>first quality necessary is that distinction which Irving was so well able to bring into all his work<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>no matter if it were only in the choice of a costume or in the performance of a part. Nothing with<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>him was hurridly done. All the characters must be of the Shakespearian breed, must have the<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>stamp of Shakespeare on them. All the scenes must have the colour and the grace of<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>Shakespeare's comedy, not the dowdy clumsiness of low class modern life. &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>&amp; And so you see in spite of the imitations which the Deutches theater goes in for, they<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>are neither realistic like Stanislosky nor idealistic like Craig. In the case of the " Salome "<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>they had the same vast blue sky cloth which Mr Craig first introduced in London<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>in 1900 and which he repeated in many of his other productions on account of the<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>tragic quality of the colour. And instead of being content with this they heaped<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>a lot of bad architectural doors and pillars round about, they filled the stage with<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>shouting actors whose movements were crude and modern, and a German lady was told to<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>perform the part of Salome. But the draw back of the German actor and actress is that<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>they can only do that which they have thought out; they must always "think out" what<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>they do. The result was that Salome's performance was invested with a little " thought out"<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>passion. Instead of the performance which a Mimi Aguglia would have given us, a thing so<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>abandoned that by its very force it leapt the gulf betwixt vulgarity and the terrible, the<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>German lady was content to remain on this side of the chasm and to represent for us<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>something which was lifeless,<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>&amp; And now the productions. They may be described as "cheap",... possibly because they<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>are cheap, though this does not follow. The Germans, unlike the Americans, are<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>frightened of spending money, and there is a particular kind of theatrical management that<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>shakes in its shoes at the idea of spending money, though it demands its fair pound of flesh<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>in return from the poor martyred audience. I should not be surprised if the management of<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>the Deutches Theater could be classed in this category. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>The actors cannot be accused of looking very thin, but, on the other hand the production<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>is extremely thin; and the idea is forced upon us that perhaps, perhaps, this theatre is run<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>so as to bring in a fat income to some man or group of men who, not content with making<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>money by legitimate means, turn to the arts and squeeze the artists and the art of its life's<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>blood.<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>&amp; We know there are many such theatres in the world, and they are a disgrace to the<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>management which permits such a system. &amp; Here again we are forced to speak of Henry<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>Irving. It was not his habit to be what is called " stingy " or to stint anything, no matter<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>how costly, towards the attainment of what he considered perfection. That and that alone<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>is the right attitude for a management to take, and if they are not able to run the theatre<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>with their own money they should only accept capitalists whe are willing to agree to these<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>conditions. Capitalists who possess the same spirit as the old patrons,... lovers and supporters<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>of the Dramatic art, not capitalists who drain the resources of a theatre at the same time as<lb facs="P17_TL00048"/>they pretend to support it. These are odious to all right spirited actors, actresses or<lb facs="P17_TL00049"/>theatrical managers, and the loan of their mere money is death to the theatre.<lb facs="P17_TL00050"/>No, the Deutches Theater is by no means an ideal theatre although we may give it<lb facs="P17_TL00051"/>unqualified praise for its energy. How this energy will be appreciated when the company<lb facs="P17_TL00052"/>visits New York in the spring remains to be seen, for the American public have already<lb facs="P17_TL00053"/>seen how Shakespeare ought-to be played, and they have seen Henry Irving, Salvini, Madame<lb facs="P17_TL00054"/>Duse, Sarah Bernhardt and Ellen Terry. One thing is quite clear from all this. The<lb facs="P17_TL00055"/>Deutsches Theater is not today one of the first theatres in Europe when judged by artistic<lb facs="P17_TL00056"/>standards: and its business transactions are.... well, queer, to say the least of " it " is right<lb facs="P17_TL00057"/>grammar I believe.</ab>

Yet we have a knack of sizing<lb facs="P20_TL00019"/>up a Napoleon or a Plato as if we knew him,<lb facs="P20_TL00020"/>or ever could know the least hint of him and<lb facs="P20_TL00021"/>we feel satisfied that we have drawn a fairly<lb facs="P20_TL00022"/>good picture of him. &amp; &amp;&gt;<lb facs="P20_TL00023"/>Miss Ellen Terry draws for us the picture of<lb facs="P20_TL00024"/>Henry Irving, gives sketches of other people,<lb facs="P20_TL00025"/>including her son and daughter, and we are<lb facs="P20_TL00026"/>inclined to believe that she is satisfied that<lb facs="P20_TL00027"/>the pictures are likenesses. We are of another<lb facs="P20_TL00028"/>opinion for the reason stated above.<lb facs="P20_TL00029"/>Miss Terry prefaces her book by Walt<lb facs="P20_TL00030"/>Whitman's famous passage, &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00031"/>" When I read the book, the biography<lb facs="P20_TL00032"/>famous,<lb facs="P20_TL00033"/>" And is this then (said 1) what the author<lb facs="P20_TL00034"/>calls a man's life?<lb facs="P20_TL00035"/>" And so will some one when I am dead<lb facs="P20_TL00036"/>and gone write my life ?<lb facs="P20_TL00037"/>" (As if any man really knew aught of my<lb facs="P20_TL00038"/>life?<lb facs="P20_TL00039"/>" Why even I myself often think know<lb facs="P20_TL00040"/>little or nothing of my real life,<lb facs="P20_TL00041"/>" Only a few hints, a few diffused faint<lb facs="P20_TL00042"/>clews and indirections<lb facs="P20_TL00043"/>" 1 seek for my own use to trace out here).<lb facs="P20_TL00044"/>" As if any man really knew aught of my life!"<lb facs="P20_TL00045"/>&amp; Quoting this line Miss Terry renders<lb facs="P20_TL00046"/>worthless all she writes of other people. It<lb facs="P20_TL00047"/>sounds like the voice of Irving saying,... " As<lb facs="P20_TL00048"/>if any man really knew aught of my life ".<lb facs="P20_TL00049"/>Whitman's verse was but the prelude to his<lb facs="P20_TL00050"/>own song of himself and is out of place<lb facs="P20_TL00051"/>elsewhere. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00052"/>I think we are correct in saying that Miss<lb facs="P20_TL00053"/>Terry, like so many of her predecessors, has<lb facs="P20_TL00054"/>received assistance in the writing of her book.<lb facs="P20_TL00055"/>The hands are Esau's, yet somehow the voice<lb facs="P20_TL00056"/>is often another's.

The journal<lb facs="P21_TL00012"/>is printed in three languages, English, Italian<lb facs="P21_TL00013"/>and French with occasional illustrations<lb facs="P21_TL00014"/>which add interest to the numbers. <lb facs="P21_TL00015"/>&amp; That the magazine should exist at all is<lb facs="P21_TL00016"/>strange. We hear much today of the<lb facs="P21_TL00017"/>actor, of the personality of this man and that<lb facs="P21_TL00018"/>woman, yet when they are no longer with<lb facs="P21_TL00019"/>us how little they influence things! This<lb facs="P21_TL00020"/>little journal, the echo of that really great<lb facs="P21_TL00021"/>personality, Buonaparte, proves its force,<lb facs="P21_TL00022"/>Actors very often remind us of halfpenny<lb facs="P21_TL00023"/>Napoleons. In attempting through what they<lb facs="P21_TL00024"/>call character and personality to overpower<lb facs="P21_TL00025"/>all those they come in touch with they<lb facs="P21_TL00026"/>create in those people a kind of amazed<lb facs="P21_TL00027"/>stupefaction by this assumed strength. Put<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>the actor against any other man and he will<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>get the better of him. The other will not<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>be conviced but he will be stupified, and the<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>actor, absolutely unconscious of the real<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>effect he has created, takes the stupifaction<lb facs="P21_TL00033"/>for admiration. &lt;£?<lb facs="P21_TL00034"/>There is no doubt about it that the sooner<lb facs="P21_TL00035"/>the actor drops the role of a great personality<lb facs="P21_TL00036"/>the better for him and his work, for although<lb facs="P21_TL00037"/>he assumes the role he cannot carry it out<lb facs="P21_TL00038"/>to the end. First of all there is not the call<lb facs="P21_TL00039"/>for him to be so very " great " a man. He<lb facs="P21_TL00040"/>has not to deal with kings, continents and<lb facs="P21_TL00041"/>armies but with the imitation of these things.<lb facs="P21_TL00042"/>He is continually pretending to turn other<lb facs="P21_TL00043"/>kings off their thrones, slaying the usurper<lb facs="P21_TL00044"/>or becoming betrothed to a Queen of France<lb facs="P21_TL00045"/>or he is a great Priest overturning religions<lb facs="P21_TL00046"/>and substituting others, and all this produces<lb facs="P21_TL00047"/>in him the attitude of a man who holds the<lb facs="P21_TL00048"/>Fate of Europe in his hand. Bat the attitude<lb facs="P21_TL00049"/>is not enough to qualify him to assume these<lb facs="P21_TL00050"/>roles off the stage and therefore if his art<lb facs="P21_TL00051"/>is to be held in reverence the actor's<lb facs="P21_TL00052"/>personality off the stage must be an entirely<lb facs="P21_TL00053"/>unassuming one. He must be as simple as<lb facs="P21_TL00054"/>any other artist. This quality of sernplicity<lb facs="P21_TL00055"/>we often find in the little comedians, who<lb facs="P21_TL00056"/>of all people on the stage are the least spoilt.<lb facs="P21_TL00057"/>&amp; But we recommend this review<lb facs="P21_TL00058"/>" Napoleonienne " to the actors, for in it they<lb facs="P21_TL00059"/>can see the difference between a great man<lb facs="P21_TL00060"/>and one who apes a great man.</ab>

When a young girl<lb facs="P21_TL00109"/>tells her stage lover that she is all the world<lb facs="P21_TL00110"/>to him she suggests that she is thinking of<lb facs="P21_TL00111"/>the world and his wife at church, and what<lb facs="P21_TL00112"/>they will say when the banns are published.<lb facs="P21_TL00113"/>Add to this a kind of tremulous sea sickness<lb facs="P21_TL00114"/>in voice and appearance, and you have a<lb facs="P21_TL00115"/>picture of the stage maiden in a love scene.<lb facs="P21_TL00116"/>This is awful! awful!! Awful!!! &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00117"/>The young man is no better. He is a young<lb facs="P21_TL00118"/>hypocrite, not a lover, not a man. He<lb facs="P21_TL00119"/>effectually pumps up his emotion before our<lb facs="P21_TL00120"/>eyes,... oh, horrible!... and he seems to look<lb facs="P21_TL00121"/>more in pity than in love upon the object<lb facs="P21_TL00122"/>of his choice. The result is an impression of<lb facs="P21_TL00123"/>sensuality,... sensuality to a degree which only<lb facs="P21_TL00124"/>the English actors know how to achieve. &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00125"/>The young people generally paint their faces</ab>

He lisps his<lb facs="P22_TL00028"/>anathema upon the Professional Theatre, and<lb facs="P22_TL00029"/>says " his idea " Is something quite different.<lb facs="P22_TL00030"/>He then sets about copying Harker, Wilhelm,<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>Gordon Craig and Percy Anderson. He is<lb facs="P22_TL00032"/>(alas!) often a distinguished illustrator of<lb facs="P22_TL00033"/>children's fairy books or a designer and maker<lb facs="P22_TL00034"/>of stained-glass windows. He has perhaps<lb facs="P22_TL00035"/>lately made illustrations to a Shakespeare<lb facs="P22_TL00036"/>play, and feels that by right of this he may<lb facs="P22_TL00037"/>claim kinship with the Theatre. How many<lb facs="P22_TL00038"/>times has it to be repeated that the Theatre<lb facs="P22_TL00039"/>is not for the amateur: that it is as difficult<lb facs="P22_TL00040"/>a study as the earth has to offer, and that no<lb facs="P22_TL00041"/>one but he who gives his whole life to this<lb facs="P22_TL00042"/>study can hope to bring any light into the<lb facs="P22_TL00043"/>Theatre.<lb facs="P22_TL00044"/>It is an impertinence on the part of these<lb facs="P22_TL00045"/>excellent " designers " to waste the time of<lb facs="P22_TL00046"/>the stage and of the public. A production<lb facs="P22_TL00047"/>of Shakespeare on the stage is an entirely<lb facs="P22_TL00048"/>different problem from the illustration of his<lb facs="P22_TL00049"/>plays in a book. It takes nothing short of a<lb facs="P22_TL00050"/>life-time for an artist to learn the limitations<lb facs="P22_TL00051"/>of the stage, and only a stage manager can<lb facs="P22_TL00052"/>ever thoroughly know these limitations. An<lb facs="P22_TL00053"/>illustrator whose whole charm lies in the<lb facs="P22_TL00054"/>strangely sharp quality of his pen work and<lb facs="P22_TL00055"/>the faint and delicate washes of colour which<lb facs="P22_TL00056"/>he adds to his designs, will give the scene<lb facs="P22_TL00057"/>painter and costumier a most ungrateful<lb facs="P22_TL00058"/>task if he brings such designs for their<lb facs="P22_TL00059"/>consideration. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00060"/>Mr C.

His imitations<lb facs="P22_TL00064"/>are on a level with the imitations of Miss<lb facs="P22_TL00065"/>Maud Allen.

Writing of these<lb facs="P23_TL00083"/>two he says: jgr &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00084"/>44 Possibly a good deal has been written on the<lb facs="P23_TL00085"/>44 aesthetics of stage scenery, but the<lb facs="P23_TL00086"/>44 productions of our stage recognise no<lb facs="P23_TL00087"/>44 aesthetic canons. On the one hand, we have<lb facs="P23_TL00088"/>44 the lavish magnificence of His Majesty's<lb facs="P23_TL00089"/>44 Theatre, which attempts to carry out what<lb facs="P23_TL00090"/>44 has been shabbily done for years, and is<lb facs="P23_TL00091"/>44 not a new thing; on the other, there are<lb facs="P23_TL00092"/>44 the experiments of Mr. Gordon Craig, whose<lb facs="P23_TL00093"/>44 obsession it is to produce schemes of colour<lb facs="P23_TL00094"/>44 and line which often dwarf the players in<lb facs="P23_TL00095"/>44 a quaint manner. Mr Gordon Craig views<lb facs="P23_TL00096"/>44 his stage as so much material for his designs,<lb facs="P23_TL00097"/>44 and I contend that is wrong, for the players<lb facs="P23_TL00098"/>44 are of the first importance. His experiments<lb facs="P23_TL00099"/>44 have this merit, however. They do not<lb facs="P23_TL00100"/>44 bring to our notice by emphasis that scenery<lb facs="P23_TL00101"/>44 at its best is but a flimsy make=believe.<lb facs="P23_TL00102"/>44 Tliatj I take it, should be the basis of any<lb facs="P23_TL00103"/>44 aesthetic consideration of the subject".<lb facs="P23_TL00104"/>This is warranted to give an entirely<lb facs="P23_TL00105"/>erroneous idea to the public; it is really<lb facs="P23_TL00106"/>guaranteed to do a great deal of mischief.<lb facs="P23_TL00107"/>What we want in a critic is that, at any rate,<lb facs="P23_TL00108"/>he may be quite sure of his facts. How is<lb facs="P23_TL00109"/>Mr Baughan sure that His Majesty's Theatre<lb facs="P23_TL00110"/>attempts to carry out with lavish magnificence<lb facs="P23_TL00111"/>what has been shabbily done for years! &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00112"/>How does Mr Baughan know that Mr Craig's<lb facs="P23_TL00113"/>aim is to produce schemes of color and line<lb facs="P23_TL00114"/>or that Mr Craig views his stage as so much<lb facs="P23_TL00115"/>material for designs? Surely, if, as Pope says,<lb facs="P23_TL00116"/>44 The proper study of mankind is Man," then<lb facs="P23_TL00117"/>the proper study of the critic should be the<lb facs="P23_TL00118"/>artist, and this is what Mr Baughan does not<lb facs="P23_TL00119"/>seem to have begun to do. &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00120"/>His statement about Mr Craig is wrong from<lb facs="P23_TL00121"/>beginning to end. &lt;€*&amp;&amp;&gt;&amp;■<lb facs="P23_TL00122"/>Why should this first=class critic be content<lb facs="P23_TL00123"/>to open his interesting Essay with a false<lb facs="P23_TL00124"/>statement, when by making enquiries in the<lb facs="P23_TL00125"/>right quarters, he could have ascertained what<lb facs="P23_TL00126"/>Mr Craig's views are, or what his aim is?<lb facs="P23_TL00127"/>&amp; Mr Baughan is at perfect liberty to state,<lb facs="P23_TL00128"/>as he does a little further on, that the<lb facs="P23_TL00129"/>appearance of reality must be the first object<lb facs="P23_TL00130"/>of a dramatic representation, although most<lb facs="P23_TL00131"/>artists would disagree with him entirely on<lb facs="P23_TL00132"/>this point; still, he is giving his opinion, and<lb facs="P23_TL00133"/>that must interest us all. But when he<lb facs="P23_TL00134"/>misstates the opinions of artists, he over»steps<lb facs="P23_TL00135"/>all &lt;£? &amp; &amp; &amp;</ab>
                                    <ab facs="P24_TB00002">
                                       <lb facs="P24_TL00002"/>A critic should be more careful than to do<lb facs="P24_TL00003"/>such a thing, and we feel very decidedly that<lb facs="P24_TL00004"/>a critic should confine himself to one of two<lb facs="P24_TL00005"/>things: he should either write about the<lb facs="P24_TL00006"/>theory of the art, or, he should write about<lb facs="P24_TL00007"/>the theatre as it is to-day, accepting its<lb facs="P24_TL00008"/>vulgarities as things not to be avoided, and<lb facs="P24_TL00009"/>taking a decided stand in favor of the modern<lb facs="P24_TL00010"/>theatre as it is. But to be neither a theory<lb facs="P24_TL00011"/>student of the art nor to be a thorough<lb facs="P24_TL00012"/>student of the modern theatre puts a critic<lb facs="P24_TL00013"/>in an awkard position from which, in time,<lb facs="P24_TL00014"/>he will not be able to extricate himself. &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00015"/>We have heard it said that a critic is not often<lb facs="P24_TL00016"/>allowed to write all he would, and it is implied<lb facs="P24_TL00017"/>by this that his best is with=held from us. But,<lb facs="P24_TL00018"/>is not this a little bit of an excuse? What<lb facs="P24_TL00019"/>Editor ever refused a brilliant criticism ?<lb facs="P24_TL00020"/>what critic was ever rejected for taking up<lb facs="P24_TL00021"/>a definite position ?<lb facs="P24_TL00022"/>We should that Mr Baughan could, with great<lb facs="P24_TL00023"/>advantage to himself, spend two years<lb facs="P24_TL00024"/>studying Mr Tree's work at His Majesty's<lb facs="P24_TL00025"/>Theatre. He would then learn the difficulties<lb facs="P24_TL00026"/>which beset the modern theatre and he would<lb facs="P24_TL00027"/>then perhaps understand, He would have<lb facs="P24_TL00028"/>to study it from the stage itself and not from<lb facs="P24_TL00029"/>the front of the house. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00030"/>There is less excuse for Mr Baughan making<lb facs="P24_TL00031"/>mistakes about Mr Craig's works, for if he<lb facs="P24_TL00032"/>likes he can read what Mr Craig has written<lb facs="P24_TL00033"/>and whenever he chooses to do so; he will<lb facs="P24_TL00034"/>then have no excuse for making further mis=<lb facs="P24_TL00035"/>statements as to Mr. Craig's intention in<lb facs="P24_TL00036"/>his art. &amp; &amp;</ab>

Then, too, Mosher has<lb facs="P2_TL00061"/>reprinted only the gems of literature that have been declared of the first water; gems that<lb facs="P2_TL00062"/>are, beyond objection, jewels of the world's treasury of brilliant writing. We may also<lb facs="P2_TL00063"/>assert that the question of gain has been secondary in Mosher's calculations. He has put<lb facs="P2_TL00064"/>out very small editions, and he has made them so beautiful in all that concerns their make-<lb facs="P2_TL00065"/>up that it is doubtful if he has ever gauged the expenditure by the possible profit.

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>|n most of our theatres nowadays opera glasses are provided for a small sum for those who<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>have not brought a pair with them and who like to see what is going on on the stage.<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>The opera glass is a modern invention with which the actor does not seem able to cope;<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>in some cases one wonders whether he is even acquainted with its existence. The members<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>of the audience in the meantime quietly suffer: they cannot see clearly without glasses and<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>if they use glasses they see too much. You want to see the heroine, but it is distressing to<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>see her with black marks round the eyes, and it is worse still to find the hero painted like<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>a doll. Painting the face on the stage is a barbarous custom come down to us from the<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>age of oil lamps and candles. With gas and electric light, and opera glasses for the remote<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>seats in the house, it is not needed. To say that painting counteracts defects caused by<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>the footlights is a plea for the abolition of top and side lights. Were it the case, it is creating<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>one evil to eliminate another. With a good pair of glasses the man in the pit can appreciate<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>a fine complexion on the stage almost as well as off. Apd as with paint, so it is with stage<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>accessories; the audience see them as clearly as do the actors, only with different eyes;<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>for the eyes of the latter are dulled from constant irritation in the same way that one's<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>ears become accustomed, by time, to the most untuneful of barrel organs. &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>Opera glasses are apt to turn tragedy to comedy and comedy to farce. Without facial expression<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>a modern play is almost impossibie, The audience, gradually accustomed to the caricature<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>of passion as expressed by the painted actor, call it all acting, and when an unpainted actor<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>or actress comes on to the stage it is said to be nature and not art. On the Music Hall<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>Stage it is different: the more subtle effects are, as a rule, not aimed at. The young lady<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>who babbles of green fields never intends you to suppose for an instant that she cares a<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>rap about them save at a distance, and you feel sure that if you were her wedded lover<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>you would spend your honeymoon in visiting other Music Halls. The men are nearly all<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>painted masks, without the disadvantage of the fixed expression. An opera glass does not<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>spoil the effect; if you are tired of the play of features accompanying the patter you can<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>admire the painting and the broad brushwork. It is not altogether the free use of tobacco<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>that makes these places of entertainment so attractive; they are places where you can use<lb facs="P8_TL00045"/>your opera glass with enjoyment and without fear. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00046"/>&amp; In the theatre, if painting the face is to continue, it would be well if a stage painter<lb facs="P8_TL00047"/>were attached to every Company so that there might be some uniformity and perspective,<lb facs="P8_TL00048"/>for painting is an art of which only a few actors are masters, and it is unfair for the actor<lb facs="P8_TL00049"/>who uses paint sparingly to be thrown into the background by one who puts it on with a<lb facs="P8_TL00050"/>pallet knife. At all events lessons on the scope of the opera glass should be taken with</ab>

And he is again<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>mistaken if he believes that Shakespeare himself was of this opinion. Any man who is really<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>possessed by mad ambition will watch this, his emblem, with delight; and the very fact<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>that the hero perishes in his passion is the strongest charm in the hot cup of this delight.<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>Were the poet's feelings different to these? How royally and not In the least knavishly his<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>ambitious hero runs his course from the hour of his great crime I Only then he grows<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>" demoniacally " attractive and encourages similar natures to imitation—demoniacal means<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>here: in defiance of advantage and life, in favour of an idea and craving. Do you imagine<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>that Tristan and Isolde give a warning example of adultery though its being the cause of<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>their death? This would be turning the poets upside down : for they, and Shakespeare above<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>all, are in love with the passions themselves, and no less with their yearnings for death—<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>when the heart does not cling to life more firmly than the drop of water does to the glass.<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>It is not so much guilt and its evil conseguences which they—Shakespeare as well as Sophocles<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>(in Ajax, Philoctetes GEdipus)—wish to portray; however easy it might have been in the<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>aforesaid eases to make guilt the lever of the play, they carefully refrained from so doing<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>&amp; Neither is it the wish of the tragic poet to prejudice us against life by means of his<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>representations of life. Nay, he explains: " It is the charm of charms, this exciting, variable,<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>hazardous, gloomy and often sun»steeped existence! It is an adventure to live!—with<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>whatever party you side in life, it will ever retain this character." Thus he speaks in a<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>restless and vigorous age, which is partly intoxicated and dazed by its superabundance of<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>blood and energy—in an age more evil than ours: wherefore we must needs begin by adapting<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>and accommodating the purpose of a Shakesperian play—that is, by not understanding it.</ab>

A genial companion,<lb facs="P11_TL00009"/>and spreading a sense of companionship in the theatre; generous in giving assistance to<lb facs="P11_TL00010"/>younger and less accomplished actors,.... continually speaking about the work,.... picturesque<lb facs="P11_TL00011"/>in his manner,.... able to hold his own when standing at the side of the stage instead of<lb facs="P11_TL00012"/>in the centre;.... with a voice which commands my attention when 1 hear it,.... and finally,<lb facs="P11_TL00013"/>with about as much knowledge of the art as a cuckoo has of anything which is at all<lb facs="P11_TL00014"/>constructive. Anything to be made according to plan or design is foreign to his nature.<lb facs="P11_TL00015"/>But his good nature tells him that others are on the stage besides himself, and that there<lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>must be a certain feeling of unity between their thoughts and his, yet this arrives by a<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>kind of good natured instinct and not through knowledge, &amp; produces nothing positive. Instinct<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>and experience have taught him a few things, (I am not going to call them tricks), which<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>he continually repeats. For instance, he has learned that the sudden drop in the voice<lb facs="P11_TL00020"/>from forte to piano has the power of accentuating apd thrilling the audience as much as<lb facs="P11_TL00021"/>the crescendo from the piano into the forte. He also knows that laughter is capable of very<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>many sounds, and not merely Ha Ha Ha. He knows that geniality is a rare thing on the stage<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>and that the bubbling personality is always welcomed. But what he does not know is this <lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>that this same bubbling personality and all this same instinctive knowledge doubles or even<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>trebles its power when guided by scientific knowledge, that is to say, by art. If he should<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>hear me say this now he would be lost in amazement and would consider that I was saying<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>something which was finicking, dry, and not at all for the consideration of an artist. He<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>is one who thinks that emotion creates emotion, and hates anything to do with calculation.<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>It is not necessary for me to point out that all art has to do with calculation and that the<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>man who disregards this can only be but half an actor. Nature will not alone supply all<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>which goes to create a work of art, for it is not the privilege of trees, mountains and brooks<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>to create works of art, or everything which they touch would be given a definite and<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>beautiful form. It is the particular power which belongs to man alone, and to him through<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>his intelligence and his will. My friend probably thinks that Shakespeare wrote Othello in<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>a passion of jealousy and that all he had to do was to write the first words which came into<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>his mouth; but Iam of the opinion,.... and I think others hold the same opinion,.... that<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>the words had to pass through our author's head and that it was just through this process<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>and through the quality of his imagination and the strength of his brain that the richness<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>of his nature was able to be entirely and clearly expressed, and by no other process could<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>he have arrived at this.<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>Therefore it follows that the the actor who wishes to perform .... Othello, let us say, must<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>have not only the rich nature from which to draw his wealth, but must also have the<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>imagination to know what to bring forth, and the brain to know how to put it before us.<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>Therefore the ideal actor will be the man who possesses both a rich nature and a powerful<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>brain. Of his nature we need not speak. It will contain everything. Of his brain we can<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>say that the finer the brain the less liberty will it allow itself, remembering how much<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>depends upon its co-worker, the Emotion, and also the less liberty will it allow its fellow<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

He would not ramp and rage up and down in Othello, rolling his eyes<lb facs="P12_TL00010"/>and clenching his hands in order to give us an impression of jealousy; he would tell his<lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>brain to enquire into the depths, to learn all that lies there, and then to remove itself to<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>another sphere, the sphere of the imagination, and there fashion certain symbols which,<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>without exhibiting the bare passions, would none the less tell us clearly about them. &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>And the perfect actor who should do this would in time find out that the symbols are to<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>be made mainly from material which lies outside his person. &amp; But I will speak to you<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>fully about this when I get to the end of our talk. For then I shall show you that the actor<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>as he is today, must ultimately disappear and be merged in something else if works of art<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>are to be seen in our kingdom of the Theatre (i).<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>Meantime do not forget that the very nearest approach that has ever been to the ideal<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>actor, with his brain commanding his nature, has been Henry Irving. There are many books<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>which tell you about him, and the best of all the books is his face. Procure all the pictures,<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>photographs, drawings, vois can of him, and try to read what is there. &amp; To begin with you<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>will find a mask, and the significance of this is most important. &amp; I think you will find it<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>difficult to say when you look on the face, that it betrays the weaknesses which may have<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>been in the nature. &amp; Try and conceive for yourself that face in movement, movement<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>which was ever under the powerful control of the mind. &amp; Can you not see the mouth<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>being made to move by the brain, and that same movement which is called expression<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>creating a thought as definite as the line of a draughtsman does on a piece of paper or as a<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>chord does in music ? Cannot you see the slow turning of those eyes and the enlargement<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>of them? &amp; These two movements alone contained so great a lesson for the future of the<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>art of the theatre, .... pointed out so clearly the right use of expression as opposed to the<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>wrong use, that it is amazing to me that many people have not seen more clearly what<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>the future must be. I should say that the face of Irving was the connecting link between<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>that spasmodic and ridiculous expression of the human face as used by the theatres of the<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>last few centuries, and the masks which will be used in place of the human face in the near<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>future. &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>&amp; Try and think of all this when losing hope that you will ever bring your nature as<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>exhibited in your face and your person under sufficient command. &lt;£? Know for a truth that<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>there is something other than your face and your person which you may use and which is<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>easier to control. &amp; Know this, but make no attempt yet awhile to close with it. Continue<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>to be an actor, continue to learn all that has to be learned, as to how they set about controlling<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>the face, and then you will learn finally that it is not to be entirely controlled.^<lb facs="P12_TL00043"/>I give yqu this hope so that when this moment arrives you will not do as the other<lb facs="P12_TL00044"/>actors have done. They have been met by this difficulty and have shirked it, have<lb facs="P12_TL00045"/>compromised, and have not dared to arrive at the conclusion which an artist must arrive<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>at if faithful to himself. &amp; That is to say, that the mask is the only right medium of<lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>portraying the expressions of the soul as shown though the expressions of the face.</ab>

Did<lb facs="P13_TL00010"/>not the costumiere come tearfully to you saying that some one had taken a dress from its box<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>and substituted another? Did you not request the costumiere to bring the offending party<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>before you ? and did you not have to manage these two in some tactful way so as to<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>off end neither of them, and yet so as to get at the truth of the matter ?.... And did you ever<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>get at the truth of the matter? And did these two go away nursing anything but a loathdd<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>*<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>hate towards you?.... Put the best case,.... one of them liked you, and the other began to<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>intrigue against you the next hour. Did you find yourself still on the stage at about half<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>past ten, and did not the actors arrive at that hour apparently in total ignorance that you<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>had been there already four hours, and with their superb conviction that the doors of the<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>theatre had just that moment been opened because they had arrived ? And did not at<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>least six of these actors in the next quarter of an hour come up to you and with an 44 I say,<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>old chap, " or 44 Look here, old fellow ", start asking you to arrange something for them on<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>the stage so as to make their task a little easier? And were not the things which they asked<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>all so opposed one to the other, that to assist any one actor would have been to offend the<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>other five ? &amp; Having told them that you would do your best, were you not relieved by the<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>sudden appearence of the director of the theatre, generally the chief actor ? And did you<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>not instantly go to him with the different requests which had been made to you, hoping<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>that he, as master, would take the responsibility of arranging all these difficult matters ?<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>And did he not reply to you, 44 Don't bother me with these details; please do what you<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>think best and did you not then instantly know in your heart of hearts that the whole<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>thing was a farce,.... the title, the position, and all ? &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>And then the rehearsal commenced. &amp; The first words are spoken; the first difficulty<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>arrives. The play opens with a conversation between two gentlemen seated at a<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>table. &amp; Having gone on for about five minutes, the director interrupts with a gentle<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>question. He asks if he is not correct in saying that at yesterday's rehearsal Mr. Brown<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>rose at this or that line, twisting his chair back with a sudden movement? The actor,<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>a trifle distressed that he has been the cause of the first delay in the day's proceedings,<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>and yet not wishing to take any fault to himself, asks with equal courtesy, 44 Are these the<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>chairs which we are supposed to use on the night?" &amp; The director turns to the stage<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>manager, and asks him, 44 Are these the chairs we use upon the night ? " &amp; 44 No, Sir "<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>replies the stage manager. A momentary look of disapproval, ever so slight, passes from<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>the director, and is reflected upon the faces of the two actors, and a little restless wind<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>passes round the theatre. It is the first little hitch. " 44 I think it would be best to<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>use at rehearsal the chairs we are going to use on the night ". &amp;44 Certainly, Sir,! " The<lb facs="P13_TL00045"/>stage manager claps his hands. «&lt;£? 44 Isherwood, " he cries,... A thin, sad looking little<lb facs="P13_TL00046"/>man, with a mask which is impenetrable on account of its extreme sadness, comes on to the<lb facs="P13_TL00047"/>stage and stands before the judgment seat. &amp; He hesitates. 44 We shall use the chairs at<lb facs="P13_TL00048"/>rehearsal which have been ordered for this scene. " 44 No chairs, Sir, have been ordered<lb facs="P13_TL00049"/>for this scene. " &amp; The wind rises. A sharp flash of lightening shows itself on the face of<lb facs="P13_TL00050"/>the director, and a sudden frown of thunder hangs upon the brows of the actors. The<lb facs="P13_TL00051"/>stage manager asks to see the property list, that is to say, the list of things used in the<lb facs="P13_TL00052"/>scene. Isherwood casts his eyes pathetically across the desert of the stage in search of<lb facs="P13_TL00053"/>the leading lady. &amp; Being the wife of the director, she has seen no reason for arriving<lb facs="P13_TL00054"/>in time. When she arrives she will have the look upon her face of having been concerned<lb facs="P13_TL00055"/>with more important business elsewhere. Isherwood replies, 441 had orders, Sir, to put<lb facs="P13_TL00056"/>these two chairs in Scene II, as they are chairs with pink and red brocade Great moment<lb facs="P13_TL00057"/>for the director.

Hence the waste<lb facs="P14_TL00006"/>of time in many theatres and certainly in many English Theatres. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00007"/>&amp; This is but one and the first trial of the stage manager, who rather plays the part of<lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>the tyre than the axel of the wheel of the stage. &amp; The rehearsal continues. The stage<lb facs="P14_TL00009"/>manager has to be there all the time with but little control and permitted to have less<lb facs="P14_TL00010"/>opinions, and yet held responsible for all errors; and after it is over, while the actors<lb facs="P14_TL00011"/>may retire to their luncheon, he must retire to the property room, the scene painting room,<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>the carpenters room, must hear all their grievances, must see everything being delayed<lb facs="P14_TL00013"/>and when the company returns to the theatre fresh after a pause of an hour or so he is<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>expected to be as fresh and as good humoured without a break of a minute. This would be<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>an easy &amp; pleasant matter if he had the authority of his title; that is to say, iff in his contract<lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>lay the words " Entire and absolute control of the stage and all that is on the stage."<lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>But it is none the less a good if a strange experience. It teaches the man who assumes<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>these terrible responsabilities how great a need there is for him to study the science of the<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>stage, so that when it comes to his turn to be the director of the theatre, he may dispense<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>with the services of a so-called 4 stage manager ' by being the veritable stage manager<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>himself.<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>You will do well, after having remained an actor for five years to assume these difficult<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>responsabilities of stage manager for a year or two, and never forget that it is a position<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>capable of development. About the ideal stage manager I have written in my book *• The Art of<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>the Theatre", and I have shown there that the nature of his position should make him the most<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>important figure in the whole world of the theatre. It should therefore be your aim to<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>become such a man,... one who is able to take a play and produce it himself, rehearsing the<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>actors and conveying to them the requirements of each movement, each situation;.... designing<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>the scenery and the costumes and explaining to those who are to make them the requirements<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>of these scenes and costumes;.... and working with the manipulators of the artificial light,<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>and conveying to them clearly what is required. &amp;&amp;&amp;&lt;&amp;£&gt;&amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>Now, if I had nothing better to bring to you than these suggestions, if I had no further<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>ideal, no further truth, to reveal to you about the stage and about your future than this<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>that I have told you of, I should consider that I had nothing to give you whatever and I<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>should urge you to think no more of the theatre. But I told you at the beginning of my letter<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>that I was going to give you all sorts of things to cheer yourself with, so that you should<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>have absolute faith in the greatness of the task which you set out to achieve; and here<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>I remind you of this again lest you should think that this ideal manager of whom I speak<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>is the ultimate achievement possible for you. It is not. Read what I have written<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>about him in the " Art of the Theatre, " and let that suffice you for the time being; but rest<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>perfectly sure that I have more, much more to foliow, and that your Hope shall be so high,<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>that no other Hope, not even that of the poets or the priests, shall be higher. &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>To return to the duties of the stage manager. &amp; I take it that I have already explained<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>to you, or that you have already experienced, these ordinary difficulties, and that you have<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>learned that great tact is required and no great talent. &amp; You have only to take care that<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>in exercising this tact you do not become a little diplomatist, for a little diplomatist is a<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>dangerous thing. Keep fresh your desire to emerge from that position, and your best way<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>to do this is to study how to master the different materials which, later on, you will have<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>to work in when your position is that of the ideal stage manager. You will then possess<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>your own theatre, and what you place upon your stage will all be the work of your brain,<lb facs="P14_TL00051"/>much of it the work of your hands, and you must waste no time so as to be ready.</ab>

Now, quickly, take and accept this statement from not a single<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>other colour, but only these two colours through your whole progress of designing your<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>scene and your costumes, yet forget not that each colour contains many variations. If you are<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>timid for a moment and mistrust yourself or what I tell, when the scene is finished you will<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>not see with your eye the effect you have seen with your mind's eye, when looking at the<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>picture which Shakespeare has indicated. £?£*&amp;&amp;&amp;?&amp; &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>&amp; It is this lack of courage, lack of faith in the value which lies in limitation and in<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>proportion which is the undoing of all the good ideas which are born in the minds of the<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>scene designers. They wish to make twenty statements at once. They wish to tell us not only<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>of the lofty crag and the mist which clings to it; they wish to tell you of the moss of the<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>Highlands and of the particular rain which descends in the month of August. They cannot<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>resist showing that they know the form of the ferns of Scotland, and that their archeological<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>research has been thorough in all matters relating to the Castles of Glamis and Cawdor.<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>And so in their attempt to tell us these many facts, they tell us nothing; all is confusion....<lb facs="P15_TL00053"/>44 Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope the Lord's annointed Temple, and stole thence<lb facs="P15_TL00054"/>the life of the building". <lb facs="P15_TL00055"/>&amp; So, do as I tell you. Practice with the pencil on paper both on a small scale and on a<lb facs="P15_TL00056"/>large scale; practice with colour on canvas; so that you may see for yourself that what I<lb facs="P15_TL00057"/>say to you is true .... and, if you are an Englishman, make haste! for if you do not others<lb facs="P15_TL00058"/>who read this in other countries will find in it technical truths and will outstrip you before<lb facs="P15_TL00059"/>you are aware of it. But the rock and its cloud of mist is not all that you have to<lb facs="P15_TL00060"/>consider. &amp; You have to consider that at the base of this rock swarm the clans of strange<lb facs="P15_TL00061"/>earthly forces, qnd that in the mist hover the spirits innumerable;.... to speak more technically</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00005"/>you have to think of the 60 or 70 actors whose movements have to be made at the base<lb facs="P16_TL00006"/>of the scene, and of the other figures which obviously may not be suspended on wires, and<lb facs="P16_TL00007"/>yet must be seen to be clearly separate from the human and more material beings,<lb facs="P16_TL00008"/>It is obvious then that some curious sense of a dividing line must be created somewhere upon<lb facs="P16_TL00009"/>the stage so that the beholder, even if he look but with his corporal eye, shall be convinced<lb facs="P16_TL00010"/>that the two things are separate things. &amp; I will tell yon how to do this. Line and<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>proportion having suggested the material rock-like substance, tone and colour (one colour)<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>will have given the etherial to the mist-like vacuum. Now then, you bring this tone and<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>colour downwards until it reaches nearly to the level of the floor; but you must be careful<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>to bring this colour and this tone down in some place which is removed from the material<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>rock-like substance. &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>You ask me to explain technically what I mean. Let your rock possess but half the width<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>of the stage, Let it be the side of a cliff round which many paths twist, and let these|paths<lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>mingle in one flat space taking up half or perhaps three quarters of the stage. You have<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>room enough there for all your men and women. Now then, open your stage and all other<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>parts. Let there be a void below as as well as above, and in this void let your mist fall and<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>fade; and from that bring the figures which you have fashioned and which are to stand for the<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>spirits. &amp; I know you are yet not quite comfortable in your mind about this rock and this<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>mist; I know that you have got in the back of your head the recollection that a little later<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>on in the play come several 'interiors' as they are called, &amp; But, bless your heart, don't bother<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>about that! call to mind that the interior of a castle is made from the stuff which is taken<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>from the quarries. Is it not precisely the same colour to begin with? and do not the blows<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>of the axes which hew out the great stones give a texture to each stone which resembles<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>the texture given it by natural means, as rain, lightening, frost? &amp; So you will not have<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>to change your mind or change your impression as you proced. You will have but to give<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>variations of the same theme, the rock the brown; the mist.... the grey; and by these<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>means you will, wonder of wonders, actually have preserved unity. &amp; Your success will<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>depend upon your capacity to make variations upon these two themes; but remember never<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>to let go of the main theme of the play when searching for variations in the Scene.<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>&amp; By means of your scene you will be able to mould the movements of the actors, and you<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>must be able to increase the impression of your numbers without actually adding another<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>man to your 40 or 50. You must not therefore waste a single man, nor place him in such a<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>positiou that an inch of him is lost. Therefore the places on which he walks must be the most<lb facs="P16_TL00038"/>carefully studied parts of the whole scene. But in telling you not to waste an inch of<lb facs="P16_TL00039"/>him I do not therefore mean to convey that you must show every inch of him. It is<lb facs="P16_TL00040"/>needless to say more on this point. By means of suggestion you may bring on the stage<lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>a sense of all things; the rain, the sun, the wind, the snow, the hail, the intense heat; but<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>you will never bring them there by attempting to wrestle and close with nature, in order<lb facs="P16_TL00043"/>so that you may seize some of her treasure and lay it before the eyes of the multitude.<lb facs="P16_TL00044"/>By means of suggestion in movement you may translate all the passions and the thoughts<lb facs="P16_TL00045"/>of vast numbers of people, or by means the same you can assist your actor to convey<lb facs="P16_TL00046"/>the thoughts and the emotions of the particular character he impersonates Actuality,<lb facs="P16_TL00047"/>accuracy of detail, is useless upon the stage. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00048"/>&amp; Do you want further directions as to how to become a designer of scenes and how to<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>make them beautiful, &amp;, let us add for the sake of the cause, practical and inexpensive?^I am<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>afraid that if I were to commit my method to writing I should write something down which<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>would prove not so much useless as bad. For it might be very dangerous for many people<lb facs="P16_TL00052"/>to imitate my method. It would be a different thing if you could study with me, practising<lb facs="P16_TL00053"/>what we speak about for a few years. Your nature would in time learn to reject that which<lb facs="P16_TL00054"/>was unsuited to it, and, by a daily and a much slower initiation, only the more important<lb facs="P16_TL00055"/>and valuable parts of my teaching would last. But I can give you now some more general<lb facs="P16_TL00056"/>ideas of things which you might do with advantage and things which you may leave undone.<lb facs="P16_TL00057"/>For instance, to begin with, don't worry;—particularly don't worry your brain, and for<lb facs="P16_TL00058"/>Heaven's sake don't think it is important that you have got to do something, especially<lb facs="P16_TL00059"/>something clever.<lb facs="P16_TL00060"/>1 call to mind the amount of trouble I had when I was a boy of 21 over the struggle to<lb facs="P16_TL00061"/>somehow produce designs traditional in character without feeling at all in sympathy with</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00002"/>the tradition; and I count it as so much wasted time. I do not hold with others that it<lb facs="P17_TL00003"/>was of any value whatever. £? I remember making designs for scenes for Henry IV. I was<lb facs="P17_TL00004"/>working under an actor manager at the time. I was working in a theatre where the chairs<lb facs="P17_TL00005"/>and the tables and other matters of detail played important and photographic parts, and,<lb facs="P17_TL00006"/>not knowing any better, I had to take all this as a good example The play of Henry IV<lb facs="P17_TL00007"/>therefore consisted to my mind of one excellent part, Prince Hal, and 30 or 40 other<lb facs="P17_TL00008"/>characters that trotted round this part. &amp; There was the usual table with the chairs round<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>it on the right side. There at the back was the usual door, and I thought it rather unique<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>and daring at the time to place this door a little bit off the straight. There was the window<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>with the latches and the bolts and the curtains ruffled up to look as if they had been used for<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>sometime, and outside the glimpses of English landscape. There were the great flagons; and<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>of course, on the curtain rising there was to be a great cluster and fluster of "scurvy knaves"<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>who ran in and out, and a noise of jovial drinkers in the next room. There was the little<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>piece of jovial music to take up the curtain, that swinging jig tune which we have all<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>grown so familiar with, there were the three girls who pass at the back of the window,<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>laughing. One pops her head in at the window with a laugh and a word to the potman.<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>Then there is the dwindling of the laughter and the sinking to piano of the orchestra as<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>the first speaking character enters,... and so on. &amp; <lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>My whole work of that time was based on these stupid restless dotails which I had been<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>led to suppose a production could be made from ; and it was only when I banished the whole<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>of this from my thoughts and no longer permitted myself to see with the eyes of the producers<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>of the period of Charles Kean, that I began to find anything fresh which might be of<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>value to the play. And so for me to tell you how to make your scenes is well nigh<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>impossible. It would lead you into terrible blunders. I have seen some of the scenery which<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>is supposed to be produced according to my teaching, and it is utter rubbish.<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>I let my scenes grow out of not merely the play, but from broad sweeps of thought<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>which the play has conjured up in me, or even other plays by the same author have conjured<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>up. For instance, the relation of Hamlet to Macbeth is quite close, and the one play may<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>influence the other. &amp; I have been asked so many times by people eager to make a little<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>swift success or a little money, to explain to them carefully, how I make my scenes; because,<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>said they with sweet simplicity, " then I could make some too ", You will hardly believe<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>it, but the strangest of people have said this to me and if I could be of service to them<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>without being treacherous to myself as an artist, and to the art, I would always do so.<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>But you see how vain that would be! To tell them in five minutes or in five hours or even<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>in a day how to do a thing which it has taken me a life time to begin to do would be utterly<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>impossible. And yet when I have been unable to bring myself to tear my knowledge up into<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>little shreds and give it to these people they have been most indignant, at times malignant.<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>And so you see it is not that I am unwilling to explain to you the size and shape of my<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>back-cloths, the colour which is put upon them, the pieces of wood that are not to be attached<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>to them, the way they are to be handled, the lights that are to be thrown upon them, and<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>how and why I do everything else; it is only that if 1 were to tell you, though it might<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>be of some service to you for the next two or three years, and you could produce several<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>plays with enough effects therein to satisfy the curiosity of quite a number of people,.....<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>though you would benefit to this extent you would lose to a far greater extent, and the Art<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>would have in me its most treacherous minister We are not concerned with short cuts.<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>We are not concerned with what is to be effective and what is to pay. We are concerned<lb facs="P17_TL00048"/>with the heart this thing, and with loving and understanding it. Therefore approach it from<lb facs="P17_TL00049"/>all sides, surround it, and do not let yourself be attracted away by the idea of scene as an end<lb facs="P17_TL00050"/>in itself, of costume as an end in itself, or of stage management or any of these things,<lb facs="P17_TL00051"/>and never lose hold of your determination to win through to the secret.... the secret which<lb facs="P17_TL00052"/>lies in the creation of another beauty and then all will be well. &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00053"/>&amp; In preparing a play, while your mind is thinking of scene, let it instantly leap round<lb facs="P17_TL00054"/>and consider the acting, movement and voice. Decide nothing yetinstantly leap back to<lb facs="P17_TL00055"/>another thought about another part of this unit. &amp; Consider the movement robbed of all<lb facs="P17_TL00056"/>scene, all costume, merely as movement. Somehow mix the movement of the person with<lb facs="P17_TL00057"/>the movement which you see in your mind's eye in the scene. Now pour all your colour<lb facs="P17_TL00058"/>upon this. Now wash away all the colour. Now begin over again. Consider only the words.</ab>

DO you see at all what I mean Look at the thing from every standpoint<lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>and through every medium, and do not hasten to begin your work until one medium force<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>you to commence. You can far sooner trust other influences to move your will and even<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>your hand that you can trust your own little human brain. This may not be the methodical<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>teaching of the schools. The results they achieve are on record,and the record is nothing<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>to boast about. Hard, matter of fact, mechanical teaching may be very good for a class,<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>but it is not much good for the individual; and when I come to teach a class 1 shall not<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>teach them so much by words as by practical demonstration. &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>By the way, I may tell you one or two things that you will find good not to do. For<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>instance, do not trouble about the costume books. When in a great difficulty refer to<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>one in order to see how little it will help you out of your difficulty, but your best plan is<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>never to let yourself become complicated with these things. Remain clear and fresh. If you<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>study how to draw a figure, how to put on it a jacket, coverings for the legs, covering for<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>the head, and try to vary these coverings in all kinds of interesting, amusing, or beautiful<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>ways, you will get much further than if you feast your eyes and confound your brain with<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>Racinet, Planchet, Hottenroth and the others. The coloured costumes are the worst, and<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>you must take great care with these and be utterly independent when you come to think<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>about what you have been looking at. Doubt and mistrust them thoroughly. If you find<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>afterwards that they contain many good things you will not be so far wrong; but if you<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>accept them straight away your whole thought and sense for designing a costume will be<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>lost; you will be able to design a Racinet costume or a Planchet costume, and you will lean<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>far too much on these historically accurate men who are at the same time historically untrue.<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>Better than these that I have mentioned is Viollet le Due. He has much love for the<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>little truths which underlie costume, and is very faithful in his attitude; but even his is<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>more a book for the historical novelist, and one has yet to be written abqut imaginative<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>costume. &amp; Keep continually designing such imaginative costumes. For example, make a<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>barbaric costume; and a barbaric costume for a sly man which has nothing about it which can<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>be said to be historical and yet is both sly and barbaric. &amp; Now make another design for<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>another barbaric costume, for a man who is bold and tender. NOW make a third for one<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>who is ugly and vindictive* &amp; It will be an exercise. You will probably make blunders at<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>first for it is no easy thing to do but I promise you if you persevere long enough you will<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>be able to do it. Then go further; attempt to design the clothing for a divine figure<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>and for a demonic figure: These of course will be studies in individual costumes,<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>but the main strength of this branch of the work lies in the costume as mass. It is the<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>mistake of all theatrical producers that they consider the costumes of the mass individually.<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>It is the same when they come to consider movements, the movements of masses on the<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>stage. You must be careful not to follow the custom. We often hear it said that each<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>member of the Meinigen Company composing the great crowd in Julius Caesar was acting<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>a special part of his own. This may be very exciting as a curiosity, and attractive to<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>a rather foolish audience, who would naturally say, " Oh, how interesting to go and look<lb facs="P18_TL00046"/>at one particular man in a corner who is acting a little part of his own! How wonderful!<lb facs="P18_TL00047"/>It is exactly like life! ",.... And if that is the standard and if that is our aim, well and good.<lb facs="P18_TL00048"/>But we know that it is not. Masses must be treated as masses, as Rembrandt treats<lb facs="P18_TL00049"/>a mass, as Bach, as Beethoven treats a mass, and detail has nothing to do with the mass.<lb facs="P18_TL00050"/>Detail is very well in itself and in its place. You do not make an impression of mass by<lb facs="P18_TL00051"/>Crowding a quantity of details together. Detail is made to form mass only by those people<lb facs="P18_TL00052"/>who love the elaborate, and it is a much easier thing to crowd a quantity of details together,<lb facs="P18_TL00053"/>than it is to create a mass which shall possess beauty and interest. On the stage they<lb facs="P18_TL00054"/>instantly turn to the natural when they wish to create this elaborate structure.... A hundred<lb facs="P18_TL00055"/>men to compose a crowd, or, let us say, all Rome, as in Julius Caesar; a hundred men, and<lb facs="P18_TL00056"/>each is told to act his little part. Each acts himself, giving vent to his own cries; each<lb facs="P18_TL00057"/>a different cry, .... though many of them copy the most effective ones so that by the end of<lb facs="P18_TL00058"/>the first 20 nights they are all giving out the same cry. And each of them has his own<lb facs="P18_TL00059"/>action, which after the first twenty nights is exchanged for the most effective and popular<lb facs="P18_TL00060"/>action; and by this means a fairly decent crowd of men with waving arms and shouting</ab>

It is to prevent such things being written that you exist. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00011"/>&amp; This tendency towards the natural has nothing to do with art, and is abhorrent when<lb facs="P21_TL00012"/>it shows in art, even as artificiality is abhorrent when we meet it in every day life. We<lb facs="P21_TL00013"/>must understand that the two things are divided, and we must keep each thing in its place;<lb facs="P21_TL00014"/>we cannot expect to rid ourselves in a moment of this tendency to be " natural"; to make<lb facs="P21_TL00015"/>" natural " scenes, and speak in a " natural" voice, but we can fight against it best by<lb facs="P21_TL00016"/>studying the other arts. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00017"/>Therefore we have to put the idea of natural or unnatural action out of our heads<lb facs="P21_TL00018"/>altogether, and in place of it we have to consider necessary or unnecessary action. The<lb facs="P21_TL00019"/>necessary action at a certain moment may be said to be the natural action for that moment;<lb facs="P21_TL00020"/>and if that is what is meant by 1 natural9 well and good. In so far as it is right it is natural,<lb facs="P21_TL00021"/>but we must not get into our heads that every haphazard natural action is right. In fact<lb facs="P21_TL00022"/>there is hardly any action which is right, there is hardly any which is natural. Action is a<lb facs="P21_TL00023"/>way of spoiling something, says Rimbaud. &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00024"/>&amp; And to train a company of actors to show upon the stage the actions which are seen in<lb facs="P21_TL00025"/>every drawing room, club, public house or garret must seem to everyone nothing less<lb facs="P21_TL00026"/>than tomfoolery. That companies are so trained is well known, but it remains almost incredible<lb facs="P21_TL00027"/>in its childishness. Just as I told you to invent costume which was significant, so must<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>you invent a series of significant actions, still keeping in mind the great division which<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>exists between action in the mass and action in the individual, and remembering that no<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>action is better than little &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>I have told you to make three costumes based on the idea of a barbaric sense, each<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>particularized by some special individuality. Give action to these figures which you have made.<lb facs="P21_TL00033"/>Create for them significant actions, limiting yourself to those three texts that I have given<lb facs="P21_TL00034"/>you, the sly, the bold tenderness, the ugly and vindictive. Make studies for these, carry<lb facs="P21_TL00035"/>your little book or pieces of paper with you and continually be inventing with your pencil<lb facs="P21_TL00036"/>little hints of forms and faces stamped with these three impressions; and when you have<lb facs="P21_TL00037"/>collected dozens of them select the most beautiful. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00038"/>And now for a word on this. £? I particularly did not say the most * effective9 although<lb facs="P21_TL00039"/>1 used the word * beautiful7 as the artists use it, not as those of the stage use it.<lb facs="P21_TL00040"/>I tcannot be expected to explain to you all that the artist means by the word beautiful;<lb facs="P21_TL00041"/>but to him it is something which has the most balance about it, the justest thing, that<lb facs="P21_TL00042"/>which rings a complete and perfect bell note. Not the pretty, not the smooth, not the<lb facs="P21_TL00043"/>superb always, and not always the rich, seldom the « effective 7 as we know it in the theatre,<lb facs="P21_TL00044"/>although at times that, too, is the beautiful. But Beauty is so vast a thing, and contains<lb facs="P21_TL00045"/>nearly all other things; contains even ugliness, which sometimes ceases to be what is held as<lb facs="P21_TL00046"/>ugliness, and contains harsh things, but never incomplete things.<lb facs="P21_TL00047"/>&amp; Once let the meaning of this word " Beauty 77 begin to be thoroughly felt once more in<lb facs="P21_TL00048"/>the theatre, and we may say that the awakening day of the theatre is near. Once let the word<lb facs="P21_TL00049"/>* effective 7be wiped off our lips, and they will be ready to speak this word Beauty. When<lb facs="P21_TL00050"/>we speak about the effective, we in the theatre mean something which will reach across the foot<lb facs="P21_TL00051"/>lights. The old actor tells the young actor to raise his voice, to " Spit it out";.... " Spit it out,<lb facs="P21_TL00052"/>laddie, fling it at the back of the gallery" Not bad advice either; but to think that<lb facs="P21_TL00053"/>this has not been learnt in the last five or six hundred years, and that we have not got<lb facs="P21_TL00054"/>further; that is what is so distressing about the whole business. Obviously all stage<lb facs="P21_TL00055"/>actions and all stage words must first of all be clearly seen, must be clearly heard. Naturally<lb facs="P21_TL00056"/>all pointed actions and all pointed speeches must have a clear and distinct form so that<lb facs="P21_TL00057"/>they may be clearly understood.^We grant all this. It is the same in all art, &amp; as with the<lb facs="P21_TL00058"/>other arts it goes without saying; but it is not the one &amp; only essential thing which the</ab>

It teaches the young actor soon to become a master of tricks, fie takes the<lb facs="P22_TL00007"/>short cut instinctively to these tricks, and this playing of tricks has been the cause of the<lb facs="P22_TL00008"/>invention of a word,—" Theatricaland I can put my finger on the reason why the young<lb facs="P22_TL00009"/>actor labours under this disadvantage the moment he begins his stage experience. It is<lb facs="P22_TL00010"/>because previous to his experience he has passed no time as student or as apprentice.<lb facs="P22_TL00011"/>&amp; I do not know that I am such a great believer in the schools. I believe very much indeed<lb facs="P22_TL00012"/>in the general school which the world has to offer us, but there is this great difference<lb facs="P22_TL00013"/>between the " world " schooling of the actor and the " world " schooling of the other artists<lb facs="P22_TL00014"/>who do not go to the Academies either. A young painter, or a young musician, a young<lb facs="P22_TL00015"/>poet, or a young architect, or a young sculptor may never enter an Academy during his<lb facs="P22_TL00016"/>life, and may have ten years knocking about in the world learning here, learning<lb facs="P22_TL00017"/>there, experimenting and labouring unseen and his experiments unnoticed. &amp; The young<lb facs="P22_TL00018"/>actor may not enter an Academy either, and he may also knock about in the world, and<lb facs="P22_TL00019"/>he too may experiment just the same as the others, but and here is the vast difference <lb facs="P22_TL00020"/>all his experiments he must make in front of a public. Every little atom of his work<lb facs="P22_TL00021"/>from the first day of his commencing until the last day of his apprenticeship must be seen,<lb facs="P22_TL00022"/>and must come under the fire of criticism. I shall ever be beholden to the higher criticism,<lb facs="P22_TL00023"/>and for a man of ten year's experience a£ any work to come under the fire of criticism will<lb facs="P22_TL00024"/>benefit him and his work a thousandfold. He has prepared himself; he has strength; he<lb facs="P22_TL00025"/>knows what he is going to face. But for every boy and girl to be subjected to this the first<lb facs="P22_TL00026"/>year that they timidly attempt this enormous task is not only unfair on them but is<lb facs="P22_TL00027"/>disastrous to the art of the stage. &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00028"/>&amp; Let us picture ourselves as totally new to this work. We are on fire with the desire to<lb facs="P22_TL00029"/>begin our work. Willingly and with an enormous courage we accept some small part. It<lb facs="P22_TL00030"/>is eight lines and we appear for ten minutes. We are delighted although almost in a<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>panic. Say it is twenty lines.... Do you think we say no? We are to appear six times,... do<lb facs="P22_TL00032"/>you ithink we shall run away? We may not be angels but we are certainly not fools for<lb facs="P22_TL00033"/>stepping in. It appears to us heaven. On we go Next morning "Itis a pity that the<lb facs="P22_TL00034"/>manager elected an incompetent young man to fill so important a part ". &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00035"/>&amp; I am not blaming the critic for writing this ; I am not saying that it will kill a great artist or<lb facs="P22_TL00036"/>that it will break our heart; I only say that this seems so unfair that it is only natural that<lb facs="P22_TL00037"/>we retaliate by taking an unfair advantage of the very art which we have commenced<lb facs="P22_TL00038"/>to love, by becoming " effective " at all costs. &amp; We have received this criticism; we have<lb facs="P22_TL00039"/>done our best; the others have received good criticism; we can stand it no longer; we do<lb facs="P22_TL00040"/>as they do,.... we become 44 effective ". It takes most young actors but five years' acute<lb facs="P22_TL00041"/>suffering to become effective, to become theatrical. Too early criticism breaks the young<lb facs="P22_TL00042"/>actor who would be an artist as far as possible, and causes him to be a traitor to the art<lb facs="P22_TL00043"/>which he loves. Beware of this and rather be ineffective. Receive your bad criticism<lb facs="P22_TL00044"/>with a good grace and with the knowledge that with patience and with pride you can outlive<lb facs="P22_TL00045"/>and outdistance all around you. It is right that the critic should say that you were<lb facs="P22_TL00046"/>ineffective at a certain moment, or that you played your part badly, if you have been but three,<lb facs="P22_TL00047"/>four or five years on the stage, and if you are but still feeling your way slowly, instead of<lb facs="P22_TL00048"/>rushing to tricks for support. It is quite right of them to say that, for they are speaking<lb facs="P22_TL00049"/>the entire truth; you should be glad of this; but unconsciously they disclose a still greater<lb facs="P22_TL00050"/>truth. It is this; That the better the artist the worse the &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00051"/>So take entire courage. Continue as I have said at the beginning to remain an actor<lb facs="P22_TL00052"/>until you can stand it no longer, until you feel you are on the point of giving way; then<lb facs="P22_TL00053"/>leap nimbly aside into the position of stage manager. And here as I have pointed out you<lb facs="P22_TL00054"/>will be in a better position if not a much better position, for you are approaching the point<lb facs="P22_TL00055"/>at which stands, (slumbering, it is true) the artist of the theatre. Your most effective scenes,<lb facs="P22_TL00056"/>productions, costumes and the rest, will of course be the most theatrical ones. But here<lb facs="P22_TL00057"/>tradition is not so strong, and it is here that you will find something that you can rely on.<lb facs="P22_TL00058"/>The critic is not more lenient towards the producer of plays, but some how or other he<lb facs="P22_TL00059"/>is less inclined to use the word * effective'. He seems to have a wider knowledge of the beauty<lb facs="P22_TL00060"/>or the ugliness of these things. It may be that the tradition of his art permits him this; for<lb facs="P22_TL00061"/>production, as it is understood nowadays, is but a more modern development of the theatre,</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P23_TL00002"/>and the critic has more liberty to say what he wishes. &amp; At any rate, when you become stage<lb facs="P23_TL00003"/>manager, you will no longer have to appear each evening upon the stage in person, and<lb facs="P23_TL00004"/>therefore anything which is written about your work you cannot take in a personal way.<lb facs="P23_TL00005"/>I thought to tell you here something about the uses of artificial light; but apply what<lb facs="P23_TL00006"/>1 have said of scene and costume to this other branch as well. Some of it may apply. &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00007"/>To tell you of the instruments which they use, how they use them so as to produce beautiful<lb facs="P23_TL00008"/>results, is not quite practical. If you have the wit to invent the scenes and the costumes<lb facs="P23_TL00009"/>that I have spoken about, you will soon have the wit to find your own way of using the<lb facs="P23_TL00010"/>artificial light we are given in the theatre. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00011"/>&amp; Finally, before we pass out of the theatre on to other more serious matters, let me give<lb facs="P23_TL00012"/>you the last advice of all When in doubt listen to the advice of a man in a theatre<lb facs="P23_TL00013"/>even if he is only a dresser, rather than pay any attention to the amateur. A few painters,<lb facs="P23_TL00014"/>a few writers, and a few musicians, have used our theatre as a kind of afterthought.<lb facs="P23_TL00015"/>Take care to pay no attention to what they say or what they do. An ordinary<lb facs="P23_TL00016"/>stage hand knows more about our art than these amateurs. The painter has lately<lb facs="P23_TL00017"/>been making quite a pretty little raid upon the outskirts of the stage. He is very often<lb facs="P23_TL00018"/>a man of much intellectual ability and full of very many excellent theories, the old and<lb facs="P23_TL00019"/>beautiful theory of art which each in his own piece of soil knows how to cultivate best;<lb facs="P23_TL00020"/>and these theories he has exemplified in his own particular branch of art so well. In the<lb facs="P23_TL00021"/>theatre they become sheer affectation. It is reasonable to suppose that a man who has<lb facs="P23_TL00022"/>spent fifteen to twenty years of his life painting in oils on a flat surface, etching on copper,<lb facs="P23_TL00023"/>or engraving on wood will produce something which is pictorial and has the qualities of the<lb facs="P23_TL00024"/>pictorial but nothing else. And so with the musician; he will produce something which is<lb facs="P23_TL00025"/>musical. So with the poet; he will produce something which is literary. It will all be very<lb facs="P23_TL00026"/>picturesque and pretty, but it will unfortunately be nothing to do with the Art of the<lb facs="P23_TL00027"/>Theatre. Beware of such men; you can do without them. If you have anything<lb facs="P23_TL00028"/>to do with them you will end by being an amateur yourself. If one of these should wish<lb facs="P23_TL00029"/>to talk with you about the theatre be careful to ask him how long he has actually<lb facs="P23_TL00030"/>worked in a theatre before you waste any more time listening to his unpractical theories.<lb facs="P23_TL00031"/>as the last but one word was about these men so the last word of all shall be about their<lb facs="P23_TL00032"/>work. Their work is so fine, they have found such good laws and have followed these laws so well,<lb facs="P23_TL00033"/>have given up all their worldly hopes in this one great search after beauty, that when nature<lb facs="P23_TL00034"/>seems to be too difficult to understand, go straight to these fellows,.... I mean to their<lb facs="P23_TL00035"/>work .... and they will help you out of all the difficulties, for they are the best and the<lb facs="P23_TL00036"/>wisest people in the world.<lb facs="P23_TL00037"/>&amp; And now I intend to carry you on beyond this stage management about which I have spoken,<lb facs="P23_TL00038"/>and unveil to you some greater possibilities which I think are in store for you.<lb facs="P23_TL00039"/>&amp; I have come to the end of talking with you about matters as they are, and I hope you will<lb facs="P23_TL00040"/>pass through those years as actor, manager, designer and producer without any very great<lb facs="P23_TL00041"/>disturbances. To do this successfully, although in your apprenticeship you must hold your<lb facs="P23_TL00042"/>own opinion, you must hold it very closely to yourself; and above all things remember that I do<lb facs="P23_TL00043"/>not expect you to hold my opinion or to stand up for it publicly. To do that would be to<lb facs="P23_TL00044"/>weaken your position and to weaken the value of this preparation time. It is of no value to<lb facs="P23_TL00045"/>me that people should be convinced of your belief in the truth of my statements, theories or<lb facs="P23_TL00046"/>practises: it is of great value to me that you should be so convinced. And so as to let nothing<lb facs="P23_TL00047"/>stand in the way of that I would have you run no risks, but keep our convictions to ourselves. Try<lb facs="P23_TL00048"/>to win no support for me. Run no risk of being faced with the dismissal from your post with<lb facs="P23_TL00049"/>the option of the denial of our mutual beliefs. Besides, there is no need for either of these<lb facs="P23_TL00050"/>two alternatives. I have taken so large a share of the rebuffs by loudly proclaiming my<lb facs="P23_TL00051"/>beliefs in the cause of the truth of this work, and am always prepared to take more if you<lb facs="P23_TL00052"/>will but leap forwards and secure the advantages, using me as the stalking horse. I shall<lb facs="P23_TL00053"/>appreciate the fun, for there is a spice of fun in it all .... and that will be my reward. &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00054"/>Remember we are attacking a monster; a very powerful &amp; subtle enemy; and when you signal<lb facs="P23_TL00055"/>to me let it be by that more secret means even than wireless telegraphy. I shall understand<lb facs="P23_TL00056"/>the communication.<lb facs="P23_TL00057"/>&amp; When you have finished your apprenticeship, ....6 to 10 years,.... there will be no need<lb facs="P23_TL00058"/>to use further concealment: you will then be fitted to step out and, in your turn, unfurl</ab>

It explains<lb facs="P24_TL00008"/>best what I mean. &amp; May be in the next three or four thousand years the word Kingdom<lb facs="P24_TL00009"/>will have disappeared, ....Kingdom,.... Kingship, ....King,... but I doubt it; and if it<lb facs="P24_TL00010"/>does go something else equally fine will take its place. It will be the same thing in a different<lb facs="P24_TL00011"/>dress. &amp; You can't invent anything finer than Kingship... the idea of the King. It is merely<lb facs="P24_TL00012"/>another word for the Individual, the calm shrewd personality; and so long as this<lb facs="P24_TL00013"/>world exists the calmest and the shrewdest personality will always be the King. In some<lb facs="P24_TL00014"/>rare instances he is called the President, but he is none the less the King. In some instances<lb facs="P24_TL00015"/>«<lb facs="P24_TL00016"/>he is called the Pope, &amp; sometimes the General; it all comes to the same thing, and<lb facs="P24_TL00017"/>it is no good denying it; he is the King. To the artist the thought is very dear. There<lb facs="P24_TL00018"/>is the sense of the perfect balancer. The king (to the artist) is that superb part of<lb facs="P24_TL00019"/>the scales, which the old workmen made in gold and sometimes touched with beautiful<lb facs="P24_TL00020"/>stones;... the delicately worked handle without which the scales could not exist and upon<lb facs="P24_TL00021"/>which the eye of the measurer must be fixed. Therefore I have taken as the device of<lb facs="P24_TL00022"/>our new Art these scales, for our art is based upon the idea of perfect balance, the result<lb facs="P24_TL00023"/>of movement.<lb facs="P24_TL00024"/>Here then is the thing which 1 promised at the beginning to bring to you. Having passed<lb facs="P24_TL00025"/>through your apprenticeship without having been merged in the trade, you are fitted to<lb facs="P24_TL00026"/>receive this. Without having done so you would not even be able to see it. I have<lb facs="P24_TL00027"/>no fear that what I throw to you now will be caught by other hands because it is visible<lb facs="P24_TL00028"/>and tangible only to those who have passed through such an apprenticeship. In the<lb facs="P24_TL00029"/>beginning with you it was Impersonation; you passed on to Representation, and now you<lb facs="P24_TL00030"/>advance into Revelation. When Impersonating and Representing you made use of those<lb facs="P24_TL00031"/>materials which had always been made use of; that is to say, the human figure as exemplified<lb facs="P24_TL00032"/>in the actor, speech as exemplified in the poet through the actor, the visible world as shown<lb facs="P24_TL00033"/>by means of Scene. You now will reveal by means of movement the Invisible things, ...<lb facs="P24_TL00034"/>those seen through the eye and not with the eye, by the wonderful and divine power of<lb facs="P24_TL00035"/>Movement. &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00036"/>There is a thing which man has not yet learned to master, a thing which man dreamed<lb facs="P24_TL00037"/>not was waiting for him to approach with love; it was invisible and yet ever present with<lb facs="P24_TL00038"/>him Superb in its attraction and swift to retreat, a thing waiting but for the approach<lb facs="P24_TL00039"/>of the right men.... prepared to soar with them through all the circles beyond the earth....<lb facs="P24_TL00040"/>Movement.<lb facs="P24_TL00041"/>It is somehow a common belief that only by means of words can truths be revealed.'Even<lb facs="P24_TL00042"/>the wisdom of China has said. 44 Spiritual truth is deep and wide, of infinite exellence,<lb facs="P24_TL00043"/>44 but difficult of comprehension Without words it would be impossible to expound its<lb facs="P24_TL00044"/>" doctrine; without images its form could not be revealed. Words explain the law of two<lb facs="P24_TL00045"/>44 and six, images delineate the relation of four and eight. Is it not profound,.... as infinite as<lb facs="P24_TL00046"/>44 space,.... beyond all comparison lovely?" &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00047"/>But what of that infinite and beautiful thing drawn from space called Movement?<lb facs="P24_TL00048"/>From Sound has been drawn that wonder of wonders called Music. Music,.... one could<lb facs="P24_TL00049"/>speak of it as St Paul speaks of love. It is all Tove ....it is all that he says true love should<lb facs="P24_TL00050"/>be. It suffereth all things, &amp;is kind; is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly;<lb facs="P24_TL00051"/>believeth all things, hopeth all things, infinitely vast! &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00052"/>&amp; And as like as one sphere to another, so is movement like to music. I like to<lb facs="P24_TL00053"/>remember that all things spring from movement, even music; and I like to think that it is to<lb facs="P24_TL00054"/>be our supreme honour to be the ministers to the supreme force Movement &amp; For you<lb facs="P24_TL00055"/>see where the theatre (even the poor distracted and desolate theatre) is connected with this<lb facs="P24_TL00056"/>service. The theatres of all lands, east and west, have developed (if a degenerate development)<lb facs="P24_TL00057"/>from movement the movement of the human form. We know so much for it is on<lb facs="P24_TL00058"/>record ; and before the human being assumed the grave responsability of using his own person<lb facs="P24_TL00059"/>as an instrument through which this Beauty should pass, there was another and a wiser<lb facs="P24_TL00060"/>race, who used other instruments. &amp; jg? &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00061"/>&amp; In the earliest days the dancer was a priest or a priestess, and not a gloomy one by<lb facs="P24_TL00062"/>any means; too soon to degenerate into something more like the acrobat, and finally to achieve</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P25_TL00002"/>the distinction of the ballet dancer. By association with the minstrel, the actor appeared. Ido<lb facs="P25_TL00003"/>not hold, that with the renaissance of the dance comes the renaissance of the ancient art of the<lb facs="P25_TL00004"/>theatre, for I do not hold that the ideal dancer is the perfect instrument for the expression of all<lb facs="P25_TL00005"/>that is most perfect in movement. &amp; The ideal dancer, male or female, is able by the strength or<lb facs="P25_TL00006"/>grace of the body to express much of the strength and grace which is in the nature, but it<lb facs="P25_TL00007"/>cannot express all, nor a thousandth part of that all. For the same truth applies to the dancer<lb facs="P25_TL00008"/>#<lb facs="P25_TL00009"/>and to all those who use their own person as instrument. Alas, the human body refuses to<lb facs="P25_TL00010"/>be an instrument, even to the mind which lodges in that body. The sons of Los rebelled<lb facs="P25_TL00011"/>and still rebel against their father. The old divine unity, the divine square, the peerless<lb facs="P25_TL00012"/>circle of our nature has been ruthlessly broken by our moods, and no longer can instinct<lb facs="P25_TL00013"/>design the square or draw the circle on the grey wall before it. But with a significant<lb facs="P25_TL00014"/>gesture we thrill our souls once more to advance without our bodies upon a new road and<lb facs="P25_TL00015"/>win it all back again. This is a truth which is not open to argument, and a truth which<lb facs="P25_TL00016"/>does not lessen the beauty which exhales from the dearest singer or the dearest dancer of<lb facs="P25_TL00017"/>all times.<lb facs="P25_TL00018"/>To me there is ever something more seemly in man when he invents an instrument which<lb facs="P25_TL00019"/>is outside his person, and through that instrument translates his message. I have a greater<lb facs="P25_TL00020"/>admiration for the organ, for the flute and for the lute than I have for the human<lb facs="P25_TL00021"/>voice when used as instrument. I have a greater feeling of admiration and fitness when<lb facs="P25_TL00022"/>I see a machine which is made to fly than when I see a man attaching to himself the wings<lb facs="P25_TL00023"/>of a bird. For a man through his person can conquer but little, but through his mind he<lb facs="P25_TL00024"/>can conceive and invent that which shall conquer all things.<lb facs="P25_TL00025"/>I believe not at all in the personal magic of man, but only in his impersonal magic. It<lb facs="P25_TL00026"/>seems to me that we should not forget that we belong to a period after the Fall and not<lb facs="P25_TL00027"/>before it,.... I can at least extract a certain hint from the old story. And though it may be<lb facs="P25_TL00028"/>only a story, I feel that it is just the very story for the artist. &amp; In that great period<lb facs="P25_TL00029"/>previous to this event we can see in our mind's eye the person of man in so perfect a<lb facs="P25_TL00030"/>state that merely to wish to fly was to fly, merely to desire that which we call the impossible<lb facs="P25_TL00031"/>was to achieve it. We seem to see man flying into the air or diving into the depths and<lb facs="P25_TL00032"/>taking no harm therefrom. We see no foolish clothes, we are aware of no hunger and thirst.<lb facs="P25_TL00033"/>But now that we are conscious that this " square deific " has been broken in upon, we<lb facs="P25_TL00034"/>must realise that no longer is man to advance and proclaim that his person is the perfect<lb facs="P25_TL00035"/>and fitting medium for the expression of the perfect thought.<lb facs="P25_TL00036"/>So we have to banish from our mind all thought of the use of a human form as the<lb facs="P25_TL00037"/>instrument which we are to use to translate what we call Movement. We shall be all the<lb facs="P25_TL00038"/>stronger without it. We shall no longer waste time and courage in a vain hope. £? The<lb facs="P25_TL00039"/>exact name by which this art will be known cannot yet be decided on, but it would be a<lb facs="P25_TL00040"/>mistake to return and look for names in China, India or Greece. We have words enough in our<lb facs="P25_TL00041"/>English language, and let the English word become familiar to the tongues of all the nations.<lb facs="P25_TL00042"/>I have written elsewhere, and shall continue to write, all about this matter as it grows in<lb facs="P25_TL00043"/>me, and you from time to time will read what I write. But I shall not remove from you<lb facs="P25_TL00044"/>the very difficulty which will be the source of your pleasure; I wish to leave all open and<lb facs="P25_TL00045"/>to make no definite rules as to how and by what means these movements are to be shown.<lb facs="P25_TL00046"/>This alone let me tell you. I have thought of and begun to make my instrument, and<lb facs="P25_TL00047"/>through this instrument I intend soon to venture in my quest of beauty. How do I know<lb facs="P25_TL00048"/>whether I can achieve that or not? Therefore how cari I tell you definitely what are the<lb facs="P25_TL00049"/>first rules which you have to learn? Alone and unaided I can reach no final results.<lb facs="P25_TL00050"/>It will need the force of the whole race to discover all the beauties which are in this<lb facs="P25_TL00051"/>great source,.... this new race of artists to which you belong. When I have constructed<lb facs="P25_TL00052"/>my instrument and permitted it to make its first assay I look to others to make like<lb facs="P25_TL00053"/>instruments. Slowly, and from the principles which rule all these instruments some<lb facs="P25_TL00054"/>better instrument will be made.<lb facs="P25_TL00055"/>I am guided in the making of mine by only the very first and simplest thoughts which I am<lb facs="P25_TL00056"/>able to see in movement. The subtleties and the complicated beauties contained in movement<lb facs="P25_TL00057"/>as it is seen in nature, these I dare not consider; I do not think I shall ever be able to<lb facs="P25_TL00058"/>hope to approach these. Yet that does not discourage me from attempting some of the<lb facs="P25_TL00059"/>plainest, barest and simplest movements,.... I mean those which seem to me the simplest,</ab>

And after I have given activity to those I suppose I<lb facs="P26_TL00003"/>shall be permitted to continue to give activity to the like of them; but 1am entirely conscious<lb facs="P26_TL00004"/>that they contain but the simplest of rhythms.... the great movements will not yet be<lb facs="P26_TL00005"/>captured,no, not for thousands of years. But when they come, great health comes with<lb facs="P26_TL00006"/>them, for we shall be nearer balance than we have ever been before.<lb facs="P26_TL00007"/>I think that movement can be divided into two distinct parts,.... the movement of two and<lb facs="P26_TL00008"/>four which is the square, the movement of one and three which is the circle. There is<lb facs="P26_TL00009"/>ever that which is masculine in the square and ever that which is feminine in the circle.<lb facs="P26_TL00010"/>And it seems to me that before the female spirit gives herself up, and with the male goes<lb facs="P26_TL00011"/>in quest of this vast treasure, perfect movement will not be discovered; for I believe that<lb facs="P26_TL00012"/>as only the male can conceive and can control that which is contained within the square,<lb facs="P26_TL00013"/>only the female can discover that which is contained in the circle.<lb facs="P26_TL00014"/>1 like to suppose that this art which shall spring from movement will be the first and final<lb facs="P26_TL00015"/>Belief of the world; and 1 like to dream that for the first [time in the world men and women<lb facs="P26_TL00016"/>will achieve this thing together. £? How fresh, how beautiful it would be! £/ And as this<lb facs="P26_TL00017"/>is a new beginning it lies before men and before women of the next centuries as a vast<lb facs="P26_TL00018"/>possibility. In men and women there is a far greater sense of movement than of music.<lb facs="P26_TL00019"/>Can it be that this idea which comes to me now will at some future date blossom through<lb facs="P26_TL00020"/>help of the woman, or will it be as ever the man's part to master these things alone? <lb facs="P26_TL00021"/>The musician is a male, the builder is a male, the painter is a male, and the poet is a male.<lb facs="P26_TL00022"/>Come now, here is an opportunity to change all this.... But 1 cannot follow the thoughts<lb facs="P26_TL00023"/>any further here, neither will you be able to.<lb facs="P26_TL00024"/>Get on with the thought of the invention of an instrument by which means you can bring<lb facs="P26_TL00025"/>movement before our eyes. &amp; When you have reached this point in your developments you<lb facs="P26_TL00026"/>need have no further fear of hiding your feeling or your opinion, but may step forward and<lb facs="P26_TL00027"/>join me in the search. You will not be a revolutionary against the theatre, for you will<lb facs="P26_TL00028"/>have risen above the theatre and entered into something beyond it. &amp; Maybe you will pursue<lb facs="P26_TL00029"/>a scientific method in your search, and that will lead to very valuable results. &amp; There must<lb facs="P26_TL00030"/>be a hundred roads leading to this point, not merely one, and a scientific demonstration of<lb facs="P26_TL00031"/>all that you may discover can in no way harm this thing. Well, do you see any value<lb facs="P26_TL00032"/>in the thing 1 give you ?

                                    <lb facs="P29_TL00005"/>| n Sarah Bernhardt we have the perfect actress. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P29_TL00006"/>She seems to have set out to become perfect in her work and we find she has accomplished<lb facs="P29_TL00007"/>the task. This can be said of no other woman upon the stage, and, now Irving is no<lb facs="P29_TL00008"/>more, it can be said of no man. Therefore she stands alone in being alone able of all living<lb facs="P29_TL00009"/>persons to give a perfect exhibition af acting. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P29_TL00010"/>&amp; In achieving so difficult, and, one might almost say, so unpleasant, a task, she has shown<lb facs="P29_TL00011"/>us that she possesses a directness of purpose which would be remarkable in a man, still<lb facs="P29_TL00012"/>more remarkable in a woman, and extraordinary in an actress. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P29_TL00013"/>&amp; Thirty years ago she was the first actress in the world and she has kept her place, for she<lb facs="P29_TL00014"/>has advanced as all the others advanced upon her. Her performance in "La Dame aux<lb facs="P29_TL00015"/>Camelias " is today a more perfect thing than it was twenty years ago. We may therefore<lb facs="P29_TL00016"/>say that she is now in her prime. But even this is uncertain. We are not sure that she<lb facs="P29_TL00017"/>will not go further. If another and a younger actress should appear and it should be in<lb facs="P29_TL00018"/>question as to which of the two were the greater, Sarah Bernhardt would advance upon her<lb facs="P29_TL00019"/>present position and would tell us. &amp; She is firmly persuaded of her power. &amp;<lb facs="P29_TL00020"/>&amp; I am one whom it interests but little to go to the theatre for I find there all the signs of<lb facs="P29_TL00021"/>weakness in art—indecision of thought and incompleteness of utterance. The actor is<lb facs="P29_TL00022"/>grandiloquent .or he is amusing; he is easy or he is well dressed or he is handsome* The<lb facs="P29_TL00023"/>actresses are charming, even fascinating, are self possessed, speak well, or are excellent<lb facs="P29_TL00024"/>mimics. In some cases they exhibit some depth of emotion. £&gt; Some actresses cry well,<lb facs="P29_TL00025"/>have most bewitching tears in their voice, convey the feeling of great sadness or are<lb facs="P29_TL00026"/>entirely merry. Some are even delightful comedians, are touching and pathetic: and<lb facs="P29_TL00027"/>some are very womanly. And Bernhardt is every bit of all this before she begins, and<lb facs="P29_TL00028"/>when she begins we are aware that we are about to see a piece of superlative acting.<lb facs="P29_TL00029"/>jg* If it is Bernhardt that she always acts, she has been careful during her life to see<lb facs="P29_TL00030"/>that Bernhardt was everything. Therefore she is not merely a happy spirit, or unhappy, she<lb facs="P29_TL00031"/>is both. She is not merely a pleasant temperament nor merely a grim temperament; she is<lb facs="P29_TL00032"/>both. She alone has seen that to be the perfect actress you must be a perfectly developed<lb facs="P29_TL00033"/>woman. &amp; To most celebrated actresses who are their own managers their task is<lb facs="P29_TL00034"/>a tedious one. They shirk three quarters of it. They compromise with what they<lb facs="P29_TL00035"/>find objectionable in the task and so they are left behind. They seem to me to<lb facs="P29_TL00036"/>be weary, and that is what Bernhardt never seems to be. I have read of her<lb facs="P29_TL00037"/>extraordinary capability of being able to work continuously for eighteen or twenty<lb facs="P29_TL00038"/>hours or longer, passing from one thing to another with a fresh zest and with clear energy.<lb facs="P29_TL00039"/>But I, who have myself had some work for a few years in connection with the theatre, and<lb facs="P29_TL00040"/>know what a confusion is apt to reign there, know that what has been stated of her<lb facs="P29_TL00041"/>capabilities as director has been understated. She has borne the stress of laborious hours<lb facs="P29_TL00042"/>well enough, but what she has borne with best and brought under her control are the doubts<lb facs="P29_TL00043"/>which must have assailed her as to the value of her task. &amp; x?<lb facs="P29_TL00044"/>All actors and actresses talk much about the Art of Acting, but many of these confess by<lb facs="P29_TL00045"/>their work their doubt as to whether it is an art, and a thankful art. Some of them act<lb facs="P29_TL00046"/>unwillingly, some of them seem to have much trouble with those things which surround them<lb facs="P29_TL00047"/>while at work and which they speak of as being something apart from their art; that is to say, the<lb facs="P29_TL00048"/>work of their fellow actors, the play, the scenery, and so on. But with Bernhardt this is not so.<lb facs="P29_TL00049"/>I daresay she has not only never been heard to sigh at her work, but has actually never<lb facs="P29_TL00050"/>felt weariness nor regret. To her Life is work, and she is a stern master,... above all to herself.<lb facs="P29_TL00051"/>She never allows herself to shirk difficulties. The play or the scene may not have for her an<lb facs="P29_TL00052"/>undue value, but what value they have to her as actress she is always ready to credit them with,<lb facs="P29_TL00053"/>I should say that she alone is true in her just admiration of her fellow actors, of the scene painter<lb facs="P29_TL00054"/>and of the programme printer. I should say that she alone rightly values the work of these<lb facs="P29_TL00055"/>men. What is a programme to most great actors or actresses? Quite an extra affair.<lb facs="P29_TL00056"/>With Sarah Bernhardt it is part of a whole, part of herself; and 1 suppose that not one programme<lb facs="P29_TL00057"/>has been issued in her theatre that has not come under her direct and careful supervision.<lb facs="P29_TL00058"/>Now when we consider this, and when we remember that the programme, the last thing</ab>

And<lb facs="P30_TL00006"/>remember this; that the great statesman or the great admiral, the great field marshall or<lb facs="P30_TL00007"/>the head of a university, have under them a trained staff of experts. Not so in the theatre,<lb facs="P30_TL00008"/>not so Madame Sarah Bernhardt.<lb facs="P30_TL00009"/>Consider then for a moment what this means. It means that she has to play the part<lb facs="P30_TL00010"/>which a general has to play when he is trapped and besieged in a town in a foreign land<lb facs="P30_TL00011"/>and with none but native soldiers under him. The world rings with the stories of how<lb facs="P30_TL00012"/>this or that general fought against such odds, has had to manufacture his guns without<lb facs="P30_TL00013"/>sufficient men to erect them, has had to put up with countless makeshifts; and then he is<lb facs="P30_TL00014"/>decorated for his adroitness, his energy and his bravery. And justly too. Those who go<lb facs="P30_TL00015"/>to the theatre know nothing of the odds against which such as Bernhardt has to fight. They<lb facs="P30_TL00016"/>do not know that there are any difficulties out of the common which have had to be overcome.<lb facs="P30_TL00017"/>They do not know of the tremendous odds against the production of even a fairly good<lb facs="P30_TL00018"/>representation. They do not know that the stage of a Theatre is an antiquated and useless<lb facs="P30_TL00019"/>machine. Therefore let us all praise Bernhardt for her remarkable achievement under<lb facs="P30_TL00020"/>the most astounding obstacles. She has spent her fortunes to crown the name of actress*<lb facs="P30_TL00021"/>manager and if there is a better actress than herself to whom the crown should go, such a<lb facs="P30_TL00022"/>one has not yet appeared. We call to mind the names of one or two more actresses who<lb facs="P30_TL00023"/>have from time to time created great and lasting impressions, by their performances, and in<lb facs="P30_TL00024"/>adjudging the crown to Sarah Bernhardt we in no way give way in our admiration for the<lb facs="P30_TL00025"/>performances of these unique beings. But there are weak places in these others. They<lb facs="P30_TL00026"/>are not all " actress At times they are so much more women; at other times they are<lb facs="P30_TL00027"/>so much more children. Bernhardt is the only actress who is complete at all points, and<lb facs="P30_TL00028"/>that because of her character. &amp;<lb facs="P30_TL00029"/>&amp; Some there are who say that the art of the Theatre is no longer known to us, that it<lb facs="P30_TL00030"/>departed with the Greeks and that a long time must elapse before it returns to us. Others<lb facs="P30_TL00031"/>there are who begin to see the signs of a Renaissance. But after all has been recorded<lb facs="P30_TL00032"/>of the past and all foreshadowed of the future, when we regard the present with its<lb facs="P30_TL00033"/>theatre of vulgarity, its theatre of commerce and its theatre of the emotional personality,<lb facs="P30_TL00034"/>we must all hail Sarah Bernhardt as the most courageous and successful traveller, in that</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P30_TL00042"/>Jt was lately stated in the Journals that your interest in the best cause of the Theatre has<lb facs="P30_TL00043"/>been awakened. That must mean that you do not look upon the theatre in the same<lb facs="P30_TL00044"/>light as one looks on a means for making a fortune, but that you recognise in the theatre<lb facs="P30_TL00045"/>a force, which can make for great good or great evil. The men who in their first<lb facs="P30_TL00046"/>enthusiasm throw their lives into the theatre, do so very often in the belief that it is a<lb facs="P30_TL00047"/>glorious place of enchantment and that the stories they have heard about its degrading<lb facs="P30_TL00048"/>influence are old grandmothers' tales. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P30_TL00049"/>I have seen very many such cases, and in each case the bad influence has prevailed<lb facs="P30_TL00050"/>and they lose their liberty, enthusiasm and sense of enchantment; they become vain, ignorantly<lb facs="P30_TL00051"/>selfish, and live in an atmosphere which can be described as the opposite of intelligent.<lb facs="P30_TL00052"/>Of Art the Theatre knows and teaches nothing; therefore these men who enter the Theatre<lb facs="P30_TL00053"/>hopefully soon abandon that hope. &amp; It takes but few years of this life to rob each man<lb facs="P30_TL00054"/>of his Ideals and his courage. He then either degenerates to an out~at=elbows actor or rises<lb facs="P30_TL00055"/>to the unenviable position of a modern actor manager. To succeed (that is to say to win a<lb facs="P30_TL00056"/>Succes de theatre) a man must compromise his every ideal and must be content with an<lb facs="P30_TL00057"/>insecure but flashily effective external success. It is unnecessary to remind you that in<lb facs="P30_TL00058"/>Literature, Music and Painting the only success to be won is without compromise and<lb facs="P30_TL00059"/>by faithfully serving the purest and sweetest principles of Art. It is unnecessary to speak<lb facs="P30_TL00060"/>at length of Leonardo, (liotto and the choir of angelic fellows, Donafello, Mantegna, Botticelli,<lb facs="P30_TL00061"/>Bach, Gluck, Beethoven—all of whom refused to compromise and who have hated and rehated<lb facs="P30_TL00062"/>all that the modern Actor Manager offers the world as works of Art.

                                    <lb facs="P31_TL00002"/>men of the Theatre who have preserved their Ideals as artists and have known none who have<lb facs="P31_TL00003"/>remained faithful to them. It may therefore be truthfully stated that no work of Art of the<lb facs="P31_TL00004"/>Theatre is today being produced, because there are no men fitted to produce a work of Art.<lb facs="P31_TL00005"/>This is the position of the art and institution which you courageously propose to assist.<lb facs="P31_TL00006"/>The theatre has gone down and down until it has reached the lowest possible point of<lb facs="P31_TL00007"/>degeneracy. Doctors propose inadequate remedies. Some of the cures proposed are courageous<lb facs="P31_TL00008"/>but unintelligent. One would save the Art by the introduction of music into the theatre.<lb facs="P31_TL00009"/>Thus we have a heroic Wagner wrestling with the impossible. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00010"/>Another would call Literature to its aid, another Painting. All these are no remedies. All<lb facs="P31_TL00011"/>these things only make the patient less self-reliant, and more irritable. The remedy lies in<lb facs="P31_TL00012"/>no outside aid; it lies in the patient himself. His spirit is underfoot, it needs raising to his<lb facs="P31_TL00013"/>heart and head line. He is as a man who dreams he is ill. He has by nature as healthy a<lb facs="P31_TL00014"/>constitution as another, but he has lost his will to think so and his will to take arms against<lb facs="P31_TL00015"/>his sea of troubles.<lb facs="P31_TL00016"/>If then the theatre is to emerge from its present unhealthy and undignified position it must<lb facs="P31_TL00017"/>do so by the power of its own spirit, that is to say, by the power of its own Art. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00018"/>In a book which appeared in 1905 Mr. Gordon Craig stated some of the conclusions he had<lb facs="P31_TL00019"/>arrived at after years of practical experience and study of the whole question of the theatre<lb facs="P31_TL00020"/>and its disease. He lightly touched on several points which 1 understand he is treating in<lb facs="P31_TL00021"/>greater detail in a very much larger book that he is now preparing. &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00022"/>One of the points he omitted to write about was the need of a college for the technical<lb facs="P31_TL00023"/>study of the Art of the Theatre. He omitted to touch on this subject for reasons; the first<lb facs="P31_TL00024"/>being that at the time the book appeared there were several schools for acting in existence,<lb facs="P31_TL00025"/>all of which were parodies of the great school which such a study deserves. These schools<lb facs="P31_TL00026"/>were run either to make money or to obtain young actors and actresses for London or<lb facs="P31_TL00027"/>provincial companies, giving them six months or a year's training, and if any showed<lb facs="P31_TL00028"/>aptitude as an actor or actress they would be instantly given a position in a London or<lb facs="P31_TL00029"/>provincial theatre. In fact the shortness of the training given and received was such as<lb facs="P31_TL00030"/>would not even be sufficient to qualify a domestic servant for a situation, much less a man<lb facs="P31_TL00031"/>who is to master the first principal of a very difficult craft.... that of acting. &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00032"/>&amp; Mr Craig therefore feared to speak at all in his book of a school lest his readers should<lb facs="P31_TL00033"/>instantly jump to the conclusion that he advocated any existing school; and he could not<lb facs="P31_TL00034"/>openly attack any of these as he had attempted to form an ideal school of his own, and had<lb facs="P31_TL00035"/>for the moment failed. His school proposed to instruct scholars in the whole Art of the Theatre:<lb facs="P31_TL00036"/>not alone in the craft of acting but that of all the divisions such as scene, costume, movement,<lb facs="P31_TL00037"/>voice and the larger study of the relationship of one craft to another. He was obliged to<lb facs="P31_TL00038"/>relinquish this task for a while for he soon realised that the scholars must not only receive<lb facs="P31_TL00039"/>free tuition but must also be supported free of charge, and this was beyond his powers. He<lb facs="P31_TL00040"/>also found out that those pupils who could pay his fee belonged to an indolent class<lb facs="P31_TL00041"/>who brought with them little energy, and less talent or intelligence; the right intelligence<lb facs="P31_TL00042"/>he found lay in the poorer classes. A further discovery was that out of 50 applications 43 or 45<lb facs="P31_TL00043"/>of these would be women.... women who wanted something to do to pass the time: the<lb facs="P31_TL00044"/>young men who would have joined were obliged, much against their natural inclination, to<lb facs="P31_TL00045"/>accept offices either as clerks or as journalists, as commercial travellers or some such task<lb facs="P31_TL00046"/>demanding the regularity of the machine. They could not afford to be doing work which<lb facs="P31_TL00047"/>would bring them no immediate income. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00048"/>&amp; It is, I think, quite obvious that the theatre will regain its vitality through the men and<lb facs="P31_TL00049"/>not through the women, although some of the latter can be relied on to a great extent;<lb facs="P31_TL00050"/>for the whole science of the stage demands an amount of concentration and tenacity of<lb facs="P31_TL00051"/>purpose which men are better able to bring to it than womeu. A school such as I have<lb facs="P31_TL00052"/>hinted at would do much towards eradicating the terrible cancer which preys upon the<lb facs="P31_TL00053"/>modern stage.... that is to say, ignorant vanity, which leads to intrigue and insubordination.<lb facs="P31_TL00054"/>Such vanity can be eradicated by systematic knowledge and culture, and these are only to be<lb facs="P31_TL00055"/>acquired by a long and patient devotion to the principles of the art and a complete and original<lb facs="P31_TL00056"/>study of the technic of the stage. Such a study would bring to the pupil a sense of the great<lb facs="P31_TL00057"/>beauty which still lies fresh at the heart of the great art which now looks so withered.<lb facs="P31_TL00058"/>In 1880 Mr Ruskin wrote as follows of the theatre as Institution; 44 Yes, 1 began writing</ab>

The actor managers of London seem to be<lb facs="P32_TL00015"/>most ignorant of the beauty and the nobility of their trust, although they never cease to speak<lb facs="P32_TL00016"/>to the poorer actors about the honour of their calling. The peculiar and individual nature<lb facs="P32_TL00017"/>of the art of the theatre is not recognised by them and the theatre is in danger of being<lb facs="P32_TL00018"/>confounded with the curiosity shop. And not only in England but in America, in Germany,<lb facs="P32_TL00019"/>France, Russia, Italy and Holland is this danger imminent. &amp; In Germany there are two<lb facs="P32_TL00020"/>theatres; the State theatre and the private theatre. The former is in the proudly ludicrous<lb facs="P32_TL00021"/>position of active inactivity; it walks while it sleeps and is a danger to itself and the community.<lb facs="P32_TL00022"/>The latter is an energetic theatre eager to learn all that is to be learned, but like the child<lb facs="P32_TL00023"/>it culls in its ignorance all the blossoms it can lay hands on and plants them in the<lb facs="P32_TL00024"/>mould expecting to see them take root and instantly bear fruit. The Dutch theatre is<lb facs="P32_TL00025"/>entirely stagnant. The theatre of Russia resembles the German theatre and has two divisions.<lb facs="P32_TL00026"/>The state theatre slumbers and the theatre of private enterprise although extremely virile is<lb facs="P32_TL00027"/>monstrously Realistic (a sure sign of degeneration). I quote what has been written elsewhere<lb facs="P32_TL00028"/>about this question of Realism in the theatre as it illuminates a dark &amp; dangerous corner. &amp;<lb facs="P32_TL00029"/>44 The modern Realistic Theatre forgetful of all the laws of Art, sets out to reflect the times.<lb facs="P32_TL00030"/>44 —It reflects a small particle of the times—It drags back a curtain and exposes to our view<lb facs="P32_TL00031"/>44 an agitated caricature of Man and his Life—A figure gross in its attitude and hideous to<lb facs="P32_TL00032"/>44 look upon. This is neither true to Life nor to Art. It has never been the purpose of<lb facs="P32_TL00033"/>44 Art to reflect and make uglier the ugliness of things—but to transform and make the already<lb facs="P32_TL00034"/>44 beautiful, more beautiful—and in following this purpose, Art shields us with sweet influences<lb facs="P32_TL00035"/>44 from the dark sorrows of our jg? &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P32_TL00036"/>44 The modern Realistic Theatre helps to stir up in the people that Restlessness which is<lb facs="P32_TL00037"/>44 the enemy of all things. Realism contains the seeds of Revolt and however much the<lb facs="P32_TL00038"/>44 heart of the man may lean with sympathy towards those whom fate seems to follow relentlessly<lb facs="P32_TL00039"/>44 the artist must never lend his art, with its terrible power of appeal, towards the destruction of<lb facs="P32_TL00040"/>44 that just Balance which it is the aim of mankind to preserve. For there is no poison<lb facs="P32_TL00041"/>44 more swift than this which eats in to the mind—this false witnessing Realism—this traitor<lb facs="P32_TL00042"/>44 to the Imagination—this idolatry of ugliness to which the Realistic theatre would compel us.<lb facs="P32_TL00043"/>44 Daring and dangerous—it is a Revolt against the very Laws of the Art of the Theatre.<lb facs="P32_TL00044"/>44 Daring because to REPRODUCE nature is an impossibility, Dangerous because it is a threat<lb facs="P32_TL00045"/>44 against the well ordered life of the Citizen. Each whisper of Revolt finds an echo in the<lb facs="P32_TL00046"/>44 theatre—the gloomy expressions, the shuffling movements—the dark and closed in scenes—<lb facs="P32_TL00047"/>44 the spasmodic exclamations of the actors—the strange muffled atmosphere—all these things<lb facs="P32_TL00048"/>44 lend themselves to form one sinister impression<lb facs="P32_TL00049"/>&amp; Ruskin also has a word of warning to the theatre against this tendency; 44 The modern<lb facs="P32_TL00050"/>44 stage is ruined by its realisation of scenery which is contrary to all noble art. A picture,<lb facs="P32_TL00051"/>44 whether on canvass or on the stage, should give us an idea, not its realisation &amp;<lb facs="P32_TL00052"/>&amp; 1 have spoken of the several theatres of Europe because if you are going to put your power<lb facs="P32_TL00053"/>in the balance against the monstrous modern tendencies, and wish to awaken a fresh and<lb facs="P32_TL00054"/>practical hope in the younger artists of the theatre 1 believe you will have to consider the question<lb facs="P32_TL00055"/>from an International point of view. 1 believe that your studies in this direction will bring<lb facs="P32_TL00056"/>you to the point which I have touched upon here; that is to say, that a great college is the first<lb facs="P32_TL00057"/>necessity; such a college to have branches in all the European &amp; American states so that men<lb facs="P32_TL00058"/>(not women, by the way) may be trained all over the Earth, who will, after many years,<lb facs="P32_TL00059"/>unite the great capitals of Europe and America by means of an art which has in it the</ab>

Godwin published in " The Architect " a series of articles entitled "The<lb facs="P33_TL00007"/>Architecture and Costume of Shakespeare's Plays. " These articles, so far as we know,<lb facs="P33_TL00008"/>have never been reprinted, neither have they received the acknowledgement due to them.<lb facs="P33_TL00009"/>Written at a period when stage production was anything but correct in matters of detail,<lb facs="P33_TL00010"/>they have ever since then proved of great value to the play producers of the London Theatres.<lb facs="P33_TL00011"/>Sir Henry Irving, Mr Beerbohm Tree, Mr Augustus Daly, were greatly indebted to the<lb facs="P33_TL00012"/>author, who may be said to be practically the founder of a very successful period in<lb facs="P33_TL00013"/>theatrical production.<lb facs="P33_TL00014"/>Whether his teaching has been followed with as much reserve as he wished, and whether<lb facs="P33_TL00015"/>his fund of knowledge will prove of use to the Art of the Theatre, are matters into<lb facs="P33_TL00016"/>which we cannot enter here.<lb facs="P33_TL00017"/>We would like, however, to draw special attention to the date of these articles and also<lb facs="P33_TL00018"/>to the fact that the author produced the Merchant of Venice at the Prince of Wales Theatre<lb facs="P33_TL00019"/>in the same year, 1875. Some idea of the impression created by this production upon the<lb facs="P33_TL00020"/>minds of the audience at that time can be gathered from the words of Mr Beerbohm Tree,, who,<lb facs="P33_TL00021"/>in his able address to the Oxford Union Debating Society in 1900 stated that "it was the<lb facs="P33_TL00022"/>first production in which the modern spirit of stage=management asserted itself, transporting<lb facs="P33_TL00023"/>us, as it did, into the atmosphere of Venice, into the rarified realms of Shakespearean Comedy.<lb facs="P33_TL00024"/>" Since then," he proceeds, "no doubt millions have flocked to this class of production.

MSS., No 7,333 written in the reign of Henry VI. In the<lb facs="P33_TL00033"/>old story there is nothing to show that the merchant who demands the flesh as the forfeiture<lb facs="P33_TL00034"/>of the bond is a Jew, and in the tale of the Three Caskets it is a woman, and not a man,<lb facs="P33_TL00035"/>who makes the fortunate selection. Both tales, doubtless, have descended from an eastern<lb facs="P33_TL00036"/>source, and no more belong to the " Gesta Romanorum, " or even to the fourteenth century<lb facs="P33_TL00037"/>MS., "II Pecorone, " (1) than they do to the " Percy Ballads, " or to Shakespeare. No doubt<lb facs="P33_TL00038"/>can exist as to the time of the action. The text contains no reference of any kind to any<lb facs="P33_TL00039"/>thing outside the author's personal knowledge, and no mention of any office or person which<lb facs="P33_TL00040"/>could connect the play with any other period than that in which it was written. The<lb facs="P33_TL00041"/>improbabilities—I may say impossibilities—of these two fictions having any foundation in the<lb facs="P33_TL00042"/>history of any European city during the sixteenth century are self=evident. The very dawn<lb facs="P33_TL00043"/>of commercial enterprise would be even too late for the two great barbaric events of the<lb facs="P33_TL00044"/>play—the fiesh«forfeit and the trial by casket. In fact, the Merchant of Venice, as far as its<lb facs="P33_TL00045"/>double plot is concerned, but in that only, is as unreal as a drama of this nature can well<lb facs="P33_TL00046"/>be, and in this respect affords a striking contrast to the realism of Othello. There remains,<lb facs="P33_TL00047"/>therefore, not a shadow of a reason for placing the date of the action earlier than 1590, a<lb facs="P33_TL00048"/>quite possible date for the dramatic creation, or later than 1598, the actual date of its entry<lb facs="P33_TL00049"/>at Stationers' Hall. (2) For a reason, which will appear hereafter, I take the year 1590 as the<lb facs="P33_TL00050"/>date best suited for the stage representation of this play. The season of the year is manifestly<lb facs="P33_TL00051"/>neither summer nor winter; it is certainly not dark before 4 p. m. in summer, even in a<lb facs="P33_TL00052"/>narrow Venetian street, and in winter Jessica and Lorenzo would scarcely sit on grass banks<lb facs="P33_TL00053"/>at midnight. Again, a small farmer or miller, be his name Gobbo or anything else, would<lb facs="P33_TL00054"/>have more respect for his birds than to kill them in spring time; and so we may reasonably<lb facs="P33_TL00055"/>accept the three months of autumn as the time of the action.<lb facs="P33_TL00056"/>The architectural scenery, divided between Venice and Belmont, may be said to consist, at<lb facs="P33_TL00057"/>the most, of five scenes, viz.:</ab>

If there were choice flowering<lb facs="P34_TL00018"/>shrubs placed in this room so that the lady and her maid might busy themselves about them<lb facs="P34_TL00019"/>while they are conversing, and if a corridor at the back of the hall led from some other<lb facs="P34_TL00020"/>part of the house into the garden, so that one might pass the hall of the caskets without<lb facs="P34_TL00021"/>necessarily entering it, there is nothing in the text of these two scenes inconsistent with their<lb facs="P34_TL00022"/>being located in the same room as the more important casket scenes. The scene in the<lb facs="P34_TL00023"/>above list marked 5, although described as a garden in Act iii. Sc. 5, and an avenue in<lb facs="P34_TL00024"/>Act v., ought to be more or less architectural. If we wish still further to abridge our stock<lb facs="P34_TL00025"/>of scenery, the scenes Nos. 1 and 2 may be easily made one, and we shall thus have brought<lb facs="P34_TL00026"/>the play into the compass of four set scenes.</ab>

And now, as to the architecture. &amp;<lb facs="P34_TL00045"/>It is essential first of all that the scene-painter should bear well in mind that in 1590 Venice<lb facs="P34_TL00046"/>was neither a city of palaces nor a cityr of ruins, and that along her canals and streets<lb facs="P34_TL00047"/>two great styles of art, broadly speaking, prevailed, and a third was gradually usurping the<lb facs="P34_TL00048"/>place of both; these three styles were the Byzantine, the Gothic, and the Renaissance. To<lb facs="P34_TL00049"/>the first belong the great church of St. Mark, the churches of Murano and Torcello, sundry<lb facs="P34_TL00050"/>palaces, notably the Ca7 Farsetti, the Ca7 Loredan, the Fondaco de7 Turchi, and a small<lb facs="P34_TL00051"/>house in the Rio de Ca7 Foscari. To the second belong the church of the Frari, and those<lb facs="P34_TL00052"/>of SS. Giovanni e Paolo, the Madonna dell'Orto, St. Stephano, and others, as well as a<lb facs="P34_TL00053"/>perfect crowd of palaces and houses, of which those of the Doge, the Foscari, the Giustiniani,<lb facs="P34_TL00054"/>the Palazzo Badoer, the Palazzo Cicogna, the Palazzo Persico, and the Ca7 d7Oro are<lb facs="P34_TL00055"/>characteristic examples. To the third belong the Scuola of St. Mark, that of St. Rocco, the<lb facs="P34_TL00056"/>Inner court of the Ducal Palace, and among the many houses of this style we may especially<lb facs="P34_TL00057"/>note those of the Grimani, the Vandramini, the Cornaro, the Trevisano, the Camerlinghi,<lb facs="P34_TL00058"/>the Library of St. Mark, and lastly the canal front of the prison begun in 1589. Broadly<lb facs="P34_TL00059"/>speaking, this last»mentioned style obtained from as early as 1485; the Gothic style prevailed<lb facs="P34_TL00060"/>during the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, overlapping the early Renaissance<lb facs="P34_TL00061"/>even to as late as the sixteenth century, and the Byzantine takes us back two hundred<lb facs="P34_TL00062"/>years more through the twelfth century palace, Fondaco de7 Turchi. to the basilica of Torcello,<lb facs="P34_TL00063"/>built in 1,000, and the church of St. Mark founded in 977.<lb facs="P34_TL00064"/>in the compass of a short Paper, and without help from illustrations, it is quite impossible</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P37_TL00002"/>to give any notion of the great variety of fenestration and detail seen in the rise, development,<lb facs="P37_TL00003"/>and fall of Venetian Gothic from the semi-Byzantine severity of the uncusped stilted arches<lb facs="P37_TL00004"/>of transitional examples, through simple pointed work of even greater severity, having a<lb facs="P37_TL00005"/>strong likeness to the refined early Gothic of Verona, down to the full establishment of the<lb facs="P37_TL00006"/>O.G, headed opening, ranged at first singly and in small groups, then extended and combined<lb facs="P37_TL00007"/>with tracery, once large and noble, as in the early fourteenth century work of the Doge's<lb facs="P37_TL00008"/>palace and in a small house near the Ca' d'Oro, but finally wearing itself out in weak<lb facs="P37_TL00009"/>reiteration. Photographs of the old houses of Venice are so readily to be had, that the<lb facs="P37_TL00010"/>only difficulty left to a scene-painter is the archaeological one—that of recognising any<lb facs="P37_TL00011"/>deductions or additions in detail that may have been made to any Mediaeval house since 1590.<lb facs="P37_TL00012"/>Moreover, the red brick of Venice is full of such charming colour, and the weather stains<lb facs="P37_TL00013"/>upon the stone and marble give such delicious tone to these materials, that one hesitates<lb facs="P37_TL00014"/>to write a word that would tend to dispel the vision. <lb facs="P37_TL00015"/>But yet, if we desire to realise the Venice of Shakespeare, we shall have to cover most of the<lb facs="P37_TL00016"/>brick with veneer of marble, either plain or in coloured diaper, or with stucco decorated<lb facs="P37_TL00017"/>with painted diapers, and the few exceptions to this rule would be the very smallest and<lb facs="P37_TL00018"/>poorest houses and the earliest of the Byzantine works. Again, the weather stains on a<lb facs="P37_TL00019"/>traceried palace of 1450 would be very different in 1590 from what they were in 1870. Besides,<lb facs="P37_TL00020"/>Venice was then in the full swing of the pride of life, and the very notion of decay or<lb facs="P37_TL00021"/>dilapidation must have been hateful to her, all the more hateful from an occasional gleam<lb facs="P37_TL00022"/>of consciousness that her power was already rapidly decaying and that her pride, satisfaction<lb facs="P37_TL00023"/>and self-sufficiency were hastening her, as they had hastened other States (and as they may<lb facs="P37_TL00024"/>in the end bring ours) to utter and irretrievable ruin. Another point for the scene-painter<lb facs="P37_TL00025"/>to bear in mind is that the streets and open places were usually paved with red brick<lb facs="P37_TL00026"/>arranged in simple patterns, and most commonly in that known as herring-bone. Such, Mr.<lb facs="P37_TL00027"/>Lonsdale tells me, was the original pavement under the arches of the Ducal Palace which<lb facs="P37_TL00028"/>he happened to see some few years ago, when excavation was being made round the<lb facs="P37_TL00029"/>foundations of one of the pillars.<lb facs="P37_TL00030"/>A third very important thing to remember in connection with the Venice of the merchant<lb facs="P37_TL00031"/>Antonio is the universality of applied colour as distinguished from the parti-coloured<lb facs="P37_TL00032"/>construction adopted by the rest of Western Europe. The coloured marble pattern on the<lb facs="P37_TL00033"/>Ducal Palace was by no means a solitary example; indeed there is still to be seen<lb facs="P37_TL00034"/>on another building, in the Grand Canal a pattern very like it and the Ca'd'Gro's red-and<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P37_TL00035"/>white square marble diaper was at one time far from being singular. In houses of less<lb facs="P37_TL00036"/>pretension the stucco was painted in two or three simple earth colours, with small diapers,<lb facs="P37_TL00037"/>one of these consisting of a series of quatrefoils enclosing circles with angels between the<lb facs="P37_TL00038"/>quatrefoils is figured in the second volume of Mr Ruskin's 4&lt; Stones of Venice. " Set Into<lb facs="P37_TL00039"/>this field of softened and almost natural-toned colour came the glistening white marble<lb facs="P37_TL00040"/>shafts and arches of the windows, each window or group of windows framed by an edging<lb facs="P37_TL00041"/>of marble. Gold was applied to such details as the cusps, the carving, and the edges of<lb facs="P37_TL00042"/>the mouldings; bright bits of colour nestled in the background of the sunk work, and not<lb facs="P37_TL00043"/>unfrequently medallions of porphyry and serpentine enriched the plain surfaces between the<lb facs="P37_TL00044"/>arch-line and the rectangular frame. In the smaller houses we may note that one of a group<lb facs="P37_TL00045"/>of window openings is sometimes larger than the others in the same group, and was probably<lb facs="P37_TL00046"/>so made in order to afford an entry to the balcony of convenient size.<lb facs="P37_TL00047"/>But perhaps the most characteristic element of the domestic architecture of Venice—one<lb facs="P37_TL00048"/>too which can be traced through all styles, round-arched or pointed—is the plan of the<lb facs="P37_TL00049"/>facade, which, in the vast majority of cases, was arranged with a centre and two side wings,<lb facs="P37_TL00050"/>not formed by projections, but by the centre being of such open construction as results<lb facs="P37_TL00051"/>from the use of arcades or groups of windows one over the other, and the wings built as<lb facs="P37_TL00052"/>walls pierced by single or detached windows. It should be remembered also that the old<lb facs="P37_TL00053"/>glass was usually leaded-up in circles, and other plain geometric forms, a,nd set in wood<lb facs="P37_TL00054"/>frames, with one or more cross bars fixed behind the stonework and clear of the shafts.<lb facs="P37_TL00055"/>Again the old balconies had nearly always animals or finials carved 011 the top of the<lb facs="P37_TL00056"/>projecting angles. Their boundaries, too, were by no means governed by the windows they<lb facs="P37_TL00057"/>served, for we find them extending sometimes to a portion of the group, sometimes only<lb facs="P37_TL00058"/>to the side openings, and sometimes only to the central one. &amp; &amp; &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P38_TL00007"/>Having said this much, I would venture to select for the street scene, in the diagram No,<lb facs="P38_TL00008"/>i, the following buildings as guides to the blocks indicated by the letters, A, F, G, and H;<lb facs="P38_TL00009"/>A. The Palazzo Badoer. (Painted stucco on walls.)<lb facs="P38_TL00010"/>F. The Palazzo Giusfiniani, the Fondaco de* Turchi, the Ca' d'Oro. (Showing<lb facs="P38_TL00011"/>three modes of surface ornamentation—stucco, white marble with low<lb facs="P38_TL00012"/>reliefs, and coloured marble diaper.)<lb facs="P38_TL00013"/>G. The Library of S. Mark (new white stone) or the Prison.<lb facs="P38_TL00014"/>H. The semi-Byzantine house in the Corte del Remer (marble and brick *<lb facs="P38_TL00015"/>veneered) or the work at Murano and Torcello.<lb facs="P38_TL00016"/>The next Scene I have to note is the Court of Justice. The text shows that the case of<lb facs="P38_TL00017"/>Shylock v. Antonio was one that had awakened very unusual interest even among the<lb facs="P38_TL00018"/>highest; but if the text had said nothing about the Doge and the Magnificoes Using their<lb facs="P38_TL00019"/>influence before the trial, if we had not known that Bassanio was a nobleman, Antonio a<lb facs="P38_TL00020"/>princely merchant in a city of merchants, we should still be bound to suppose that a vast<lb facs="P38_TL00021"/>public excitement must have been raised throughout the Republic from the strange nature<lb facs="P38_TL00022"/>of the horribly revengeful suit instituted by the plaintiff. Nor was this a criminal proceeding<lb facs="P38_TL00023"/>or State trial that would be likely to be heard in a private or even in a quasi-private<lb facs="P38_TL00024"/>manner, Although it might have involved a life, the case was after all nothing more than<lb facs="P38_TL00025"/>a civil action arising out of a breach of contract wherein the penalty clause was manifestly<lb facs="P38_TL00026"/>an unusual and as it happened an illegal one—a sort of thing with which nearly every<lb facs="P38_TL00027"/>modern architect is more or less familiar, Now of the various public rooms in the Palace<lb facs="P38_TL00028"/>it seems to me that the most likely place to be selected for the hearing of such a cause<lb facs="P38_TL00029"/>celebre would be the largest apartment available, for we may be quite sure that not only<lb facs="P38_TL00030"/>Tubal and Chus, but many other rich Jews, would gather round Shylock in (as they thought)<lb facs="P38_TL00031"/>his day of triumph, whilst Antonio's losses and imminent peril must have excited not only the<lb facs="P38_TL00032"/>commiseration of the State, but of every noble-minded Christian in Venice. It is because<lb facs="P38_TL00033"/>of this that I would select as the real Scene of the fourth Act the Sala del Maggior<lb facs="P38_TL00034"/>Consiglio, but as this hall measures no less than 154 by 74 feet, it is next to impossible<lb facs="P38_TL00035"/>to represent it in anything like the dignity of its true size on any stage other than<lb facs="P38_TL00036"/>exceptionally large ones. Nor can we well give a fragment of it by following the course<lb facs="P38_TL00037"/>suggested for the treatment of Westmister Abbey in the first scene of Henry VI, inasmuch<lb facs="P38_TL00038"/>as the Doge and the Magnificoes would necessarily have their seats arranged centrally in<lb facs="P38_TL00039"/>the 74 feet. Failing this room we must have recourse to the Sala dello Scrutinio—a fairly<lb facs="P38_TL00040"/>large room of the Sansovino series, decorated by the paintings of Tintoretto, Marco Vecellio,<lb facs="P38_TL00041"/>and some others of a date later than our story. Good photographs of the principal rooms<lb facs="P38_TL00042"/>in the ducal palace may be bought at a cheap rate, so that the youngest scene-painter need<lb facs="P38_TL00043"/>not err in the general architectural character of this scene. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P38_TL00044"/>The setting of it on the stage is altogether another question, and is one of the most difficult<lb facs="P38_TL00045"/>problems among the scenic questions of Shakspere's plays. We have to maintain the dignity<lb facs="P38_TL00046"/>of the strict court of Venice, to find room not only for the Doge and the Magnificoes, but<lb facs="P38_TL00047"/>for officials who might attend as senators, magistrates, doctors of law, the assessor-general,<lb facs="P38_TL00048"/>&amp;c.; we have to provide for a crowd of lawyers—some of them young men -so that Portia<lb facs="P38_TL00049"/>may not appear too singular: we must not forget the question " Which is the merchant<lb facs="P38_TL00050"/>here and which the Jew ? " showing that both plaintiff and defendant were absorbed in the<lb facs="P38_TL00051"/>two opposing crowds of Christians and Israelites; and we must remember, that although<lb facs="P38_TL00052"/>the secret tribunal of the Council of Ten had its fearful power somewhat curtailed in 1582,<lb facs="P38_TL00053"/>its servants were still to be seen watching and listening wherever two or three were<lb facs="P38_TL00054"/>gathered together. Considering all the circumstances of the case 1 again propose a diagonal<lb facs="P38_TL00055"/>set for this scene, as shown in diagram II, where M N represents the proscenium, D the<lb facs="P38_TL00056"/>raised platform for the Doge, Magnificoes, &amp;c., B the seat for Bassanio among the nobles,<lb facs="P38_TL00057"/>S and A positions of plaintiff and defendant, H Portia, F official entrance, E E public<lb facs="P38_TL00058"/>entrances, C seat for the assessor-general, 0 O halberdiers, and H group of esquires of the<lb facs="P38_TL00059"/>Doge. Now it is, 1 hope, manifest that having placed the officials and dignitaries, an<lb facs="P38_TL00060"/>enormous concourse of the general public can easily be indicated by very small (if well<lb facs="P38_TL00061"/>organised) groups near the entrances E E, especially at that near N. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P38_TL00062"/>The fittings should be of sumptuous carved wood almost covered with gilding; the chairs<lb facs="P38_TL00063"/>of the same description and of the peculiarly Venetian form then used, the seat being</ab>

Croce wrote their charming madrigal music in the second half of the sixteenth century:<lb facs="P40_TL00011"/>PaSestrina wrote in 1590 and Gironimo Converse in 1580, When the madrigals of Shakspere's<lb facs="P40_TL00012"/>time can be got at Novel!o's for ssd. each, there can be no possible excuse if the characteristic<lb facs="P40_TL00013"/>music of the age is omitted when the text or stage business suggests its introduction. &amp;<lb facs="P40_TL00014"/>But whether a theatrical manager does or does not attend to these things; whether he<lb facs="P40_TL00015"/>wishes to do right, or whether, owing to the profound ignorance respecting the manners,<lb facs="P40_TL00016"/>customs, and general surroundings of any past time which distinguishes the modern stage<lb facs="P40_TL00017"/>and its patrons," he thinks it a matter of very small moment, one thing he must do,<lb facs="P40_TL00018"/>and that is, provide three caskets. Now, for these things the style which was the most<lb facs="P40_TL00019"/>costly and the most sumptuous in the lifetime of Lady Portia's father was that introduced from<lb facs="P40_TL00020"/>Damascus, and which has always gone under the name of damascened work. Iron or steel<lb facs="P40_TL00021"/>caskets, most elaborately wrought with sharp mouldings and carvings, were covered on the<lb facs="P40_TL00022"/>plain surfaces with rich ornament pressed in of gold or silver, and in the examples before<lb facs="P40_TL00023"/>us the sides of the caskets might be pannelled, and in each panel repousse work of gold<lb facs="P40_TL00024"/>and silver for two of them, and cast work of lead for the third. It is true that armour<lb facs="P40_TL00025"/>had been damascened in the fifteenth century, but it was not until the sixteenth century<lb facs="P40_TL00026"/>that anything like high perfection was attained. The damascened iron mirror at Kensington<lb facs="P40_TL00027"/>(bought for 1,2811.) was manufactured at Milan about 1550 for the royal family of Savoy,<lb facs="P40_TL00028"/>and it seems to me quite unnecessary to adduce any further instance in proof of the very<lb facs="P40_TL00029"/>high position maintained by the damascene artists. Fair Portia's counterfeit that Bassanio<lb facs="P40_TL00030"/>takes from the leaden casket would be probably enclosed in a flat wide frame of the same<lb facs="P40_TL00031"/>style of art, or of walnut inlaid with rich patterns of ivory, mother-of-pearl, lapis lazuli,<lb facs="P40_TL00032"/>&amp;c.; or it might be of soft wood (willow, lime, or sycamore) elaborately carved and gilded.<lb facs="P40_TL00033"/>The table might be covered with velvet hanging down on two sides, some light Eastern<lb facs="P40_TL00034"/>fabric laid over the caskets, and the curtains made of silver or gold cloth suspended from<lb facs="P40_TL00035"/>a canopy of the same material, with cut valence fringe and tassels.<lb facs="P40_TL00036"/>The fifth Act, and indeed the whole episode of the rings, might very well be omitted in<lb facs="P40_TL00037"/>modern stage representation. The banter is of a kind which was riot unusual in Elizabethan<lb facs="P40_TL00038"/>society, but which now either falls flat from a want 9f that kind of perception which need<lb facs="P40_TL00039"/>never be supplied or gives rise to thoughts not perhaps even coarse when the state of<lb facs="P40_TL00040"/>society allows them free utterance, but bad and utterly so when it is thought proper to<lb facs="P40_TL00041"/>cover them up.

                                 <ab facs="P41_TB00004">
                                    <lb facs="P41_TL00012"/>we solicited answers from some of the students of the Theatre. We wondered whether<lb facs="P41_TL00013"/>anyone would reply in the affirmative to the second question, " In your opinion should the<lb facs="P41_TL00014"/>Actor be allowed the same liberty in his expression of the Passions as is permitted to the<lb facs="P41_TL00015"/>Writer or the Painter? for we recalled to mind the many subjects or moods which the<lb facs="P41_TL00016"/>poets and painters have treated realistically and we wondered whether anyone would hold<lb facs="P41_TL00017"/>that the same liberty should be permitted on the stage; liberty, first in choice of subject<lb facs="P41_TL00018"/>and secondly in treatment. We mean, of course, those subjects which the masters of<lb facs="P41_TL00019"/>painting and literature always chose as their favourites, those religious moments in the<lb facs="P41_TL00020"/>lives of the saints, those profane moments in the lives of the demons and those all too<lb facs="P41_TL00021"/>" human ** moments in the lives of men and women. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P41_TL00022"/>We call to mind some of those moments;—The Annunciation; The Last Supper; The Birth<lb facs="P41_TL00023"/>Of Eve; The Expulsion from Eden; The Nativity; The Crucifixion; The Agony in the Garden;<lb facs="P41_TL00024"/>The Last Judgement; The Birth of Venus; Perseus and Andromeda; Samson and Delilah;<lb facs="P41_TL00025"/>Lucretia; The Creation of Man; The Triumphs of Bacchus; The Birth of Pan; Salome and<lb facs="P41_TL00026"/>John the Baptist: Judith and Hollofernes. These questions, with the replies sent, are to<lb facs="P41_TL00027"/>be found below. We may perhaps be excused in saying that our questions are made as simple<lb facs="P41_TL00028"/>as possible, so that the mind of the English reader shall not be confused. The outcry raised in<lb facs="P41_TL00029"/>some of the English journals against the Realism of the acting of the Sicilians, and of Signora<lb facs="P41_TL00030"/>Mimi Auguglia's performances in particular gives us reason to believe that it was time to<lb facs="P41_TL00031"/>have a clear definition of what Realism in acting consists of, and whether it is a wise and<lb facs="P41_TL00032"/>beautiful thing to see upon a stage, shown in the same way as we see it in Painting and<lb facs="P41_TL00033"/>Literature. The Three Questions are as follows.<lb facs="P41_TL00034"/>I. Do you consider Realism in acting to be a frank representation<lb facs="P41_TL00035"/>of human nature? &amp;<lb facs="P41_TL00036"/>II. In your opinion should the Actor be allowed the same liberty<lb facs="P41_TL00037"/>in his expression of the Passions, as is permitted to the Writer<lb facs="P41_TL00038"/>or the Painter? &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P41_TL00039"/>III. Do you think that Realism appeals to the General Public or<lb facs="P41_TL00040"/>only to a limited section of Playgoers? £?<lb facs="P41_TL00041"/>We call to mind the wonderful books we have read: The Books of St Matthew, St Mark,<lb facs="P41_TL00042"/>St Luke and St John; the Vision of Heaven and Hell by Dante; The Temptation of St Anthony<lb facs="P41_TL00043"/>by Flaubert; The book of Genesis, The Thousand and One Nights; The story of Gargantua,<lb facs="P41_TL00044"/>and many more, and it remains for us a very grave and difficult question and one to which<lb facs="P41_TL00045"/>we can answer neither yes nor no, as to whether these should serve as themes for stage<lb facs="P41_TL00046"/>representations, no matter whether the treatment be realistic or idealistic.<lb facs="P41_TL00047"/>But because we can as yet give no answer, it makes it all the more interesting to solicit<lb facs="P41_TL00048"/>replies from those better equipped to speak. From these replies we gather that the majority<lb facs="P41_TL00049"/>are in favour of the same liberty of expression for the stage and its actors as that possessed<lb facs="P41_TL00050"/>by the painters and poets, and that they are eager to see upon the stage the frank realistic<lb facs="P41_TL00051"/>representation of plays founded on the stories from the New Testament, from the stories of<lb facs="P41_TL00052"/>Venus, Jupiter and the Deities of the ancient world, and from such themes as those treated<lb facs="P41_TL00053"/>by Correggio, Titian, Hogarth, Burns.

By "truth " and " frankness " the word " allowed" cannot appear: these things are a<lb facs="P43_TL00029"/>common right which no one can gainsay. For here nature asserts herself and establishes<lb facs="P43_TL00030"/>her right and so proclaims the " law " and real laws we obey, we cannot direct them I<lb facs="P43_TL00031"/>HI. What a question. You might as well ask if there is such a thing as a limited section<lb facs="P43_TL00032"/>of Playgoers! Shakespeare is real., if the actors are not, and does he not appeal to all. The<lb facs="P43_TL00033"/>pioneer of an unknown thing, by his discovery establishes a fact. The Sicilians can I think<lb facs="P43_TL00034"/>quote this. A figure in wax, however well it is made, does not give us the same sensations<lb facs="P43_TL00035"/>that the real thing would: or, could it be so well produced that our senses, (through the<lb facs="P43_TL00036"/>impression made upon the mind) would respond to the imitation as to the real. In any case<lb facs="P43_TL00037"/>the law, (written or unwritten) is that no imitation of whatever kind can possess the value<lb facs="P43_TL00038"/>of the real. Why then should " acting" play a better part than the rest? Art is the imitation<lb facs="P43_TL00039"/>of nature, or of man's handiwork; never can its value equal that of the real. By value<lb facs="P43_TL00040"/>one means its worth in truth, not money, for the latter misleads yesterday, today and<lb facs="P43_TL00041"/>tomorrow. There is no doubt that real feeling, really expressed, can never be replaced<lb facs="P43_TL00042"/>nor confounded by its imitation, however perfect that imitation may be. &amp; &amp;</ab>

My whole life has been given to demonstrating that the actor is an<lb facs="P43_TL00046"/>unfortunate hinderance to the Art of the Stage on account of his actuality. I have never<lb facs="P43_TL00047"/>been able to understand the illogical situation of the Modern Theatre. The wJhole Art is<lb facs="P43_TL00048"/>composed of contradictory elements. On the one hand we have verse,.... a poetic and certainly<lb facs="P43_TL00049"/>unnatural mode of speech, as in (loethe, Shakespeare, Caulderon: and on the other hand<lb facs="P43_TL00050"/>an attempted prosaic or " natural " utterance on the part of the actor. Again, we compose<lb facs="P43_TL00051"/>our scenes of unreal canvas and paint, thereby making either suggestions or imitations of<lb facs="P43_TL00052"/>actual things, and amongst these walks our real figure, by no means either a suggestion<lb facs="P43_TL00053"/>or an imitation of an actual being. The mixture of actuality and unreality creates a seme<lb facs="P43_TL00054"/>of artificiality, and this makes a parody of Art. In no Art is there a confusion of actuality<lb facs="P43_TL00055"/>and fancy. 1 could accept the actor if his surroundings were actualities, or I could accept<lb facs="P43_TL00056"/>the cardboard scenery if the figures were also cardboard. I cannot accept the two together<lb facs="P43_TL00057"/>for they create a situation which is utterly falser &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; J&amp;</ab>

One would think that Art and<lb facs="P46_TL00081"/>the Muses and the gaiety of nations were<lb facs="P46_TL00082"/>themes to set the heart loose and make us all<lb facs="P46_TL00083"/>clever, witty and happy. We know why Art<lb facs="P46_TL00084"/>came into existence,.... but the meeting at<lb facs="P46_TL00085"/>the Lyceum made us think we did not know.<lb facs="P46_TL00086"/>We were made to feel that Art ought never<lb facs="P46_TL00087"/>to be mentioned except with the permission<lb facs="P46_TL00088"/>of Mr Pinero and a few other ordinary peo=<lb facs="P46_TL00089"/>pie. &amp; Mr Pinero was terrible. He accused<lb facs="P46_TL00090"/>himself of representing the ordinary <lb facs="P46_TL00091"/>tists. Mr Shaw was present. Mr Shaw was<lb facs="P46_TL00092"/>charming: he said nothing except that, though<lb facs="P46_TL00093"/>the subject was not exhausted, he and his<lb facs="P46_TL00094"/>friends were. But he looked the only man<lb facs="P46_TL00095"/>there who could never get exhausted. He<lb facs="P46_TL00096"/>looked prepared to accept any handicap. Mr<lb facs="P46_TL00097"/>Pinero was what we should describe as dead<lb facs="P46_TL00098"/>beat. He made a gallant attempt to remain<lb facs="P46_TL00099"/>cheerful while he sneered at all things which<lb facs="P46_TL00100"/>were above the ordinary. He said some<lb facs="P46_TL00101"/>patronising things about the late Sir Henry<lb facs="P46_TL00102"/>Irving and managed to speak Mr Beerbohni<lb facs="P46_TL00103"/>Tree fair. The effort to turn this double<lb facs="P46_TL00104"/>summersault was visible, &amp;We did not see<lb facs="P46_TL00105"/>either Mr H. B.

                                       <lb facs="P47_TL00028"/>Tphe Hungarian Theatre has shown signs for<lb facs="P47_TL00029"/>a few years of renewed life. It begins to<lb facs="P47_TL00030"/>break away from the traditional artificiality<lb facs="P47_TL00031"/>which degrades the modern European Theatre.<lb facs="P47_TL00032"/>The most active leader of this movement in<lb facs="P47_TL00033"/>Budapest is Alexander Hevesi, who, like many<lb facs="P47_TL00034"/>of those now working to create a new Theatre,<lb facs="P47_TL00035"/>has served his apprenticeship under the old<lb facs="P47_TL00036"/>regime, only finally discarding it in despair<lb facs="P47_TL00037"/>of either reviving that theatre or creating<lb facs="P47_TL00038"/>in it, in its present state, any work of art.<lb facs="P47_TL00039"/>Hevesi was Stage Manager of the National<lb facs="P47_TL00040"/>Theatre for five years. Convinced both<lb facs="P47_TL00041"/>practically and theoretically that nothing<lb facs="P47_TL00042"/>artistic could be produced in the old theatre<lb facs="P47_TL00043"/>he then founded, with the assistance of some<lb facs="P47_TL00044"/>young literary men, a stage society to which<lb facs="P47_TL00045"/>he gave the name of 44 The Thalia Society ",<lb facs="P47_TL00046"/>This Society, which was not commercial in<lb facs="P47_TL00047"/>its aims, numbered among its members many<lb facs="P47_TL00048"/>ambitious and talented young actors, writers<lb facs="P47_TL00049"/>and painters, and the plays produced,<lb facs="P47_TL00050"/>unhampered by tradition, were works of a<lb facs="P47_TL00051"/>high order.

He became a<lb facs="P47_TL00055"/>Realist less from conviction than necessity,<lb facs="P47_TL00056"/>and the need was to free the old Hungarian<lb facs="P47_TL00057"/>stage from its artificiality. The study of the<lb facs="P47_TL00058"/>antique Theatre, the Theatres of Japan and<lb facs="P47_TL00059"/>India, and the history of tbe Marionette<lb facs="P47_TL00060"/>brought him to perceive that Realism, while<lb facs="P47_TL00061"/>it is the beginning, is not the end of Art. &amp;<lb facs="P47_TL00062"/>He then produced D'Annunzio's44 Citt&amp; Morta "<lb facs="P47_TL00063"/>in a freer, better manner. This he followed<lb facs="P47_TL00064"/>up by Gerhard Hauptmann's 44 Elga "i which<lb facs="P47_TL00065"/>was represented like a dream.<lb facs="P47_TL00066"/>Since this note was written less encouraging<lb facs="P47_TL00067"/>news of the 44 Thalia Society" has been<lb facs="P47_TL00068"/>received, An order from the chief Constable<lb facs="P47_TL00069"/>of Budapest has arrested, perhaps killed, the<lb facs="P47_TL00070"/>activity of the 44 Thalia Society " which has</ab>

With such<lb facs="P50_TL00109"/>a prize as a nation would offer he could<lb facs="P50_TL00110"/>afford to travel in Europe and study his art<lb facs="P50_TL00111"/>with more facility.

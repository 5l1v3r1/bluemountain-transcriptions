This is<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>why women remain children all their lives, for they always see only<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>what is near at hand, cling to the present, take the appearance of a<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>thing for reality, and prefer trifling matters to the most important. It<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>is by virtue of man's reasoning powers that he does not live in the<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>present only, like the brute, but observes and ponders over the past<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>and future; and from this spring discretion, care, and that anxiety which<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>we so frequently notice in people.

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>lectually short-sighted, for although her intuitive understanding quickly<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>perceives what is near to her, on the other hand her circle of vision is<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>limited and does not embrace anything that is remote; hence everything<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>that is absent or past, or in the future, affects women in a less degree<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>than men. This is why they have greater inclination for extravagance,<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>which sometimes borders on madness. Women in their hearts think that<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>men are intended to earn money so that they may spend It, if possible<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>during their husband's lifetime, but at any rate after his death.<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>&amp; As soon as he has given them his earnings on which to keep house<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>they are strengthened in this belief. Although all this entails many<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>disadvantages, yet it has this advantage... that -a woman lives more in<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>the present than a man, and that she enjoys it more keenly if it is at<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>all bearable. This Is the origin of that cheerfulness which is peculiar to<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>woman and" makes her fit to divert man, and in case of need, to console<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>him when he is weighed down by cares. To consult women in matter of<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>difficulty, as the Germans used to do in old times, is by no means a<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>matter to be overlooked; for their way of grasping a thing is quite<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>different from ours, chiefly because they like the shortest way to the<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>point, and usually keep their attention fixed upon what lies nearest;</ab>

This is why women<lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>are more sober In their judgment than we, and why they see nothing<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>more In things than is really there; while we, if our passions are roused,<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>slightly exaggerate or add to our imagination.<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>&amp; It is because women's reasoning powers are weaker that they show<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>more sympathy for the unfortunate than men, and consequently take a<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>kindlier Interest in them. On the other hand, women are inferior to men<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>in matters of justice, honesty, and conscientiousness. Again, because<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>their reasoning faculty Is weak, things clearly visible and real, and<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>belonging to the present, exercise a power over them which Is rarely<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>counteracted by abstract thoughts, fixed maxims, or firm resolutions, in<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>general, by regard for the past and future or by consideration for what<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>Is absent and remote. Accordingly they have the first and principal<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>qualities of virtue, but they lack the secondary qualities which are often<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>a necessary instrument in developing it. Women may be compared in<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>this respect to an organism that has a liver but no gall-bladder, (i) So<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>that it will be found that the fundamental fault in the character of<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>women is that they have no "sense of This arises from their<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>deficiency in the power of reasoning already referred to, and reflection,<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>but Is also partly due to the fact that Nature has not destined them, as<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>the weaker sex, to be dependent on strength but on cunning; this is<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>why they are instinctively crafty, and have an Ineradicable tendency to<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>lie. For as lions are furnished with claws and teeth, elephants with<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>tusksj boars with fangs, bulls with horns, and the cuttlefish with its<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>dark, inky fluid, so Nature has provided woman for her protection and<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>defence with the faculty of dissimulation, and ail the power which Nature<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>has given to man in the form of bodily strength and reason has been<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>conferred on woman in this form. Hence, dissimulation Is innate in<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>woman and almost as characteristic of the very stupid as of the clever.<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>Accordingly, it is as natural for women to dissemble at every opportunity<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>as it is for those animals to turn to their weapons when they are<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>attacked; and they feel in doing so that in a certain measure they are</ab>

Hence Rosseau said, " Les<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>femmes, en general, n'aiment aucun art, ne se connoissent a<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>et n'ont aucun genie. (Lettre k d'Alemberi, note XX). Everyone who<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>can see through jx sham must have found this to be the case.

The SaSlc law would be<lb facs="P14_TL00007"/>unnecessary; It would be a superfluous truism. The European lady,<lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>strictly speaking, is a creature who should not exist at ail; but there<lb facs="P14_TL00009"/>ought to be housekeepers, and young girls who hope to become such;<lb facs="P14_TL00010"/>and they should be brought up not to be arrogant, but to be domesticated<lb facs="P14_TL00011"/>and submissive. It is exactly because there are ladies in Europe that<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>women of a lower standing, that is to say, the larger majority of the<lb facs="P14_TL00013"/>sex, are much more unhappy than they are in the East.<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>Even Lord Byron says (" Letters and Papers," by Thomas Moore,<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>vol.

Therefore, whilst<lb facs="P15_TL00004"/>among polygamous nations every woman finds maintenance, where mo~<lb facs="P15_TL00005"/>nogamy exists the number of married women is limited, and a countless<lb facs="P15_TL00006"/>number of women who are without support remain over; those in the<lb facs="P15_TL00007"/>upper classes vegetate as useless old maids, those in the lower are<lb facs="P15_TL00008"/>reduced to very hard work of a distasteful nature, or become prostitutes,<lb facs="P15_TL00009"/>and lead a life which is as joyless as it is void of honour. But under<lb facs="P15_TL00010"/>such circumstances they become a necessity to the masculine sex; so<lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>that their position is~open!y recognised as a special means for protecting<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>from seduction those other women favoured by fate either to have found<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>husbands, or who hope to find them. In London alone there are 80,000<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>prostitutes. (1) Then what are these women who have come too quickly<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>to this most terrible end but human sacrifices on the altar of monogamy ?<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>The women here referred to and who are placed in this wretched<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>position are the inevitable counterbalance to the European lady, with<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>her pretensions and arrogance. Hence polygamy is a real benefit to the<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>female sex, taking it as a whole. And, on the other hand, there is no<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>reason why a man whose wife suffers from chronic illness, or remains<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>barren, or has gradually become too old for him, should not take a second.<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>Many people become converts to Mormonism for the precise reasons that<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>they condemn the unnatural institution of monogamy. The conferring<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>of unnatural rights upon women has imposed unnatural duties upon<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>them, the violation of which, however, makes them unhappy.<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>For example, many a man thinks marriage unadvisabie as far as his<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>social standing and monetary position are concerned, unless he contracts<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>a brilliant match, He will then wish to win a woman of his own choice<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>under different conditions, namely, under those which will render safe<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>her future and that of her children.

The<lb facs="P17_TL00005"/>love of a father for his children is of a different nature and more sincere;<lb facs="P17_TL00006"/>it is founded on a recognition of his own inner self in the child, and is<lb facs="P17_TL00007"/>therefore metaphysical In Its origin.<lb facs="P17_TL00008"/>&amp; In almost every nation, both of the new and old world, and even<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>among the Hottentots, property is inherited by the male descendants<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>alone; it Is only in Europe that one has departed from this. That the<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>property which men have with difficulty acquired by long-continued<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>struggling and hard work should afterwards come into the hands of<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>women, who, in their want of reason, either squander it within a short<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>time or otherwise waste it, is an injustice as great as it is common, and<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>it should be prevented by limiting the right of women to inherit. It<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>seems to me that it would be a better arrangement if women, be they<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>widows or daughters, only inherited the money for life secured by<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>mortgage, but not the property itself or the capital, unless there lacked<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>*<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>male descendants. It is men who make the money, and not women;<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>therefore women are neither justified in having unconditional possession<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>of it nor capable of administrating it. Women should never have the<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>free disposition of wealth, strictly so-called, which they may inherit, such<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>as capital, houses, and estates. They need a guardian always; therefore<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>they should not have the guardianship of their children under any<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>circumstances whatever. The vanity of women, even if it should not be<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>greater than that of men, has this evil In it, that it is directed on<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>material things... that is to say, on their personal beauty and then on<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>tinsel, pomp, and show. This is why they are in their right element in<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>society. This It is which makes them inclined to be extravagant,<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>especially since they posses little reasoning power. Accordingly, an ancient<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>writer says, TUVVI TO CUVOXOV icridz—z-rs,pcv (*) Men's vanity, on the<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>other hand, Is often directed on non-material advantages, such as intellect,<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>learning, courage, and the like.

"Datelin, player of instruments," and nothing more.<lb facs="P38_TL00024"/>&amp; It became necessary, then, for Jal to find some convenient explanation<lb facs="P38_TL00025"/>of his equivocal assertion, in order to make the confusion, of which he<lb facs="P38_TL00026"/>accused his predecessors, appear to be possible.

The French Polichinelle, who Is a personage entirely<lb facs="P38_TL00028"/>" different from the Italian Pulcinella, appeared on the scene In the<lb facs="P38_TL00029"/>" time of Henry iv and of the Spanish war.

As to the confusion of the Datelins with the Brioches,<lb facs="P39_TL00010"/>which Jal imagines, it is contradicted by the agreement of all writers,<lb facs="P39_TL00011"/>and by the uniformity of all documentary evidence.<lb facs="P39_TL00012"/>We have seen that in the register of expenses of the Royal family for the<lb facs="P39_TL00013"/>year I669, there was an entry of 1365 lire as having been paid to Brioche for<lb facs="P39_TL00014"/>the months of September, October and November at the Castle of S. Germain<lb facs="P39_TL00015"/>en Layes. On page forty seven of the same register, and for the same year,<lb facs="P39_TL00016"/>we read :... 44 To Francesco Datelin, a player of marionettes, in payment of<lb facs="P39_TL00017"/>44 fifty-six days, during which he lived at Saint-Germain en Laye for the<lb facs="P39_TL00018"/>44 purpose of amusing Monseigneur le Dauphin, at the rate of 20 lire per<lb facs="P39_TL00019"/>44 day, from the 17th. July till the Isth. of August 1669 ; and of fifteen<lb facs="P39_TL00020"/>44 lire per day for the last days of the said month,... 320 lire. "<lb facs="P39_TL00021"/>Datelin, therefore, was not Brioche. Brioche and Datelin were two<lb facs="P39_TL00022"/>showmen, the one Italian and the other French, who in the same year,<lb facs="P39_TL00023"/>and on two different occasions, succeeded one another on the stage of<lb facs="P39_TL00024"/>the Royal theatre to divert the son of France. They may have been<lb facs="P39_TL00025"/>associated in the conduct together of marionette plays with a view to<lb facs="P39_TL00026"/>render them richer and more varied as regarded repertory that was to<lb facs="P39_TL00027"/>last for five consecutive months.<lb facs="P39_TL00028"/>The fame of Briocci increased so rapidly and became so preponderant,<lb facs="P39_TL00029"/>that his name, distorted 44 alia francese " served as an ensign, and as a<lb facs="P39_TL00030"/>title of nobility for his more obscure colleague. Thus is explained the<lb facs="P39_TL00031"/>error of the father baptist, who, on the occasion quoted by Jal, attributed<lb facs="P39_TL00032"/>the surname of Briocher to old Datelin, who, as long as he lived, poor,<lb facs="P39_TL00033"/>man, never dreamt of usurping it.</ab>

Yet the thoroughness with which he<lb facs="P46_TL00025"/>set to work has an interest for us. His inventions were bad, but it is of<lb facs="P46_TL00026"/>interest to know when and by what means we became possessed of these<lb facs="P46_TL00027"/>absurdities which have so long hindered the development of Drama.<lb facs="P46_TL00028"/>&amp; These scenes, very popular In the seventeenth century, were often<lb facs="P46_TL00029"/>magnificient in size and decoration, having regular wings, back cloths<lb facs="P46_TL00030"/>and stage, at the ribalta of which stood the high altar of the church.<lb facs="P46_TL00031"/>They were called " teatri " or theatres, and some survival of them may<lb facs="P46_TL00032"/>even yet be traced in the " sepulchres " which are arranged, often with<lb facs="P46_TL00033"/>life-size figures, in the Italian churches during Holy Week.<lb facs="P46_TL00034"/>But it is when we come to his work for the secular theatre that we<lb facs="P46_TL00035"/>find Padre Pozzo most interesting, and it is In his plans and designs<lb facs="P46_TL00036"/>that we trace for the first time many of the features which have, alas,<lb facs="P46_TL00037"/>become habitual in the theatres of today.</ab>

It was then<lb facs="P63_TL00018"/>that the Court ladies and City dames flocked to the depots to buy them,<lb facs="P63_TL00019"/>having first been provided with money by their husbands. When pins<lb facs="P63_TL00020"/>became cheap and common, the ladies spent their allowances on other<lb facs="P63_TL00021"/>fancies; but the term pin-money remained in vogue." (Dictionary of<lb facs="P63_TL00022"/>Phrase and Fable).<lb facs="P63_TL00023"/>£? A similar practise was carried out in France.

It appears also from this author that pin-money formed at one<lb facs="P63_TL00030"/>time a constituent part of bargains; for he continues, "hence the<lb facs="P63_TL00031"/>custom of still giving the name pins, or pin-money, to certain presents<lb facs="P63_TL00032"/>which accompany the most considerable bargains, in which it is usual<lb facs="P63_TL00033"/>to give something towards the wife or children of the person with whom<lb facs="P63_TL00034"/>the bargain is struck. " (Cyclopaedia, 1741.)<lb facs="P63_TL00035"/>Judging from the readiness with which nearly every fact connected<lb facs="P63_TL00036"/>with the early Import of pins is disputed, the little article is one exciting<lb facs="P63_TL00037"/>considerable interest.</ab>

But also, he responded<lb facs="P76_TL00006"/>44 to the need of elegance and of splendour which exists in primitive<lb facs="P76_TL00007"/>44 souls, and never was there duke or prince who knew so well as he<lb facs="P76_TL00008"/>44 how to kiss the hand of a woman and to touch a woman. But when<lb facs="P76_TL00009"/>44 he had devoutly bowed before the Fairy who uttered her strophes,<lb facs="P76_TL00010"/>44 victorious, carried away and agitating ruby wings, he dared to sketch,<lb facs="P76_TL00011"/>44 to lightly Indicate, the gesture of taking with her some liberty, and<lb facs="P76_TL00012"/>44 the Fairy was not at all annoyed by it, nor the public, to such an<lb facs="P76_TL00013"/>44 extent was he the spoiled child of all.<lb facs="P76_TL00014"/>44 Sans peser, sans rester " might have been perfectly the motto of<lb facs="P76_TL00015"/>44 his talent.

"<lb facs="P76_TL00026"/>Champfleury adds his testimony, declaring that, although he was<lb facs="P76_TL00027"/>usually opposed to the dominance of one great actor in a company, 44 to<lb facs="P76_TL00028"/>44 Debureau pere one could pardon everything; he was more than a great<lb facs="P76_TL00029"/>44 comedian, he was a creator.

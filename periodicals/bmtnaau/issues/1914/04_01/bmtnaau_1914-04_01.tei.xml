The<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>handle is then bent according to the form of the Wayang figure and tied<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>to the figure with the dried fibres of the cocoa=nut shell, these fibres<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>being preferred because the binding does not move and holds well.</ab>

In fact nothing that was improbable<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>could possibly surprise Count Carlo, for the stuff that dreams are made<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>of was his normal mental fare, and his whole time was passed in a<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>world where everything was possible, and in close communion with such<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>unusual personalities as Singing Apples, Talking Statues and Stag Kings.<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>&amp; The matter-of-fact repelled him; realities annoyed him.

A few years<lb facs="P30_TL00023"/>afterwards, in the days of sorrow, and especially during the occupation<lb facs="P30_TL00024"/>of Frankfort by the French army, Goethe made his little theatre the<lb facs="P30_TL00025"/>pastime and amusement of his family and neighbours. He managed all<lb facs="P30_TL00026"/>his little wooden 44 personaggi " himself, presented some of the most<lb facs="P30_TL00027"/>popular plays of the time and also some of the most highly praised dramas<lb facs="P30_TL00028"/>of classic literature, introducing jiew characters as additions to the<lb facs="P30_TL00029"/>original scheme, and improvising dialogues, episodes and farces adapted<lb facs="P30_TL00030"/>for his little puppets.<lb facs="P30_TL00031"/>Even when he had reached the age of twenty, and was preoccupied<lb facs="P30_TL00032"/>with the creation of his 44 Goetz von Berlichingen, " he did not forget<lb facs="P30_TL00033"/>his puppets but, putting aside his mania for improvisation, he wrote a<lb facs="P30_TL00034"/>comedy for a small marionette theatre, called 44 Festivals of the fair of<lb facs="P30_TL00035"/>Plundersweilern " in the course of which he criticised his own audience,<lb facs="P30_TL00036"/>and exposed their defects and prejudices.<lb facs="P30_TL00037"/>That youthful little 44 bagattella " has a particularity that is worthy</ab>

"<lb facs="P31_TL00014"/>The Court of Weimar was not the only one in Germany that sought<lb facs="P31_TL00015"/>distraction in a puppet theatre.

He looks upon the eye las a great instrument for absorbing<lb facs="P44_TL00014"/>dramatic emotion... since true vision does not end with the retina, but<lb facs="P44_TL00015"/>sinks deep into one's inner consciousness. The eye is not less than the<lb facs="P44_TL00016"/>ear. The marriage of sight and hearing is the perfect union necessary for<lb facs="P44_TL00017"/>receiving complete dramatic impression.<lb facs="P44_TL00018"/>Many people, having looked with admiration upon Mr Craig's designs,<lb facs="P44_TL00019"/>have gone away under the misapprehension that he wished to introduce<lb facs="P44_TL00020"/>oaintino-s into the theatre. It is unfortunate that a man's own work<lb facs="P44_TL00021"/>should thus recoil upon him, and confuse minds as to his intentions,<lb facs="P44_TL00022"/>essentially so different. The absence of a permanent theatre, where he<lb facs="P44_TL00023"/>might experiment and give concrete form to new ideas, has impelled him<lb facs="P44_TL00024"/>hitherto to seek another outlet for their expression, despite the limitation<lb facs="P44_TL00025"/>of that outlet or medium. Had he had such a place earlier, it is probable<lb facs="P44_TL00026"/>these designs would never have been seen by the public. They might<lb facs="P44_TL00027"/>have taken the form of actual productions.<lb facs="P44_TL00028"/>VTow that Mr Craig's school at Florence is an assured fact, we can look<lb facs="P44_TL00029"/>forward to some practical realisation of the theories he has advanced<lb facs="P44_TL00030"/>so persistently.

It will be seen<lb facs="P45_TL00016"/>from these that his methods are not only ingenious, but are even more<lb facs="P45_TL00017"/>Interesting for the sane suggestion they contain for the foundation of<lb facs="P45_TL00018"/>the New Theatre. It was even then apparent from the voluminous f01i0...<lb facs="P45_TL00019"/>full of facts, plans, and figures... which he brought to his assistance, that he<lb facs="P45_TL00020"/>had left nothing outside his calculation. And one cannot fail to note how<lb facs="P45_TL00021"/>curiously his mind works, how strangely the practical in him blends with<lb facs="P45_TL00022"/>the ideal, how significantly he animates all material things with symbols.<lb facs="P45_TL00023"/>'jrhe school will study the Past and Present and the speculative Future.<lb facs="P45_TL00024"/>Study of the Past will involve the Oxford and Cambridge methods.<lb facs="P45_TL00025"/>This will be dry evening work.<lb facs="P45_TL00026"/>Study of the Present will be thoroughly practical, productive.

Dawn is the exciting time,<lb facs="P45_TL00030"/>full of symbolic significance.

These will be often illustrated by the kinematograph and other<lb facs="P46_TL00005"/>practical means.<lb facs="P46_TL00006"/>One of the most important studies will be that of movement in nature.,,<lb facs="P46_TL00007"/>the movements of trees, wind, water, the flight of birds, the glide of<lb facs="P46_TL00008"/>fish, snakes, the movement of the human figure.<lb facs="P46_TL00009"/>Comparisons will be made, with the object of discovering any vital<lb facs="P46_TL00010"/>resemblance between the various movements and of establishing a<lb facs="P46_TL00011"/>universal principle.

An effort will be made to find what is at<lb facs="P46_TL00017"/>the root of all movements, and what are the primary forms of movement.<lb facs="P46_TL00018"/>All these movements from nature wili be taken to the table, dissected,<lb facs="P46_TL00019"/>tested thoroughly. Nature's secrets will be wrested from her. Only in<lb facs="P46_TL00020"/>this way is it possible to get at the structure and internals of art. The<lb facs="P46_TL00021"/>externals of art are so attractive that it is easy to be deceived as to<lb facs="P46_TL00022"/>their actual value.<lb facs="P46_TL00023"/>An attempt will be made to find a new road. The important thing is<lb facs="P46_TL00024"/>not to be a pupil of Rembrandt or Hokusai, but of the thing which gave<lb facs="P46_TL00025"/>birth to both men, a pupil of the thing they groped for. One must go<lb facs="P46_TL00026"/>direct to nature. The danger is in departing from nature. Artists are fine<lb facs="P46_TL00027"/>where they resemble each other. The finest of Rembrandt's etched lines,<lb facs="P46_TL00028"/>without ornamentation, will resemble a line by Hokusai. Two straight,<lb facs="P46_TL00029"/>structural lines forming the sail of a mill, as drawn by Rembrandt, will<lb facs="P46_TL00030"/>in no wise differ, when least adorned, from those drawn by an Indian or<lb facs="P46_TL00031"/>by a Japanese. These two fine, sharp lines are chronicles of fact. They<lb facs="P46_TL00032"/>give the form. And form is valuable because it is an abiding thing, while<lb facs="P46_TL00033"/>light and colour are fleeting. Form keeps a -thing clear and orderly.<lb facs="P46_TL00034"/>Therefore, the geometry of nature which creates form will be studied.<lb facs="P46_TL00035"/>Without form there can be no life. All else is artifice. Ballet-dancing...<lb facs="P46_TL00036"/>the best of it... is artifice. The goosestep of a German soldier is<lb facs="P46_TL00037"/>artificial; the ordinary walking of troops is natural and magnificent.</ab>

Mr<lb facs="P48_TL00011"/>Gordon Craig does not believe that the Theatre of the Future can be<lb facs="P48_TL00012"/>produced by the magician's wand, suddenly, out of a hat. fie regards it,<lb facs="P48_TL00013"/>as he regards all art, as a product of slow growth ; and the artist's<lb facs="P48_TL00014"/>methods as resembling those of Nature itself. If the theatre is to be<lb facs="P48_TL00015"/>established as a strong and permanent institution, it must begin from<lb facs="P48_TL00016"/>the very beginning and rise to eminence only by slow and progressive<lb facs="P48_TL00017"/>methods. He logically looks upon his school as that essentiai beginning, as<lb facs="P48_TL00018"/>yet hardly larger than a healthy germ, but equally susceptible of healthy<lb facs="P48_TL00019"/>and important development.<lb facs="P48_TL00020"/>None more than Mr Craig realises that it Is not for one man, nor yet<lb facs="P48_TL00021"/>for several men, to carry on the work of the theatre's restoration. He<lb facs="P48_TL00022"/>believes, however, that he has rediscovered an old truth, an eternal truth,<lb facs="P48_TL00023"/>and that any deviation from this truth is bound to be as disastrous for<lb facs="P48_TL00024"/>life as for art. For him the Theatre of the Future has its roots, not in<lb facs="P48_TL00025"/>the present, but in the deep past; this only as far as it affects the soul<lb facs="P48_TL00026"/>of the art; externally, it will, of necessity, belong to Modernity.</ab>

But<lb facs="P63_TL00026"/>it must be remembered that although the figure has been gradually<lb facs="P63_TL00027"/>estranged from architecture during the last four centuries and historical<lb facs="P63_TL00028"/>portraiture has been suffered to become altogether a thing of the past<lb facs="P63_TL00029"/>there is at the present time a very strong disposition on the part of<lb facs="P63_TL00030"/>some architects to employ sculpture in its old and only legitimate func<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Nor need we hesitate to predict<lb facs="P64_TL00005"/>that it will not be long before this revived delight in God's noblest and<lb facs="P64_TL00006"/>final work of creation will make itself felt more generally; when mere<lb facs="P64_TL00007"/>*- * 1<lb facs="P64_TL00008"/>millinery will give place to art in textile fabrics; when in our churches<lb facs="P64_TL00009"/>at least upon altar cloth and vestment and hanging the human form as<lb facs="P64_TL00010"/>saint or angel will be " wrought about with gold and divers colours. "<lb facs="P64_TL00011"/>Now in art, if we omit altogether the barbarism of academic blankets,<lb facs="P64_TL00012"/>there are only two systems of dress. The one historical, the other<lb facs="P64_TL00013"/>conventional. The one by clothing the person represented in the habit as<lb facs="P64_TL00014"/>he lived when he belongs to a past age involves the study of archeology;<lb facs="P64_TL00015"/>the other by clothing him in the fashion of the artist's own time (which<lb facs="P64_TL00016"/>last may also become historical when the person represented is contem°&gt;<lb facs="P64_TL00017"/>porary with the artist) involves the study of the fashion of the day.<lb facs="P64_TL00018"/>£? The last system was almost invariably adopted in past times under<lb facs="P64_TL00019"/>all conditions.<lb facs="P64_TL00020"/>it is manifest that the more perfect course, (that indeed which we<lb facs="P64_TL00021"/>should take) Is to adopt both systems, the first for the representation<lb facs="P64_TL00022"/>of the past, the second for the portrayal of the present. Prom the science<lb facs="P64_TL00023"/>of archeology diligently followed we may certainly learn one system.<lb facs="P64_TL00024"/>The question is, are the fashions of today capable of being raised to any,<lb facs="P64_TL00025"/>even the lowest level in the temple of Art ?<lb facs="P64_TL00026"/>&amp; I think they are. Let us consider how.<lb facs="P64_TL00027"/>lt has been said, and 1 see no reason whatever to question the assertion,<lb facs="P64_TL00028"/>that all art is the expression of man's delight in God's works. We may<lb facs="P64_TL00029"/>take it for granted that no one wishes to dress u/iartistically. Even if<lb facs="P64_TL00030"/>gentlemen be indifferent it would be heresy to suppose for one moment<lb facs="P64_TL00031"/>that the time and money which ladies spend upon dress were purposely<lb facs="P64_TL00032"/>devoted to the production of the unnatural unartistlc and therefore ugly<lb facs="P64_TL00033"/>results which we so often see. The evil rests not with ladies and<lb facs="P64_TL00034"/>gentlemen except in so far that passiveness and indifference are evils, but<lb facs="P64_TL00035"/>is rather to be found in the restless brains of milliner and tailor. To fight<lb facs="P64_TL00036"/>against these is no slight work and rather than engage in it people<lb facs="P64_TL00037"/>submit their necks to the yoke. Much good however might be done if<lb facs="P64_TL00038"/>there was more home»made work. For we can scarcely imagine that</ab>

There are some people who will be always<lb facs="P67_TL00009"/>talking, to whom the myriad glories of nature and the highest excellencies<lb facs="P67_TL00010"/>of art are all equally 44 charming, " or 44 pretty " or 44 beautiful " or<lb facs="P67_TL00011"/>nice. These are the people who wear things not because of any beauty<lb facs="P67_TL00012"/>in the articles but because they are 44 worn Just now " and because they<lb facs="P67_TL00013"/>are the last things out. There are happily others to whom nature and<lb facs="P67_TL00014"/>art are something more than pretty or nice, people who can take in the<lb facs="P67_TL00015"/>Beautiful and the message which it bears them quietly and peacefully<lb facs="P67_TL00016"/>with just perhaps a little more electricity as the spirit yearns to thank 9<lb facs="P67_TL00017"/>fulness and praise.

"<lb facs="P67_TL00020"/>Between these two extremes the many may be classed, and it is with<lb facs="P67_TL00021"/>the many we have to do, for the lowest will follow the many although<lb facs="P67_TL00022"/>always in the rear and the highest may generally be left to themselves.<lb facs="P67_TL00023"/>There is perhaps one imperfection from which even the highest are<lb facs="P67_TL00024"/>not exempt, and it may be that their very gentleness is one reason why<lb facs="P67_TL00025"/>the imperfection clings to them. If the English nation were not so rude,<lb facs="P67_TL00026"/>I<lb facs="P67_TL00027"/>If our men and boys could allow people whose dress was slightly different<lb facs="P67_TL00028"/>from others to pass unmolested, if all our schools, national and others,<lb facs="P67_TL00029"/>gave the sense of vision the instruction it ought to receive, the obtruding<lb facs="P67_TL00030"/>ugliness of crinoline would long since have quite disappeared : but the<lb facs="P67_TL00031"/>low observations of street boys and the rude stares of many both in the<lb facs="P67_TL00032"/>lower and the middle classes which the absense of popular uglinesses<lb facs="P67_TL00033"/>evokes require to be met with more courage than Is perhaps consistent<lb facs="P67_TL00034"/>with that tenderness which is such a special attribute of gentle life#<lb facs="P67_TL00035"/>Nevertheless we all doubtless know those who have passed tills ordeal<lb facs="P67_TL00036"/>but not without at first some self-denial and some little pain# Be this<lb facs="P67_TL00037"/>as it may there is no reason why popular and particular forms of ugliness<lb facs="P67_TL00038"/>should not be dispensed with in the house.</ab>

One thing however worth<lb facs="P68_TL00013"/>noticing Is that both in classic and mediaeval fashions the shape of the<lb facs="P68_TL00014"/>arm was almost always maintained either by being left bare or, as in<lb facs="P68_TL00015"/>the middle ages, by tightly-fitting sleeves at least from the wrist to<lb facs="P68_TL00016"/>the elbow.<lb facs="P68_TL00017"/>An examination of the manuscripts, monuments, marbles and ivoiies<lb facs="P68_TL00018"/>in the British Museum alone will be sufficient to convince us of the<lb facs="P68_TL00019"/>great Importance of this fashion and will enable us to account for its<lb facs="P68_TL00020"/>long continuance; for there can be no question that much of the life,<lb facs="P68_TL00021"/>action, yiguor and grace of the figure work of the past depends on the<lb facs="P68_TL00022"/>limbs we are considering being unencumbered.<lb facs="P68_TL00023"/>From the few rough diagrams before you (1) taken from examples of the<lb facs="P68_TL00024"/>most popular dresses of the best periods of mediaeval art you may observe<lb facs="P68_TL00025"/>that the complete visible outdoor dress of both men and women principally<lb facs="P68_TL00026"/>consisted of three garments: the undermost was the gown, robe or funic;<lb facs="P68_TL00027"/>over that was the dalmatic, surcoat, cyclas or super-tunic, and then come<lb facs="P68_TL00028"/>the mantle.

But as she left the<lb facs="P70_TL00028"/>44 church and lifted up her train on account of the dirt a certain holy<lb facs="P70_TL00029"/>" man saw a devil laughing and having adjured him to tell why he<lb facs="P70_TL00030"/>44 laughed the devil said, 'a companion of mine was just now sitting on<lb facs="P70_TL00031"/>44 the train of that woman using it as if it were his chariot but when<lb facs="P70_TL00032"/>44 she lifted her train up my companion was shaken off into the dirt and<lb facs="P70_TL00033"/>" that is why I was laughing ". Again, the ladies are advised if their<lb facs="P70_TL00034"/>legs be not handsome, nor their feet small and delicate, to wear long<lb facs="P70_TL00035"/>robes trailing on the ground to hide them. Another writer compares the<lb facs="P70_TL00036"/>ladies to peacocks and magpies because they delight In strange habits<lb facs="P70_TL00037"/>and have long tails that trail in the dirt.</ab>

In the Imperial Library<lb facs="P71_TL00006"/>at Paris a satiricai song, written in the beginning of the 14th century,<lb facs="P71_TL00007"/>after telling us that the Bishop of Paris is a theologian and a philosopher,<lb facs="P71_TL00008"/>makes this great authority observe that a woman is too foolish a hussey<lb facs="P71_TL00009"/>who puts a false hair on her head and paints herself to please the world,<lb facs="P71_TL00010"/>A woman is not free from sin, says the bishop, who has her hair dark<lb facs="P71_TL00011"/>or blonde according to nature when she places her intention and care<lb facs="P71_TL00012"/>in fixing the false hair along on her tresses. Another critic, attacking<lb facs="P71_TL00013"/>the frisettes of his day, says that between the towel or gorget and the<lb facs="P71_TL00014"/>temple and the horns there is a space through which a rat might pass<lb facs="P71_TL00015"/>or the largest weasel between this and Arras.<lb facs="P71_TL00016"/>£? With the approach of the 14th century was recuscitated also the<lb facs="P71_TL00017"/>\<lb facs="P71_TL00018"/>custom of tight lacing. At first it was little more than a close fitting<lb facs="P71_TL00019"/>neatly-laced body such indeed as we see in the best effigies and illutni*<lb facs="P71_TL00020"/>nations. But the almost Qreek simplicity, purity and grace of the 13th<lb facs="P71_TL00021"/>century gradually disappeared in the 14th until it was ultimately lost in<lb facs="P71_TL00022"/>the full tide of the restless luxurlousness of the 15th century, and it was<lb facs="P71_TL00023"/>not until then that tight-lacing in the sense we unfortunately know it<lb facs="P71_TL00024"/>became a general fashion.<lb facs="P71_TL00025"/>jz?

                                    <lb facs="P71_TL00029"/>cript of the 13th century you may remember that besides Lace tags and<lb facs="P71_TL00030"/>Laces for surcoats with knots there was another kind described as<lb facs="P71_TL00031"/>Laces for lacing sleeves. If we accept the authority of this manuscript,<lb facs="P71_TL00032"/>(and there is no reason why we should not), there can be no doubt that<lb facs="P71_TL00033"/>the' Lace fastening whether for body, foot or arm was that which was<lb facs="P71_TL00034"/>generally adopted by well-dressed people during the reign of the third<lb facs="P71_TL00035"/>Henry. That such laces are not apparent either in the drawings or<lb facs="P71_TL00036"/>sculpture of the 13th century is no argument against their use because<lb facs="P71_TL00037"/>it must be remembered that, like the fringes to which 1 have referred and<lb facs="P71_TL00038"/>the use of which Matthew of Paris places beyond question, they were by<lb facs="P71_TL00039"/>no means easy to represent unless the artist sacrificed some of that</ab>

As the button fashion became established these little excrescences<lb facs="P72_TL00016"/>extended further and further until they even reached the shoulder, and<lb facs="P72_TL00017"/>with this excess tight fitting was also carried to excess and applied to<lb facs="P72_TL00018"/>the entire sleeve of the tunic.<lb facs="P72_TL00019"/>It may be worth while pausing here for a moment to note how easily<lb facs="P72_TL00020"/>a new fashion irreproachable in itself may drift into the preposterous.<lb facs="P72_TL00021"/>jg? The button fastening which took the place of the lace fastenings in<lb facs="P72_TL00022"/>the last quarter of the 13th century are possibly preferable to the<lb facs="P72_TL00023"/>latter on practical grounds as offering not only less hindrance in dressing<lb facs="P72_TL00024"/>but more opportunity for obtaining a greater variety of useful ornament.<lb facs="P72_TL00025"/>In all the early and good examples it will be found however that In no<lb facs="P72_TL00026"/>station of life were they employed in any other way than as fastenings,<lb facs="P72_TL00027"/>rarely reaching and never going beyond the elbow in the sleeve and in<lb facs="P72_TL00028"/>the body rarely reaching and never going beyond the waist.

But a common<lb facs="P73_TL00014"/>#<lb facs="P73_TL00015"/>form of the supertunic was the sleeveless dalmatica which after the<lb facs="P73_TL00016"/>reign of Henry 111 was so cut as to become not only sleeveless but sideless<lb facs="P73_TL00017"/>from the shoulder to the waist.<lb facs="P73_TL00018"/>ln the exquisite drawings of Queen Mary's Psalter, the manuscript<lb facs="P73_TL00019"/>marked 2.

From this and other sources we learn<lb facs="P73_TL00021"/>that the skirt was sometimes open in front and sometimes at the back<lb facs="P73_TL00022"/>and sometimes on both sides as high as the hip, that there was a great<lb facs="P73_TL00023"/>variety of sleeves and that it was only ladies cf high rank who appear<lb facs="P73_TL00024"/>to have worn the sleeveless surcoat or the pendant sleeve.<lb facs="P73_TL00025"/>jg? The neck of the super-tunic was generally cut like that of the tunic,<lb facs="P73_TL00026"/>open in front and laced or buttoned, the hood being sometimes attached<lb facs="P73_TL00027"/>to it and sometimes worn as a distinct article of dress with a small cape.<lb facs="P73_TL00028"/>But with the reign of the second Edward and the fopperies and fooleries<lb facs="P73_TL00029"/>which were encouraged by the favourites of the Court the cut of the<lb facs="P73_TL00030"/>neck piece grew lower and lower.<lb facs="P73_TL00031"/>g?

The collar or neck-piece of the mantle in its simplest<lb facs="P73_TL00035"/>form was concentric with the neckt as the tunic and supertunic fell more<lb facs="P73_TL00036"/>upon the shoulders so too the outer garment was gradually allowed to<lb facs="P73_TL00037"/>fall lower.<lb facs="P73_TL00038"/>jg?

The queen of<lb facs="P74_TL00021"/>Henry II wore a robe bespangled with crescents of gold and Richard I's<lb facs="P74_TL00022"/>mantle was over-spread with half moons and shining orbs of solid<lb facs="P74_TL00023"/>silver; but with the reign of the third Henry came a reign of greater<lb facs="P74_TL00024"/>simplicity. Thus ornament retired from the general surface of the garment<lb facs="P74_TL00025"/>to Its border, and, instead of concelling the fabric with a redundancy which<lb facs="P74_TL00026"/>was formless and without any order and method, adorned it within the<lb facs="P74_TL00027"/>compass of narrow bands of great beauty and really good workmanship<lb facs="P74_TL00028"/>around ail its margins.<lb facs="P74_TL00029"/>&amp; At the neck of the supertunfc or dalmatica worn by great officials<lb facs="P74_TL00030"/>was a stiff bordering of considerable beauty often enriched with valuable<lb facs="P74_TL00031"/>jewels. This was the type of the modern collar. The margins of the sleeves<lb facs="P74_TL00032"/>of both tunic and supertunic were encircled by similar bands which laid<lb facs="P74_TL00033"/>the foundation for a modern cuff and wristband. The lower margins or<lb facs="P74_TL00034"/>skirt-hems of these garments as well as the edge of the mantle were<lb facs="P74_TL00035"/>similarly enriched. It is important to notice that in this method of<lb facs="P74_TL00036"/>ornamenting the costume the lines or bands of decoration were horizontal,<lb facs="P74_TL00037"/>thus opposing, and therefore heightening, the effect and beauty of the<lb facs="P74_TL00038"/>natural form. *</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P77_TL00003"/>Early in the 14th century this principle of decoration received an<lb facs="P77_TL00004"/>increased development. The horizontal bands formed by the enriched<lb facs="P77_TL00005"/>margins of the tunic, the supertunic and the mantle were found so<lb facs="P77_TL00006"/>valuable in an art point of view that they were produced in the fabric<lb facs="P77_TL00007"/>itself, sometimes in excess, as is particularly observable on some of the<lb facs="P77_TL00008"/>figures which illustrate a missal of this period, No. 17006 In the British<lb facs="P77_TL00009"/>Museum.<lb facs="P77_TL00010"/>&amp; The proper use of these bands Is, however, well shown in the illu<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

In the simplest work where it is only the placing of<lb facs="P77_TL00030"/>one colour upon another nothing more is required than an edging of<lb facs="P77_TL00031"/>cord to the pattern or figure, covering the line of-stitching and secured<lb facs="P77_TL00032"/>to it by being worked over with coloured silk or thread. But where the<lb facs="P77_TL00033"/>design involves more than two colours the colours are not cut out as<lb facs="P77_TL00034"/>they appear in the design but are superimposed : for example in the cross<lb facs="P77_TL00035"/>on the specimen here exhibited the blue is not cut out in small pieces and<lb facs="P77_TL00036"/>joined to the white on the same plane as in modern patch- work but is<lb facs="P77_TL00037"/>shaped to the full size of the cross and actually underlines the white.</ab>

This also was worked upon a foundation<lb facs="P78_TL00015"/>of canvass, veilum or linen and sometimes silk and then sewn upon<lb facs="P78_TL00016"/>the dress.<lb facs="P78_TL00017"/>Third in order of richness is what I may call the cord work; where<lb facs="P78_TL00018"/>the border, or ribaning as Chaucer calls it, is of uniform colour and the<lb facs="P78_TL00019"/>pattern entirely formed by raised lines of cord or common twine. This<lb facs="P78_TL00020"/>was a process very commonly employed with cloth of gold and gold lace,<lb facs="P78_TL00021"/>the cord being sewn or whipped over and completely covered with gold<lb facs="P78_TL00022"/>thread. The effigy of Richard I supplies us with four examples of this<lb facs="P78_TL00023"/>class of border work.<lb facs="P78_TL00024"/>But this kind, like the last mentioned, was not infrequently used In<lb facs="P78_TL00025"/>combination with jewels as illustrated by the effigies and illuminations<lb facs="P78_TL00026"/>of the 13th and latter part of the 12th centuries. Nor must it be imagined<lb facs="P78_TL00027"/>that these enrichments were confined to the official robes of king or<lb facs="P78_TL00028"/>priest. There were of course distinctions of dress according with the<lb facs="P78_TL00029"/>social rank of the wearer; the labourer had to be content with a short<lb facs="P78_TL00030"/>tunic, the burgess might have In addition a supertunic and like Dogberry<lb facs="P78_TL00031"/>bring forward the fact of his having two gowns to his back as evidence<lb facs="P78_TL00032"/>of his respectability, but all above this'class might be possessed of tunle,<lb facs="P78_TL00033"/>supertunic and mantle, the material, wool, silk or velvet, and the quality<lb facs="P78_TL00034"/>of border being the distinguishing marks.<lb facs="P78_TL00035"/>Nor must it be forgotten that between the male and female costume<lb facs="P78_TL00036"/>as well as between the civil and ecclesiastical there was not that difference<lb facs="P78_TL00037"/>which is popularly supposed to have existed.

Indeed, very many of the best borders of the middle ages may<lb facs="P82_TL00009"/>be easily reproduced by sewing down cord in the manner shewn in the<lb facs="P82_TL00010"/>specimen of appllqu6 work before you, whilst the difficulty of treating<lb facs="P82_TL00011"/>braid In other than straight and continuous lines is manifested whenever<lb facs="P82_TL00012"/>anything else Is attempted.<lb facs="P82_TL00013"/>jtf Nor is there any difficulty in securing artistic trimmings if ladies are<lb facs="P82_TL00014"/>so minded. I have seen some most exquisite little borders at Heilbronner's<lb facs="P82_TL00015"/>in Regent street. But the most glorious border the world ever saw would<lb facs="P82_TL00016"/>have no chance so long as there exists that passionate longing for mere<lb facs="P82_TL00017"/>novelty which is one of the great curses of modern society in each and<lb facs="P82_TL00018"/>all its phases.<lb facs="P82_TL00019"/>£? As regards our evening dress perhaps the least said the better. It is<lb facs="P82_TL00020"/>true the revival of the turn-down collar, by shewing the neck, was one<lb facs="P82_TL00021"/>step towards that right development of the human form which is<lb facs="P82_TL00022"/>characteristic of all good costume. The Prince of Wales, (i) too, may be<lb facs="P82_TL00023"/>thanked for the revival of white waistcoats, for any relief to the dreary<lb facs="P82_TL00024"/>conventionalism of black cloth may be fairly regarded as a blessing;<lb facs="P82_TL00025"/>these are unfortunately the only exceptions to the corrupt taste which<lb facs="P82_TL00026"/>prescribes the usual evening dress of a gentleman of the present period.<lb facs="P82_TL00027"/>&amp; Of a lady's dress I will not trust myself to speak, its indecency of cut<lb facs="P82_TL00028"/>being, as a rule, unequalled even by its ugliness of trimming.<lb facs="P82_TL00029"/>&amp; Time will not permit me to enter upon the subject of our official<lb facs="P82_TL00030"/>costume which, from the royal crown to the policeman's helmet, is utterly<lb facs="P82_TL00031"/>debased 5 nor can I now trespass any further on your patience to set<lb facs="P82_TL00032"/>forth the present promising aspect of children's dress or the uncompro<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

It tells us among many other things how<lb facs="P83_TL00020"/>the decoration of dress was once as much an art as the decoration of a<lb facs="P83_TL00021"/>temple.

It tells us how both<lb facs="P83_TL00023"/>ladles' and gentlemen's dresses were once under the direction of artists<lb facs="P83_TL00024"/>many of whose names are recorded ; as, for example, Adam de Baslnges,<lb facs="P83_TL00025"/>Adam de Bakering, John de Colonia, Thomas Chenier, John Blaton,<lb facs="P83_TL00026"/>William Courtenay and Stephen Vyne, under whose superintendence<lb facs="P83_TL00027"/>women worked sometimes for their amusement and sometimes for their<lb facs="P83_TL00028"/>profit, it helps us to a better appreciation of the wonderful picturings<lb facs="P83_TL00029"/>of such poets as Chaucer and Dante, and illustrates every page of our<lb facs="P83_TL00030"/>early literature.<lb facs="P83_TL00031"/>jhe other question, viz., are the fashions of today capable of being<lb facs="P83_TL00032"/>raised to the dignity of art? is one which 1 have already answered in<lb facs="P83_TL00033"/>the affirmative; for in spite of the many gross absurdities which mark<lb facs="P83_TL00034"/>the conventionalities of our present costume, in spite of swallow-tails<lb facs="P83_TL00035"/>and chimney pots, of bastard embroidery and big buttons, I am satisfied<lb facs="P83_TL00036"/>we possess sufficient elements of beauty and appropriateness from which<lb facs="P83_TL00037"/>a costume might be developed equal to any of past times; and were</ab>

But now 1 have come south to,<lb facs="P91_TL00007"/>see what a warmer theatre can yield.<lb facs="P91_TL00008"/>I write from Pompel after a visit to those two men of genius, the.<lb facs="P91_TL00009"/>brothers Vettil.<lb facs="P91_TL00010"/>How I came to meet them is simply told.<lb facs="P91_TL00011"/>I was last night at Scarpetta's theatre; that simpatico theatre in<lb facs="P91_TL00012"/>Naples where all that is to be laughed at is spread before us on the.<lb facs="P91_TL00013"/>stage and laughed in and out of existence without a thought too much to,<lb facs="P91_TL00014"/>oppress us. All the difference between this breed who give birth to laughter<lb facs="P91_TL00015"/>and the breed on the London stages whose cacklings even miscarry.,<lb facs="P91_TL00016"/>Scarpetta exists and we know he is of flesh and blood. Shaw to me<lb facs="P91_TL00017"/>does not live, and Is something other than flesh and blood.<lb facs="P91_TL00018"/>1 feel that had Dante condescended to write for the stage he would<lb facs="P91_TL00019"/>have produced just such a series of pleasant and unpleasant and popular<lb facs="P91_TL00020"/>comedies as G. B. S.<lb facs="P91_TL00021"/>*<lb facs="P91_TL00022"/>Another thing I feel about Scarpetta is that he wouldn't care a hang<lb facs="P91_TL00023"/>what his women said or thought about his plays, and 1 guess, (perhaps,<lb facs="P91_TL00024"/>wrongly), that the great brain laughter of Shaw is only quite ironic<lb facs="P91_TL00025"/>enough, only sufficiently deadly when it has received the full approval;<lb facs="P91_TL00026"/>of the Shaw ladies.<lb facs="P91_TL00027"/>By the way, I ought to tell you who Scarpetta is.<lb facs="P91_TL00028"/>He Is the author-actor of Naples, ...that is to say, one of our few real<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

His Improvisations have to deal with the Life of<lb facs="P91_TL00035"/>everyone. In the sharpest cut given the lash winds itself lazily round,<lb facs="P91_TL00036"/>the waist of the whole earth.'

                                    <lb facs="P92_TL00003"/>us? So I took my way the next morning to Pompei where, as I said, I<lb facs="P92_TL00004"/>was sure ot meeting my two friends, the brothers Vettii.<lb facs="P92_TL00005"/>Men 0( genius are real: through them all things become real. The<lb facs="P92_TL00006"/>highest Impossibility comes down from Heaven to them and the lowest<lb facs="P92_TL00007"/>fact comes up from Hell to them.<lb facs="P92_TL00008"/>They stand in a circle of strange phantoms become realities. And<lb facs="P92_TL00009"/>when 1 arrived at the house of the Vettii and had washed and rested<lb facs="P92_TL00010"/>myself I became aware of the strange and wonderful company which<lb facs="P92_TL00011"/>Scarpetta had sent me to seek.<lb facs="P92_TL00012"/>j£? His Introduction was not to actors nor to the director of the little<lb facs="P92_TL00013"/>Comic Theatre nor the poet of the larger Tragic Theatre,.., nor even to<lb facs="P92_TL00014"/>the celebrated Roman Dancer who is just now residing in Pompei and<lb facs="P92_TL00015"/>about whose performance in the Dancing Court ail Pompe! is talking.<lb facs="P92_TL00016"/>I saw her driving in the narrow streets and everybody turned to look at<lb facs="P92_TL00017"/>her as at something extraordinary. Even the barbers and chariot drivers<lb facs="P92_TL00018"/>stopped at their work a moment to look at this very celebrated performer.<lb facs="P92_TL00019"/>But it was to see none of these that Scarpetta the Neapolitan Improvisor<lb facs="P92_TL00020"/>beckoned me to go. And this is so like him, the unwashed actor from<lb facs="P92_TL00021"/>his grimy stage. As a worm on the mud-edge of some far off and forgotten<lb facs="P92_TL00022"/>lake, by instinct true and everlasting, and with unerring knowledge of<lb facs="P92_TL00023"/>what Is perfect, lifts his body slowly to some twig and, crawling up<lb facs="P92_TL00024"/>towards the sun, hangs suspended in Faith of what is to come and in<lb facs="P92_TL00025"/>the end throws out feeling wings of loveliness and with them floats off<lb facs="P92_TL00026"/>towards his god and his doom, so the unwashed actor beckoned me,<lb facs="P92_TL00027"/>i<lb facs="P92_TL00028"/>with Just such an indication of the direction I should take. And, as I<lb facs="P92_TL00029"/>walked along the side-street past the House of the Faun, a largo and<lb facs="P92_TL00030"/>finely silvered insect winged Its way ahead of me, turned to the right,<lb facs="P92_TL00031"/>then to the left, and at last settled upon the plllaster on which was an<lb facs="P92_TL00032"/>inscription, " The Ho jse of the Vettii. "<lb facs="P92_TL00033"/>Strange as it may seem It was not without apprehension that I entered<lb facs="P92_TL00034"/>the open door of their house.<lb facs="P92_TL00035"/>One or two things which 1 had noticed on my way through the streets<lb facs="P92_TL00036"/>o!

There<lb facs="P93_TL00007"/>were quite a number of queer signs,... and at times I had difficulty in<lb facs="P93_TL00008"/>telling myself that some catastrophe had not suddenly descended upon<lb facs="P93_TL00009"/>my friends,... nay, upon the whole city.<lb facs="P93_TL00010"/>JE?

The Theatre of Variety is today the crucible In which are stirring<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>the elements of a new sensibility which is coming into being. Therein is<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>found the ironic decomposition of all the ruined prototypes of the Beautiful,<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>the Great, the Solemn, the Religious, the Ferocious, the Seductive and<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>the Terrible, and also the abstract elaboration of the new prototypes<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>which shall succeed to these.<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>The Theatre of Variety is thus the synthesis of all that which humanity<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>has up till now refined in Its own nerves so as to divert itself in laughing<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>at material and moral suffering; it is, besides that, the ebullient fusion of<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>all the laughter, of all the smiles, of all the jeers, of all the contortions,<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>of all the raillery of future humanity. Therein may be tasted the gaiety<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>which will move men a hundred years hence, the researches of their<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>painting, of their philosophy, their minds and the upward springing of<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>their architecture.<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>6. The Theatre of Variety offers the most hygienic of all performances<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>owing to its dinamism of form and colour (simultaneous movement of<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>jugglers, dancers, gymnasts, varicoloured riding troupes). With its rhythm<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>of swift and langourous dance the Theatre of Variety forcibly draws the<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>slowest souls from their torpor and constrains them to run and leap.<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>It is, in fact, the only theatre in which the public does not remain<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>inert like a stupid onlooker, but noisily participates in the action, Itself<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>singing, accompanying the orchestra, communicating with the actor with<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>unexpected quips and extravagant dialogues.<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>The action is carried on at the same time on the stage, in the boxes<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>and in the pit. It then continues at the end of the performance, among<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>the battallions of admirers, sugary youths who crowd at the stage door<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>to dispute the star, final double victors;... a chic supper and bed.<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>7.

The Theatre of Variety is a school of heroism by reason of the<lb facs="P10_TL00008"/>different records of difficulty to overcome and efforts to be surpassed which<lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>create upon the stage the strong and sane atmosphere of danger. (For<lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>example, " Looping the loop " on a bicycle, in a motor car, on horseback).<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>&amp; 9. The Theatre of Variety Is a school of cerebral subtlety, complication<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>and synthesis by reason of its clowns, conjurers, thought readers, lightning<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>calculators, mechanicians, imitators and parodists, Its musical jugglers<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>and its eccentric Americans, whose fantastic pregnancies bring forth<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>incredible objects and mecchanisms.<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>10. The Variety Theatre is the only school which one can recommend<lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>*<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>to adolescents and young men of talent, because it explains in an incisive<lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>and rapid manner the most mysterious problems and the most complicated<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>political events.<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>&amp; For example: a year ago, at the Folies Bergfcre, two dancers were<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>representing the wavering discussions of Cambon with Kinderley-Watcher<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>on the question of Marocco and the Congo, by means of a symbolic and<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>significant dance which was worth at least three years of study of foreign<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>politics. The two dancers, turned towards the public, their arms interlaced,<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>the one close beside the other, went on making reciprocal concessions<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>of territory, leaping forwards and backwards, to right and to left, without<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>ever detaching themselves the one from the other, each keeping his eye<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>fixed upon the object in view, which was, each to entangle the other in<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>turn. They gave an impression of extreme courtesy, of skilful vacillation,<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>of ferocity, of diffidence, of obstinacy, of meticulousness unsurpassibly<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>diplomatic.<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>Besides, the Theatre of Variety explains and luminously illustrates<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>the dominant laws of life:<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>(a) the interweaving of divers rhythms.<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>(b) The fate of lies and contradictions (example; English double<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>faced dancers; shepherdess and terrible soldier).<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>(c) the synthesis of velocity plus transformations, (example, Fregoli).</ab>

Naturally the energetic electric light triumphs, and the soft and<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>decadent moonlight is put to rout.<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>&amp; 12. The Theatre of Variety Is naturally anti-academic, primitive and<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>ingenuous, hence the more significant owing to the unexpectedness of its<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>researches and the simplicity of its means. (Example), the systematic<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>turn of the stage which the chanteuses make, at the end of every<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>couplet, like wild beasts in a cage.<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>13. The Theatre of Variety destroys the Solemn, the Sacred, the<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>Serious, the Sublime of Art with a capital A. It collaborates in the<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>futurist destruction of the immortal masterpieces, plagiarising them,<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>parodying them, presenting them just anyhow, without scenery and<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>without compunction just as an ordinary " turn."

This Is incorrect: only last night 1 was at a circus and saw two<lb facs="P18_TL00004"/>clowns making use of this very isolated little gate thirty centimetres<lb facs="P18_TL00005"/>high. If it failed to destroy even the slight conception a human king has<lb facs="P18_TL00006"/>of time and of space, it succeeded in annihilating this conception of the<lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>Futurists. No more unfortunate example could have been chosen by<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>Signor Marlnetti.<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>&amp; Finally, 1 do heartily approve of this queer grim Manifesto: just as<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>I prefer even the "vulgar" side of the Variety Theatre to the "polite"<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>veneer of the legitimate stage. If mere " vulgarity " is outrageous, mere<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>politeness Is hopeless.<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>Futurismo in the Theatre can do no harm. More room for it, then.<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>Let it go 0n.., It must go 0n... we must get over it.<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>&amp; And It was a courageous sacrifice, and Marinetti and his friends<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>will one day be held In esteem. For Marinetti is in grim earnest about<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>something.<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>&amp; Signor Marinetti knows what he wants: he wants to stir up<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>everything, and we ought to hope that In spite of giving so much of<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>his time to politics, religion, and the other arts he will still have<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>a few hours a month to spare to the study of this by no means<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>easy art of ours and a share of attention for the questions relating to<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>its practise.<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>&amp; If our programme laid down more than seven years ago seems to<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>have excluded the suggestions of the Futurists, it was only that we were<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>unable to allow ourselves to " take sides. " Party politics are necessary,<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>but we needed not to make use of them.<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>Marinetti, digging frantically yet most gallantly with his spade, must<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>impel others to the same task. He turns sapping Into a fine art. Talking<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>is thrown away on a man occupied with a spade and the soil.

All the love I feel for him I should<lb facs="P23_TL00029"/>44 like to reveal in my painting of the picture. To begin with, then, 1<lb facs="P23_TL00030"/>44 paint him just as he is, as faithfully as possible... still this is only the<lb facs="P23_TL00031"/>44 beginning. The picture is by no means finished at this stage. Now I<lb facs="P23_TL00032"/>44 begin to apply the colour arbitrarily. I exaggerate the tone of his fair<lb facs="P23_TL00033"/>44 hair; I take orange, chrome, and dull lemon yellow. Behind his head,<lb facs="P23_TL00034"/>44 instead of the trivial wall of the room, 1 paint infinity. 1 make a<lb facs="P23_TL00035"/>44 simple backgronnd out of the richest of blues, as strong as my palette<lb facs="P23_TL00036"/>44 will allow.

These property men, or 'korombo,' from the<lb facs="P37_TL00025"/>Chikamatsu=za, the doll theatre of Osaka, cause the puppets to play the<lb facs="P37_TL00026"/>roles in Chikamatsu's famous pieces at the Yuraku-za.

It is full of haraklri, partings<lb facs="P39_TL00024"/>of lovers and stern soldiers who do not betray any of the softer emotions.<lb facs="P39_TL00025"/>Hideyoshi in armour on horseback makes a very triumphant figure, a<lb facs="P39_TL00026"/>whole company of korombo surrounding the horse and its rider, and<lb facs="P39_TL00027"/>when the animal begins to rear and caper to the strains of the samisen<lb facs="P39_TL00028"/>the property men act in such perfect unison that it is recognised that<lb facs="P39_TL00029"/>their art is indeed a wonderful one. Again, a dying warrior on the top<lb facs="P39_TL00030"/>of a stone moat wall makes a striking picture with back masked figures<lb facs="P39_TL00031"/>clustered as a background and the young lady of the piece is graceful<lb facs="P39_TL00032"/>and winsome, every movement full of modesty and gentleness. The second<lb facs="P39_TL00033"/>piece, Tsubosaka, tells the old story of the blind man who became jealous<lb facs="P39_TL00034"/>of his wife because of her frequent absences from home.

The<lb facs="P40_TL00007"/>opening scene of Tsubosaka shows O Sato sewing a kimono and all the<lb facs="P40_TL00008"/>details are faithfully reproduced while the blind husband plays on the<lb facs="P40_TL00009"/>samisen, and shows that the dolls can undertake the most minute and<lb facs="P40_TL00010"/>delicate gestures as well as the most boisterous and active. Kaniiji<lb facs="P40_TL00011"/>the third play is a shinju piece and was acted sometime ago at the<lb facs="P40_TL00012"/>Teikoku~za.<lb facs="P40_TL00013"/>It is the story of the faithful wife who gave up her money and her<lb facs="P40_TL00014"/>kimono that her husband might buy Koharu from the gay quarters and<lb facs="P40_TL00015"/>she and her child enter a nunnery to make him free. But Koharu and<lb facs="P40_TL00016"/>her lover are so overcome at the generous sacrifice of the wife that<lb facs="P40_TL00017"/>they die together. Imoseyama, the last piece, is also one of Chikamatsu's<lb facs="P40_TL00018"/>well known plays which has for theme the love of a common girl and a<lb facs="P40_TL00019"/>princess for a youth of high degree. This piece has an orchestra of five<lb facs="P40_TL00020"/>gidayu singers and as many samisen performers which makes an imposing<lb facs="P40_TL00021"/>array.<lb facs="P40_TL00022"/>&amp; The ancient art of the puppet has been wonderfully developed and<lb facs="P40_TL00023"/>preserved in this country, and perhaps in no other part of the world can<lb facs="P40_TL00024"/>the dolls be seen to such advantage. The nyngyo shibai is said to have<lb facs="P40_TL00025"/>originated In Kyoto in 1603. The puppet show was an ancient Institution<lb facs="P40_TL00026"/>before It appeared in Japan, and every European country has had its doll<lb facs="P40_TL00027"/>shows, but In all of them the art has degenerated. Punch and Judy are<lb facs="P40_TL00028"/>the last of their proud race in England.<lb facs="P40_TL00029"/>The doll theatre has greatly Influenced the theatre of Japan and<lb facs="P40_TL00030"/>much of the acting to be seen on the old stage at present shows the<lb facs="P40_TL00031"/>conventional style of the puppets. Although the nyngyo shibai was<lb facs="P40_TL00032"/>popular in all the cities of Japan for two hundred years, at present the<lb facs="P40_TL00033"/>doll theatre can only be seen in Osaka. Chikamatsu who is called the<lb facs="P40_TL00034"/>Shakespeare of Japan, wrote his famous plays for the puppets and these<lb facs="P40_TL00035"/>dramas are faithfully reserved in Osaka to=day. A company from the<lb facs="P40_TL00036"/>Chikamatsu-za of Osaka is now performing at the Yuraku=za and the<lb facs="P40_TL00037"/>performances are well worth a visit.</ab>

I hope you<lb facs="P50_TL00012"/>will agree with me that the object of education Is not to know, but to<lb facs="P50_TL00013"/>live. True it is that Browning's " Grammarian " is held up for admiration,<lb facs="P50_TL00014"/>because he " determined not to live, but know, but then he existed<lb facs="P50_TL00015"/>in the dawn of the revival of learning, and was an exceptional case, an<lb facs="P50_TL00016"/>intellectual pioneer; accordingly, if you remember, he suffered from<lb facs="P50_TL00017"/>baldness, tussis, calculus, and died, first from the waist down, and then<lb facs="P50_TL00018"/>altogether, at a comparatively early period of his career. My contention<lb facs="P50_TL00019"/>then is that we are in danger of trusting too much to books and systems,<lb facs="P50_TL00020"/>too little to the living influence of mind on mind ; too much to rapidity<lb facs="P50_TL00021"/>of learning, too little to development of power; that we are in danger<lb facs="P50_TL00022"/>of organizing the soul out of education, of making it mechanical and<lb facs="P50_TL00023"/>therefore barren •, of a tendency to look to the accumulation of facts as<lb facs="P50_TL00024"/>an adequate result, though they may lie like lead in the brain that bears<lb facs="P50_TL00025"/>them ; in a word, of confounding the mere capacity for housing mental<lb facs="P50_TL00026"/>goods with the growth of the vital powers conferred by education. "<lb facs="P50_TL00027"/>This was written by James Rhoades in his address which he delivered<lb facs="P50_TL00028"/>before a body consisting exclusively of public school masters. It was<lb facs="P50_TL00029"/>printed in 1908 by John Lane, with the title, *' The Training of the<lb facs="P50_TL00030"/>Imagination. "<lb facs="P50_TL00031"/>&amp; In the School for the Art of the Theatre we study hardly at all from<lb facs="P50_TL00032"/>books, and trust not at all to systems.<lb facs="P50_TL00033"/>&amp; What is our method ? We practise right away.<lb facs="P50_TL00034"/>It is a method which appeals not at all to incompetent men, and<lb facs="P50_TL00035"/>which instantly finds out for us which are practical and which unpractical<lb facs="P50_TL00036"/>workers. It also discovers for us the nature of the man.</ab>

If he<lb facs="P51_TL00026"/>sticks to his simple task until he has mastered it, he proves that we<lb facs="P51_TL00027"/>can rely on him in future. That he is worth taking trouble with,... worth<lb facs="P51_TL00028"/>all our patience.<lb facs="P51_TL00029"/>And each class resembles each other class in this respect.

If she were a man one would speak<lb facs="P58_TL00007"/>of her performances as " devilish clever".<lb facs="P58_TL00008"/>Hanako is a remarkable actress... and Hanako is not an artist at all.<lb facs="P58_TL00009"/>The actress Hanako should be put down by Law. Hanako the woman<lb facs="P58_TL00010"/>is doubtless valuable.<lb facs="P58_TL00011"/>No amount of brains ever made an artist... no amount of skill makes<lb facs="P58_TL00012"/>one either. Some artists are skilful and some are entirely without skill.<lb facs="P58_TL00013"/>Art is not a matter of skill, although the skilful artist is a Godsend.<lb facs="P58_TL00014"/>£? Skill astonishes. Art does not do that. A man can astound us whose<lb facs="P58_TL00015"/>flow of language cascades from point to point with a rapidity too great<lb facs="P58_TL00016"/>for us to follow, but he may not be speaking truth ; whereas the few<lb facs="P58_TL00017"/>words of a man of truth may easily be uttered, unheeded by us, a<lb facs="P58_TL00018"/>thousand times in a year.<lb facs="P58_TL00019"/>This is such an obvious fact that we have accepted it long ago... yet<lb facs="P58_TL00020"/>in the Theatre we forget it.<lb facs="P58_TL00021"/>I have seen an audience, half Italian and half English, go into raptures<lb facs="P58_TL00022"/>over Hanako and her exhibition of suicide in all its realistic details.<lb facs="P58_TL00023"/>The beastly preparation for death... the horrible sticking of the knife<lb facs="P58_TL00024"/>in the throat... the mouth first filled with torn=up paper... and the<lb facs="P58_TL00025"/>loathsome gush of scarlet blood half covering the white chemise... saw<lb facs="P58_TL00026"/>her take her " call " at the end, and, while many applauded, I noticed<lb facs="P58_TL00027"/>one man with his hands raised and laid back on each side of him, making<lb facs="P58_TL00028"/>a significant gesture to the performer which seemed to ask..*., " Well!<lb facs="P58_TL00029"/>and what then have you done ? Is that what you truly believe to be<lb facs="P58_TL00030"/>good for us... for yourself... for the Theatre ? " I think he was a member<lb facs="P58_TL00031"/>of the European Theatre. He knew how great an evil poor Hanako was<lb facs="P58_TL00032"/>unconsciously perpetrating.<lb facs="P58_TL00033"/>And as acting... as a skilful piece of work... was it good ?<lb facs="P58_TL00034"/>Yes, as melodramatic realism it was good. She easily beat Madame<lb facs="P58_TL00035"/>Sarah Bernhardt on her own ground. Sardou would have revelled in her</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P59_TB00003">
                                    <lb facs="P59_TL00003"/>as a tool, had Hanako been a Frenchwoman. But because she is to be<lb facs="P59_TL00004"/>compared with Sarah Bernhardt and because Sardou would have used<lb facs="P59_TL00005"/>her is the very worst of arguments in her favour.<lb facs="P59_TL00006"/>Some day we shall realise these things in Europe. Legislation will<lb facs="P59_TL00007"/>move to control the questions of circus and people, and without any<lb facs="P59_TL00008"/>traces of the *' embarassment " shown in the Code of Theodosius. For<lb facs="P59_TL00009"/>Legislators will take counsel with artists of rigorous conscience and not<lb facs="P59_TL00010"/>with priests of may-be narrow minds.<lb facs="P59_TL00011"/>&amp; The whole art of the East is contrary to realism. In Japanese painting,<lb facs="P59_TL00012"/>we are told by Hokusai, form and colour are represented without any<lb facs="P59_TL00013"/>attempt at relief. Hokusai would have hated Hanako.<lb facs="P59_TL00014"/>It is not only the " aesthetes " who have used tall talk about Art.<lb facs="P59_TL00015"/>The Artists have done so. Don't let us forget this.<lb facs="P59_TL00016"/>The Artist knows, and has stated plenty of times, that mankind has<lb facs="P59_TL00017"/>a longing for the stars, and you may jeer at this tallness till kingdom<lb facs="P59_TL00018"/>come ...it is the Truth, and the world, while men and women still have<lb facs="P59_TL00019"/>the stars over their heads, and while they still see them, will have an<lb facs="P59_TL00020"/>indefinable longing for them.<lb facs="P59_TL00021"/>And mankind loves the mountains... the peaks, and loves the depths<lb facs="P59_TL00022"/>of the sea... loves the secluded spots which he cannot reach.<lb facs="P59_TL00023"/>£? Wherever he cannot climb... whatever he cannot touch... whatever<lb facs="P59_TL00024"/>he is shut out from... that will he long for.<lb facs="P59_TL00025"/>In most men the longing is for the indescribable and unrealizable.<lb facs="P59_TL00026"/>And Artists are those men who know something mysterious and who<lb facs="P59_TL00027"/>bring mankind through their art something of what it has longed, and<lb facs="P59_TL00028"/>longs for.<lb facs="P59_TL00029"/>Hanako would have us believe a pack of lies. She and all her tribe<lb facs="P59_TL00030"/>would swindle us into the horrible belief that all we want is Suicide...<lb facs="P59_TL00031"/>and a nasty squabble in this house of ours. And she would doubtless<lb facs="P59_TL00032"/>back up her skilful performance with the argument that it is " true<lb facs="P59_TL00033"/>to life ".<lb facs="P59_TL00034"/>&amp; What life, Madam?

                                    <lb facs="P72_TL00003"/>\*/arsaw, once the capital of Poland, at present under the rule of<lb facs="P72_TL00004"/>Russia, might not be considered a likely place for the encouragement<lb facs="P72_TL00005"/>of the arts theatrical or otherwise.<lb facs="P72_TL00006"/>A recent visit in connection with an Interesting and very up-to-date<lb facs="P72_TL00007"/>theatre exhibition has given me a new point of view regarding things<lb facs="P72_TL00008"/>Polish, for I found that the theatre in Warsaw plays a most important<lb facs="P72_TL00009"/>part in the lives of the inhabitants. It reflects their brain, temperament<lb facs="P72_TL00010"/>and soul as a clear lake of Poland mirrors its solemn trees.<lb facs="P72_TL00011"/>Of the theatres 1 visited, only one, the Teatr Polski, may be said to<lb facs="P72_TL00012"/>be modern. But this particular little theatre is a model of what a theatre<lb facs="P72_TL00013"/>ought to be constructionally.<lb facs="P72_TL00014"/>There Is no playhouse anywhere in England half so ingeniously, so<lb facs="P72_TL00015"/>serenely and so beautifully appointed.<lb facs="P72_TL00016"/>Of the play at the Polish Theatre, which happened to be " The<lb facs="P72_TL00017"/>Tempest, " I can say nothing. The performance of it was interesting but<lb facs="P72_TL00018"/>not In any way absorbing. Perhaps Shakespeare in Polish loses greatly ?<lb facs="P72_TL00019"/>Although, some Poles I spoke with, who were very familiar with English,<lb facs="P72_TL00020"/>said that the translation I heard was a very beautiful one by an eminent<lb facs="P72_TL00021"/>native poet. It was not the fault of the actors. On the whole they did<lb facs="P72_TL00022"/>well, particularly Stefano and Trinculo, who managed to catch a good<lb facs="P72_TL00023"/>deal of the rich English habit. Nor was it entirely the fault of Karol<lb facs="P72_TL00024"/>Prycz the designer of the costumes and scenery,<lb facs="P72_TL00025"/>Frycz is a young man of talent, judging from a model scene of his<lb facs="P72_TL00026"/>In the Theatre Exhibition; but I imagine that in " The Tempest" he<lb facs="P72_TL00027"/>was not on native ground,... that is, he had not a free hand.<lb facs="P72_TL00028"/>It seemed as though the producer had said to him, " Here are some<lb facs="P72_TL00029"/>back numbers of Jugend, make your scene as much in the Munich style<lb facs="P72_TL00030"/>of landscape as possible.... here also are Dora's Illustrations to ' Contes<lb facs="P72_TL00031"/>drolatiques,' get your men's costumes from them. "<lb facs="P72_TL00032"/>I feel this very strongly, for Frycz is a most promising man and the<lb facs="P72_TL00033"/>work of his hands unembarassed by the wishes or instructions of managers<lb facs="P72_TL00034"/>or producers is of a purer and more original character.<lb facs="P72_TL00035"/>The producer at any rate was to blame for allowing Ariel to be played</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P73_TL00007"/>formance was Caliban. No actor, be he even better than the excellent<lb facs="P73_TL00008"/>one who played this part, could possibly realise Caliban in a fantastical<lb facs="P73_TL00009"/>dress which, as nearly as I can describe it, looked like a grotesque mixture<lb facs="P73_TL00010"/>of an American cowboy and a narwhal. The heavy German influence got<lb facs="P73_TL00011"/>its grip on the whole work, and,... Shakespeare died to slow Munich.<lb facs="P73_TL00012"/>&amp;It was of course a bad policy to run such a play on entirely realistic<lb facs="P73_TL00013"/>lines, but it had one episode which was really diverting.<lb facs="P73_TL00014"/>The scene was built up " solid " and in the drunken bout the whole<lb facs="P73_TL00015"/>land and seascape solemnly twirled about the revellers. Trees, rocks,<lb facs="P73_TL00016"/>sand and sea gravely waltzing round from left to right.<lb facs="P73_TL00017"/>Not realism this, but most excellent suggestion. The spectators<lb facs="P73_TL00018"/>were made to feel and see as the characters were supposed to be feeling<lb facs="P73_TL00019"/>and seeing. They entered Into Stefano's and Trlnculo's world instead of<lb facs="P73_TL00020"/>observing them from another planet. It was a capital utilisation of the<lb facs="P73_TL00021"/>resources of the revolving stage.<lb facs="P73_TL00022"/>The company of actors at the Summer Theatre (Teatr w ogrodzie<lb facs="P73_TL00023"/>Saskim) were, taken all round, much more capable than those at the<lb facs="P73_TL00024"/>Teatr Polski. Here 1 might, had I space, make many agreeable comparisons<lb facs="P73_TL00025"/>between actors trained in the old stock tradition and those of the modern<lb facs="P73_TL00026"/>repertory type. Briefly, it seems to me that each could learn a lot from<lb facs="P73_TL00027"/>the other.<lb facs="P73_TL00028"/>The only English Repertory companies with whose work 1 am at all<lb facs="P73_TL00029"/>familiar are those of Manchester and Liverpool, and it has almost<lb facs="P73_TL00030"/>invariably been the case that these companies when playing an old<lb facs="P73_TL00031"/>romantic play lack something of warmth and mellowness.<lb facs="P73_TL00032"/>Most of all they lack sympathy and that kind of belief which springs<lb facs="P73_TL00033"/>from an inborn and whole-souled joy in theatrical make-believe. They<lb facs="P73_TL00034"/>are too brainy, too matter-of-fact, too intellectual and sometimes too<lb facs="P73_TL00035"/>lofty to be simple. They do not radiate a glow from within; rather<lb facs="P73_TL00036"/>they are illumined by a cold light thrown on them from without.<lb facs="P73_TL00037"/>Whereas, on the other hand, the old style of actors who think Ibsen</ab>

They have little or no<lb facs="P74_TL00006"/>difficulty in getting the play across the footlights to the audience,<lb facs="P74_TL00007"/>When dealing with a sociological or philosophic or intellectual play<lb facs="P74_TL00008"/>their limitations show up like the 44 spots that bespatter the leopard."<lb facs="P74_TL00009"/>One could not imagine them playing Monkhouse's " Mary Broome. "<lb facs="P74_TL00010"/>&amp; Nevertheless It is to the latter class of players that most of the<lb facs="P74_TL00011"/>Theatre companies of Warsaw belong. Those at the summer theatre<lb facs="P74_TL00012"/>supremely so.<lb facs="P74_TL00013"/>Their play-house Is a big wooden structure built in the middle of a<lb facs="P74_TL00014"/>beautiful old garden full of noble trees with winding paths leading into<lb facs="P74_TL00015"/>glades all round about.<lb facs="P74_TL00016"/>The play, Rostand's 44 Romantics was a most appropriate piece for<lb facs="P74_TL00017"/>such a situation. A better company of actors of the old style I have never<lb facs="P74_TL00018"/>seen. The great comedian Frenkiel playing Straforel was in most won<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P74_TL00019"/>derful form, and I can believe what I am told, namely, that when he<lb facs="P74_TL00020"/>plays Cyrano de Bergerac it is almost if not quite as good as Coquelin's.<lb facs="P74_TL00021"/>4? Altogether a joyous performance with the added delight at the end<lb facs="P74_TL00022"/>of leaving a Fragonard stage picture to walk through the ancient theatre<lb facs="P74_TL00023"/>garden with the first leaves of autumn falling from the trees.<lb facs="P74_TL00024"/>&amp; At the Teatr Nowoscl Sumurun was playing to half-crowded houses.<lb facs="P74_TL00025"/>Evidently it traded on its reputation to draw people, for a more stupid<lb facs="P74_TL00026"/>performance could not be imagined.<lb facs="P74_TL00027"/>In justice to Herr Reinhardt it should be stated that the Warsaw<lb facs="P74_TL00028"/>version was not his. It was jostled and hurried, not one gesture was<lb facs="P74_TL00029"/>well thought out and grouping, even 44 effective grouping," was not<lb facs="P74_TL00030"/>thought of for a moment, it was like a Christy minstrel's playing of<lb facs="P74_TL00031"/>a tambourine... full of harshness, rattle and dither and bang.<lb facs="P74_TL00032"/>&amp; The largest theatre in Warsaw in the Teatr Wielki. At the time of my<lb facs="P74_TL00033"/>visit they were presenting 44 L'Aiglon " and it was very pleasant to find<lb facs="P74_TL00034"/>the comedian Frenkiel In the piece playing Flambeau in his own particular<lb facs="P74_TL00035"/>racy manner. These were several actors of very marked Individuality, and<lb facs="P74_TL00036"/>prominent among them was Juljusz Osterwa, very graceful in person and<lb facs="P74_TL00037"/>endowed with a most unusual instinct for movement and gesture.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P75_TL00007"/>ring from one spot. But he made great drama out of his part and one<lb facs="P75_TL00008"/>could not help thinking that with a few actors of his calibre play after<lb facs="P75_TL00009"/>play could be interpreted quite easily without the use of the spoken word.<lb facs="P75_TL00010"/>This Teatr Wielki is a huge place and is used generally for grand<lb facs="P75_TL00011"/>opera and spectacle.<lb facs="P75_TL00012"/>It does things, not by halves, but by one and a half, or even more.<lb facs="P75_TL00013"/>It adds, two and two together and makes seven. In presenting "L'Aiglon"<lb facs="P75_TL00014"/>it seemed as though it said, " Here is a play which demands a certain<lb facs="P75_TL00015"/>amount of realism.

                                    <lb facs="P75_TL00018"/>cently and astonishingly complete. But in spite of its dazzling opulence<lb facs="P75_TL00019"/>It was never gaudy, garish nor in any way ugly. It was delusion and<lb facs="P75_TL00020"/>not illusion and, as was to be expected, it utterly swamped the play and<lb facs="P75_TL00021"/>the players. The drama struggled to keep its head up as a swimmer<lb facs="P75_TL00022"/>would struggle in a lily-clogged lake. Only one scene escaped drowning,<lb facs="P75_TL00023"/>and by some means arrived at real simplicity. In this scene the drama<lb facs="P75_TL00024"/>took its last breath and then went under. It was particularly interesting<lb facs="P75_TL00025"/>to see such a production as it showed that the great theatre .could be<lb facs="P75_TL00026"/>ideal, if it liked, as well as real, or rather unreal.<lb facs="P75_TL00027"/>&amp; The ideal theatre building in Warsaw is the one 1 have already<lb facs="P75_TL00028"/>mentioned, the Teatr Polski where they played " The Tempest. " Later<lb facs="P75_TL00029"/>1 saw them play another piece there, " Damy i Huzary " which was<lb facs="P75_TL00030"/>much more within the scope of the actors.<lb facs="P75_TL00031"/>&amp; What interested me most about this new Polish Theatre was the<lb facs="P75_TL00032"/>fact that the building of the structure had been done with brains and<lb facs="P75_TL00033"/>imagination. Prom the ventilating apparatus to the costumes of the<lb facs="P75_TL00034"/>attendants everything seemed to be the result of clear thought and<lb facs="P75_TL00035"/>inspiration. Light In plenty,, but hidden and never striking uncomfortably<lb facs="P75_TL00036"/>on the eye. Every seat with an excellent and unobstructed view of the<lb facs="P75_TL00037"/>stage. None of the stuffy feeling,.., the wanting to get up ajid go out<lb facs="P75_TL00038"/>for air at the end of an act. The temperature did not perceptibly rise</ab>

They have a<lb facs="P76_TL00022"/>lot of labour in front of them, but they have got the ideal building and<lb facs="P76_TL00023"/>they have got talent. One member of this group, Franz Siedlecki, has<lb facs="P76_TL00024"/>not had the opportunity of materialising his designs but his work is<lb facs="P76_TL00025"/>full of spiritual beauty and suggestion and his day must come soon. He<lb facs="P76_TL00026"/>and his Cracow friend, Leon de Schildenfeld et Schiller, were responsible<lb facs="P76_TL00027"/>for the practical organisation of the splendid little Exhibition at Warsaw.<lb facs="P76_TL00028"/>&amp; It is interesting to hear this group of enthusiasts talking of the<lb facs="P76_TL00029"/>celebrated ancient and modern plays of various countries but it is almost<lb facs="P76_TL00030"/>startling to hear Poles speak of the mystical strange beauty and lyricism<lb facs="P76_TL00031"/>of W.

They have read them and intend playing them in<lb facs="P76_TL00032"/>what 1 am informed are beautiful translations by an inspired young<lb facs="P76_TL00033"/>Polish poet.<lb facs="P76_TL00034"/>They know also to whom is due the credit of the modern movement<lb facs="P76_TL00035"/>in the European Theatre and that is why they organized and opened at<lb facs="P76_TL00036"/>Warsaw an exhibition of modern theatre art with the designs and models<lb facs="P76_TL00037"/>of Gordon Craig occupying the place of honour.</ab>

In fact the man who succeeds in the eyes of the world is often simply he who best<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>applies the talents and learning of his predecessor whose name never came before the public<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>at all. It may be trite to repeat that 44 the world knows nothing of its greatest men " but<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>It is certainly true that the Theatre does not, probably because it has shaped and accepted<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>so false an ideal of what qualifies a man as "great". jg?<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>&amp; It assumes Its greatest men to be the most popular actors, the most successful managers,<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>the most expert financiers, the most brilliant playwrights ; whereas they are rather those<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>who have rendered the most valuable services to the Art of the Theatre as a whole, not<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>only by the talents they have devoted to it, but by the love they have felt for it and the<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>consequent thoroughness with which they studied and performed every smallest detail of<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>their work.<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>&amp; One of the most remarkable among these 44 great men " of the modern theatre was<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>E. W. Godwin. He ft was who, in a sense not as yet fully realised, fathered the new move<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Such a man was E. W. Godwin.<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>The friend of Whistler, of Burgess the architect, of William Morris and Burne-Jones;<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>the designer of many beautiful buildings, including the Town Hal! at Northampton and the<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>White House at Chelsea which he built for Whistler, he was a distinguished architect,<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>deeply cultured, a reader of Shakespearean verse who understood in an exceptional degree<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>the value of that verse, a Fellow of the Royal Society, a man possessed of wide learning<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>and a keen love of the theatre and its art.<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>The whole story of his life, of his many and varied activities, of the brilliant group of<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>which he formed a member, is an interesting one, and some day to be written of fully;<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>but the present note can only briefly outline his work for the theatre, the talents which he<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>devoted to it and the great services which he rendered gratuitously to the stage.<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>The question may, of course, be put, Why should an architect, a man who, one thinks,<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>could know nothing of the theatre, concern himself with an art other than his own ? It<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>would seem at first sight something of an intrusion ... one of those intrusions the repulsion<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>of which The Mask has always advocated: it would seem rather hasty... as hasty as the<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>act of the modern designers who, without any knowledge of the theatre except that which<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>they have borrowed, (as who should say 44 Lend me half-a-crown "), press forward to the<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>dangerous and delightful work.<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>&amp; But with E. W. Godwin there was neither haste nor presumption; with him the theatre<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>was the study of a lifetime. Loving it sincerely, he elected, after very many years, to come<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>forward and offer it some assistance: the theatre accepted the assistance, and, as I have<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>already said, forgot the giver.<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>Oliver Wendal Holmes once wrote 44 A man's learning dies with him ; even his virtues<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>44 fade out of remembrance; but the dividends on the stocks he bequeathes to his children<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>44 keep his memory green"; but even this was not so in Godwin's case. His theatrical suc<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>cessors have enjoyed the dividends ... and forgotten to whom they were indebted for the<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>stocks. In fact Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree has been, in the long space of time since Godwin's<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>death, one of the only persons connected with the theatre to pay homage to his memory,<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>and he, in a speech in 1900 before the Oxford Debating Society, bore witness how well<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>Godwin's methods paid commercially; for, though in his defence of that method he very<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>properly added that he did not set up commercial success as a standard by which artistic<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>success may be guaged, he stated as an interesting fact that 242,000 people witnessed his<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>own production of 44 Julius Caesar ", 170,000 witnessed 44 King John " and nearly 220,000<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>44 A Midsummer Night's Dream", and these people were undoubtedly attracted to the theatre<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>by Sir Herbert's method of staging Shakespeare in the manner inaugurated by Godwin.<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>As to that method itself, I can here say only a few words.<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>Having in his qualifications to help the theatre something in common with those other<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>distinguished architects, Serlio, Palladio and Inigo Jones, who lent their talents to its<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>service, E. W. Godwin added a wide learning and a keen perception of beauty which aroused<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>him to a wise discontent with the existing conditions of the stage in his day and enlisted<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>all his energies for their betterment. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>As to the theory upon which his practise was based, it seems to be summed up in a<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>sentence written by him regarding the pictures of the Royal Academy in 1865 where he<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>says, 44 The accessories in pictures, whether on canvas or on the stage, should be altogether<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>wrong or wholly right". &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>This suggestion that they may be altogether 44 wrong", that is to say, incorrect, is very<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>illuminating for it shows that he realised that in the art of the theatre accuracy of detail<lb facs="P6_TL00056"/>is of no importance whatever provided it be entirely inaccurate. But one or the other,<lb facs="P6_TL00057"/>wholly right or altogether wrong.... he claimed that these accessories should be.

In Godwin we have a man who studied the theatre as did<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>no other of his day.

It Is with additional pleasure therefore that we now find ourselves<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>able to reproduce also a series of Godwin's designs for stage costumes and properties, the<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>rst three of which appear in the present number of The Mask.

A picture, painted by Mr H. M. Paget in 1886,<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>shows how this theatre with its chorus of Greek women and its principal characters, scene,<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>light and properties, looked; and, for all its accuracy, the primary impression created is not<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>so much of something correct as of something beautiful. The scene and the figures have<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>beautiful proportions and the whole makes a simple appeal. It seems to have unity, ... a<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>natural result of being the work of one artist instead of the joint production of a number<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>of incompetent tradesmen.<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>Another production was Mr Wilson Barrett's 44 Hamletand yet another the charming<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>open air performance of 44 As You Like It" at Coo mbe Wood.<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>Now if Godwin had received the support which was delayed until it was too late to be<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>of use to him,.... that is to say, if during his lifetime the Theatre had done him<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>the full justice which his work deserved he would have lived to enrich the<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>stage with many more such productions, and the stage, in its turn, would have enriched<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>him. He would then have become famous in his own day and it would not be unknown to<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>nearly everyone who reads this that he, and no other, was the initiator (1) of that suc»<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>cessful movement in the theatre which proved its worth artistically and commercially both<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>in the Lyceum productions and In those which have followed them; the inaugurator of a<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>method which, although it has since in England degenerated into too florid a style, has<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>found its logical sequence in the new movement in the European theatre of today.<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>Nowadays we are all familiar with those historical productions which are correct and<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>charming in their presentation, and may now expect to pass forward to the next step. Such<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>productions served as the natural link to connect the theatre of forty years ago with its<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>plush curtains and its early Victorian costumes, its ugliness as well as its incorrectness,<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>with the theatre of the immediate tomorrow, which is bound to be that theatre in which,<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>as Godwin says, 44 the accessories and costumes shall be altogether wrong",.... that is<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>ideal creations, fair with that beauty of the 44 Poet's Dream" which 44 never was on land<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>or sea&amp; &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>His work was the natural realistic link between the unimaginative and the imaginative.<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>In the immediate tomorrow comes the next link in which the accessories shall be not<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>correct in date but correct in spirit; when we shall not realise but suggest.

I have told you so repeatedly but you were so quick<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>with your questions you would not let me tell you something which saves the situation.<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>That design, as I have just said, is made to give you a certain impression. When I make the<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>same scene on the stage it is sure to be quite different in form and colour but it will create<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>the same impression on you as this design in front of you now.<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>Manager.

All artists are "original"<lb facs="P12_TL00007"/>to business men and all business men are " original " to artists; both can truthfully be<lb facs="P12_TL00008"/>called eccentrics. This is as it should be. The mistake is for either of them to try and un«<lb facs="P12_TL00009"/>derstand how the other works. Each should remain Ignorant of the other's methods and<lb facs="P12_TL00010"/>should unite to a common madness called the 44 concentric ". This would be very productive.<lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>Sometimes we get a man who Is both artist and business man: Cecil Rhodes was such a<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>man. He used the soil of a Continent as a sculptor uses a handful of clay and from it he<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>fashioned United South Africa, and we shall probably learn in time that he made something<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>even vaster than that. Learn to risk, my friend ; and learn also that Ideas are rare things,<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>and are seldom known to fail and that most artists are packed full of ideas. Therefore the<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>artist Is the finest of all mines for the business man to work.<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>&amp; Manager &lt;£? But what if an idea doesn't pay?<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>Artist &amp; An idea which doesn't pay has never yet been discovered. If you don't know<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>how to make it pay that is not a matter I can interfere in for that but reveals your igno=<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>ranee of how to handle it. In that case you fail at your own game,... but the idea has not<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>failed. It waits for some one better fitted to develop it.<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>Manager SO you put the whole blame of failure on the manager or business man,<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>not on the artist?<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>Artist Yes, on the handling, especially in the case of a very original idea. With<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>ordinary ideas it is somewhat different. Ordinary ideas are generally rather weak and then<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>the only blame which can be attached to the business man is that he wasted too much time and<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>money on working a poor field. The rare fields are the valuable ones, and in the realms of<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>art the rarest field is that where the most original idea is buried. Let a shrewd business<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>man stake all he has on that field ... with patience arid determination it will yield him all<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>he desires.^<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>&amp; Manager Yes,...... but to return to practical matters.<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>Artist I had never departed from them. &lt;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>Manager I am speaking of this design for a scene which strikes me as quite<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>wonderful. How are we to realise that on the stage ? &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>Artist. To answer your question 1 must first ask you another. If we were standing<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>on the edge of a rich gold field and long veins of pure gold were proved to be lying buried<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>under your very nose, and 1 were to ask you how to 44 realise " that gold, would you not<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>answer me that the ore was not of practical commercial value until extracted, washed,<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>removed to the mint and coined ?... in fact changed entirely from its present entrancing<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>condition and transformed into another, yet equally valuable, condition and form ? Well, 1<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>answer you in the same way about this scene. And what is more, I advise you to work the mine<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>from which that design came and it will yield you all that you desire. But don't attempt<lb facs="P12_TL00043"/>the task with one pick and a shovel. Put money into it,.... all your money.... don't be<lb facs="P12_TL00044"/>frightened. 1 happen to be a man with imagination and in art that is the equivalent of a<lb facs="P12_TL00045"/>gold mine; it only needs to be properly worked. JZ? &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>&amp; You will say I have no false modesty about myself. Certainly not, Sir; the best artists<lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>since time Immemorial have always known how to value their powers. Fools call it conceit<lb facs="P12_TL00048"/>but wise men know differently.<lb facs="P12_TL00049"/>Manager. Why have not business men done as you suggest before now?<lb facs="P12_TL00050"/>&amp; Artist. They have. They did so in the fifteenth century; the Renaissance could not<lb facs="P12_TL00051"/>have happened without them. They did so in Athens; they did so in Egypt; they will do so<lb facs="P12_TL00052"/>in America. In fact they have always done so except when a wave of timidity has swept<lb facs="P12_TL00053"/>over the earth and created a panic. We are just emerging from such a wave.<lb facs="P12_TL00054"/>Manager. And now you expect to see everyone spending money upon works of art ?<lb facs="P12_TL00055"/>Artist. &amp; Certainly 1 expect to see shrewd business men investing their money in<lb facs="P12_TL00056"/>ideas; and as ideas are the property of men of imagination I expect to see these two types<lb facs="P12_TL00057"/>of men, artist and business man, combine and place good things before the public instead<lb facs="P12_TL00058"/>of worthless things. In many instances good things are already before the public; but in the<lb facs="P12_TL00059"/>branch of public service in which we are engaged you must agree with me, (knowing what</ab>

Why can't you<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>invent some more reliable answers than "It does't pay " and " "I give the public what it<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>demands " ?

You should know quite well that the Public is so vast, is<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>composed of so many different classes and types, its tastes varying with each type, that it<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>is sheer lunacy to assert that there is no public for works of art. <lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>It is as much as to say that the public is incapable of appreciation. If this were so how<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>would you explain how it is that the public knows the difference between a good loaf of<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>bread and a bad one ? or explain how it is that the public can discern a good day from a<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>rainy day,. .. how it knows a good song and a good horse from a bad song and horse? And<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>remember that the public knows everything which is good from everything which is bad ;<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>in fact the public is as right as rain ; let us hear no more criticisms of it. If you choose to<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>criticise a small section of the public that is another matter, especially if you choose that<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>small section which grumbles at the nation's best soldiers, sailors, statesmen, judges, doctors,<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>priests and artists.

And you call that handful of the<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>nation "the Public".<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>Manager &amp; You do not convince me. I am certain that if the Public wanted works of<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>art it would create a demand for them. &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>Artist My dear Sir, you encourage me. You say the very thing I wanted you to say.<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>"To create a demand ". You realise that a public demand is created and does not create<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>itself. You realise that the Nation entrusts certain of its officers with the different tasks<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>of creating this, that and the other, and amongst these other things is the " creating a<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>demand". The Public cannot speak for itself; if the whole lot speak at once no one is<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>heard ; if one man speaks he is not listened to unless he is elected as spokesman by the<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>whole nation.

Therefore until it does elect some representative how shall we know its<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>wishes ? <lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>jg? Manager But two hundred thousand men and women visited His Majesty's Theatre<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>to see "Julius Caesar" and thereby acclaim Sir Herbert Tree as their spokesman. j&amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>&amp; Artist &amp; Two hundred thousand people are not the Public, and the directors of the<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>public taste in theatrical matters are self=elected.

But this the stage manager never seems to<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>realise, for did he do so he would adopt a very different method for the interpretation<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>of those scenes in which the ghosts appear. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; j£r &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>For what is it makes the ghosts of Shakespeare, which are so significant and impressive<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>when we read the plays, appear so weak and unconvincing on the stage ?

In<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>fact with the exit of the ghost on the stage the audience may be said to feel that some=<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>thing best not spoken about has been passed over. And so the mighty question, which is<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>at the roots of the whole world, of life and death, that fine theme ever productive of so<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>much beauty and "from which Shakespeare weaves his veils, is slurred over... avoided as<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>with an apologetic cough. &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>We are children In such matters.

(a)<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>The whole success of its representation depends upon the power of the stage manager to<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>suggest this preternatural agency and on the capacity of the actor to submit to the tide<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>of the play, to that mysterious mesmerism which masters Macbeth and his "troop of friends".<lb facs="P16_TL00052"/>d? 1 seem to see him in the first four Acts of the play as a man who is hypnotised, seldom<lb facs="P16_TL00053"/>moving, but, when he does so, moving as a sleep walker. Later on in the play the places<lb facs="P16_TL00054"/>are changed and Lady Macbeth's sleep-walking is like the grim ironical echo of Macbeth's<lb facs="P16_TL00055"/>whole life, a sharp shrill echo quickly growing fainter ... fainter ... and gone. &amp; jg?<lb facs="P16_TL00056"/>jg? In the last act Macbeth awakes. It almost seems to be a new role. Instead of a sleep walker<lb facs="P16_TL00057"/>dragging his feet heavily he becomes an ordinary man startled from a dream to find the<lb facs="P16_TL00058"/>dream true.

                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>ing something quite new I am speaking entirely in relation to the interpretation of<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>Shakespeare on the stage and not merely as his student. I know that the students have<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>written about these spirits comparing them to certain figures in the Greek tragedy and<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>writing of them far more profoundly than I can do. But their writings are for those who<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>read Shakespeare, or who see him acted, not for those who take part in the presentation<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>of his plays. Whether the plays were ever intended to be acted or no, whether or not they<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>gain by being acted, does not concern me here. But If 1 were asked to present this play,<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>of " Macbeth " upon the stage, 1 should need to bring to It an understanding different<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>entirely from that which the student brings when he has only himself to consider as he<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>sits reading It in private. You may feel the presence of these witches as you read the play<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>but which of you has ever felt their presence when you saw the play acted? And therein<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>lies the failure of the producer and the actor.<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>&amp; In - Macbeth," it Is, to my mind, during the hypnotic moments that we should feel<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>the overpowering force of these unseen agencies, and how to make this, felt, how to<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>make it clear and yet not actual, Is the problem of the stage manager. To me it seems<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>that the play has never yet been properly performed because we have never yet felt these<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>spirits working through the woman at the man, and to achieve this would be one of the<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>most difficult tasks which could be set the stage manager, though not because of the<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>difficulty of purchasing gauze which should be sufficiently transparent, not because of the<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>difficulty of finding machinery capable of raising the ghosts or any other such reason. The<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>chief difficulty lies with the two performers of the roles of Lady Macbeth and Macbeth,<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>for if it is admitted that this spiritual element which Shakespeare called the Witches and<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>Ghosts Is In any way connected with the pain of these two beings, Macbeth and his Lady,<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>then these two characters must show this to the audience. &amp; j&amp; jp<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>0 But, while it rests with the actors of these two parts, it also rests with the actors of<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>the witches, and above all with the stage manager, to bring these spirits and their me<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Here we have the idea of the supreme God, the supreme Love, and it is that<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>which has to be brought into "Macbeth " on the stage. We see in this instance the God of<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>Force as exemplified in these witches, placing these two pieces of mortality upon the anvil<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>and crushing them because they were not hard enough to resist; consuming them because they<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>could not stand the fire: offering the woman a crown for her husband, flattering her<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>beyond measure, whispering to her of her superior force, of her superior intellect; whispering<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>to him of his bravery.<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>See how persuasively the spirits can work upon the man or the woman when separated<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>and alone! listen to the flow of their language; they are drunk with the force of these<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>spirits though unaware of their presence. &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>But note the moment when these two come together.

" each becomes furtive, alert, fearful, on<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>the defensive, and so there is no outpouring of speech here, but their meeting is like the<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>cautious approach of two animals.<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>What is it they see ? the spirit which clings round the feet or hangs upon the neck, or,<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>as in the old Durer picture, is whispering in the ear ?

That<lb facs="P20_TL00043"/>cathedral has not been built in a year or even in two; it has taken at least ten years<lb facs="P20_TL00044"/>to build, probably longer; yet it has been open for six or seven years: and so it was with<lb facs="P20_TL00045"/>the great cathedrals of the Midde Ages save that many more than ten or twice ten years went<lb facs="P20_TL00046"/>to their completion.<lb facs="P20_TL00047"/>Therefore when we decide to build our Memorial Theatre let us think of it as though<lb facs="P20_TL00048"/>we were entering upon a task as great as the building of a cathedral, for unless we do so<lb facs="P20_TL00049"/>we shall only succeed in erecting one more wedding-cake affair. That we may not fall into<lb facs="P20_TL00050"/>this latter error let us take warning from the timidity of the Parisians who built an Opera<lb facs="P20_TL00051"/>House which is a blemish to a fair city, and if we are unconscious that it is an error let<lb facs="P20_TL00052"/>us visit Vienna, Munich, Berlin, Budapest, St Petersberg, and Moscow and see for ourselves<lb facs="P20_TL00053"/>what comes of compromise, conceit and insincerity.<lb facs="P20_TL00054"/>Intriguing and conceited Builders may have put those terrible State Opera Houses and<lb facs="P20_TL00055"/>Theatres in their place and may have put them there securely, but assuredly no Master<lb facs="P20_TL00056"/>Architect was there to control them ... and let us not forget that without a great architect at<lb facs="P20_TL00057"/>the head of affairs we, like those other cities, shall certainly make a muddle.<lb facs="P20_TL00058"/>Naturally no such building as I have in mind in writing this,... one worthy of comparison</ab>

In fact, when called before the<lb facs="P21_TL00013"/>committee to explain his design he was laughed at to such an extent, was so exasperated<lb facs="P21_TL00014"/>by delays and distrust of his powers that, in an access of fury, he had to be carried kicking<lb facs="P21_TL00015"/>from the room.

Why, Brunelleschi's design for the dome was considered so " queer "<lb facs="P21_TL00045"/>that the authorities locked him up in prison for making it, probably thinking such an<lb facs="P21_TL00046"/>idea could be born only in the brain of a madman, and he was rescued with considerable<lb facs="P21_TL00047"/>difficulty ; so let us in our turn beware of rejecting a thing as "queer" only because we have<lb facs="P21_TL00048"/>never seen its like before.-^</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P22_TL00005"/>when masters of Theatrical Art are rare we must learn as best we can. 'The<lb facs="P22_TL00006"/>Managers are too busy to help us and the Actors and Actresses have lost the knack of<lb facs="P22_TL00007"/>Instructing. Many a student, either too poor or too intelligent to go to one of the Schools<lb facs="P22_TL00008"/>of Dramatic Art, has to be his own master; and, with care and plenty of self criticism, he<lb facs="P22_TL00009"/>can have no more faithful tutor. &amp;&amp;? &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&lt;&amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00010"/>&amp; Yet there are masters willing to help the student of our Art and to do so for next to<lb facs="P22_TL00011"/>nothing; and, even if not strictly speaking dramatic tutors, these masters come very near<lb facs="P22_TL00012"/>the mark and in some respects are better than the professional teachers. I allude to the old<lb facs="P22_TL00013"/>masters of painting whose works we can study when and where we will. <lb facs="P22_TL00014"/>&amp; But no, not quite where we will, for most of the works of the old Italian, Dutch, and<lb facs="P22_TL00015"/>Spanish masters are to be seen only abroad, though we can go to the National Gallery in<lb facs="P22_TL00016"/>Trafalgar Square and study some of them if we will, and reproductions of the schools of Italy,<lb facs="P22_TL00017"/>Holland and Spain can be had at prices within the reach of all.<lb facs="P22_TL00018"/>&amp; And what, you ask, can w© learn from these masters ? 1 will tell you.<lb facs="P22_TL00019"/>You can derive many wonderful things and learn many useful things; though surely no<lb facs="P22_TL00020"/>one who looks at these works needs to be told what can be derived by studying them. As<lb facs="P22_TL00021"/>for learning from them, you can do so by studying in them movement, dramatic movement<lb facs="P22_TL00022"/>facial expression, the values of light and shadow, historical and fanciful costume, and some<lb facs="P22_TL00023"/>of the significance of a pictorial scene. &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00024"/>&amp; If you visit the National Gallery continually, and if you are able to be undisturbed while<lb facs="P22_TL00025"/>studying the wonderful collection which the Nation has to offer you, you will receive a<lb facs="P22_TL00026"/>fuller impression than if you study reproductions in black and white : but even these can<lb facs="P22_TL00027"/>be of very great value to you and I will tell you how to get them in a way easily within<lb facs="P22_TL00028"/>your reach. And consider what a great advantage it will be to have in your own room a set<lb facs="P22_TL00029"/>of pictures full of such things as i have enumerated, for you can study so much better in<lb facs="P22_TL00030"/>private, and a Public Gallery cannot offer you sufficient privacy for your work. &lt;£?<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>A publisher (i) has for some years been issuing small volumes literally packed with<lb facs="P22_TL00032"/>good reproductions of all the best works of the Masters of Italy, Holland, Spain and other<lb facs="P22_TL00033"/>countries. You can have the masterpieces of Giotto, Carpaccio, Durer, Tintoretto, Fra An=<lb facs="P22_TL00034"/>gelico, Veronese, Holbein, Velasquez, Teniers,.... the list is too long to complete it here,<lb facs="P22_TL00035"/>and you can get a volume containing sixty of these reproductions for sixpence. &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00036"/>And from every picture there is something to be derived or learned. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00037"/>That possibly never before occurred to you, but it may interest you to learn that it oc»<lb facs="P22_TL00038"/>curred to men and women in your calling whose names and work you hold in great esteem.<lb facs="P22_TL00039"/>Miss Ellen Terry, for example, owes much to the masters of painting; Forbes Robertson<lb facs="P22_TL00040"/>much ; Madame Bernhardt and Madame Duse and Salvini all have studied under them ;<lb facs="P22_TL00041"/>Henry Irving very often betook himself to them although, possibly owing to his early<lb facs="P22_TL00042"/>training, he was fond of selecting as guide the more flamboyant rather that the more restful<lb facs="P22_TL00043"/>masters: he preferred Rubens and Vandyke to Giotto and Masolino, yet, strange to say, his<lb facs="P22_TL00044"/>movements were the movements which Giotto teaches and not those of Rubens.<lb facs="P22_TL00045"/>You must not be put out by 44 advisers " who tell you that you have nothing to learn<lb facs="P22_TL00046"/>from Giotto, for example. You may be quite a different person from the 44 adviser ... that<lb facs="P22_TL00047"/>individual who has so little to do that he advises everyone else to do as little... and you<lb facs="P22_TL00048"/>will do well not to trouble about people who tell you that movement is not to be learned<lb facs="P22_TL00049"/>from studying movement in pictures. It is so to be learned, and In schools of the Dance the<lb facs="P22_TL00050"/>pupils,... nay, even the masters,... give much time to the study of the movement in designs<lb facs="P22_TL00051"/>upon Greek vases, In sculpture and in early painting. <lb facs="P22_TL00052"/>&amp; But be careful to select for your study none but the best masters. The best masters of<lb facs="P22_TL00053"/>Dramatic movement are Giotto, Masolino, Michel Angelo and Rembrandt, though the two<lb facs="P22_TL00054"/>first are finer than the two last,... finer because more restful, having brought movement<lb facs="P22_TL00055"/>down to a state of repose. The other two may be said to 44work it up" more, although at<lb facs="P22_TL00056"/>times Rembrandt is very restrained, while he can be the most poignant of all. &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P23_TL00003"/>For facial expression also these four will still serve you as very noble tutors, though<lb facs="P23_TL00004"/>Fra Angelico, Franz Hals, Teniers and Hogarth enter more into this subject, and Giotto<lb facs="P23_TL00005"/>even here is the finest master of all, but very, very difficult to understand. You must not<lb facs="P23_TL00006"/>think, however, that facial expression is "making faces." You probably do not think so, but<lb facs="P23_TL00007"/>do not forget it. &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00008"/>For costume and scene, including light and shadow, all the masters are very valuable and<lb facs="P23_TL00009"/>though I still put Giotto first you will do well to study Fra Angelico a great deal. Michael<lb facs="P23_TL00010"/>Angelo is of little use to you here. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00011"/>Beware of the " superb " masters.

                                    <lb facs="P23_TL00016"/>nese and Tintoretto. He would do better to learn from Carpaccio who, in movement, costume<lb facs="P23_TL00017"/>and scene is quiet without being austere like many Italians, yet who avoids being over-rich<lb facs="P23_TL00018"/>and noisy like Veronese.<lb facs="P23_TL00019"/>You are not to think I am finding fault with a master; I only wish to point to one who<lb facs="P23_TL00020"/>I consider better fitted to instruct you. Carpaccio is the golden mean between the very calm<lb facs="P23_TL00021"/>church painters and the very swagger city painters,.... the balance between the sacred<lb facs="P23_TL00022"/>and profane.<lb facs="P23_TL00023"/>For nearly all the Shakespearean plays of which the scenes are laid in Italy Carpaccio<lb facs="P23_TL00024"/>is an admirable master. He lived between 1478 and 1522. His scenes and costumes are<lb facs="P23_TL00025"/>mostly Venetian,... and these of course will not do for "Romeo and Juliet" if you wish to be<lb facs="P23_TL00026"/>correct in detail. But do you wish to be correct in detail or correct in spirit? If the latter,<lb facs="P23_TL00027"/>then study Carpaccio without fear. &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00028"/>I have forgotten to mention the two Bellinis for our publisher has not as yet favoured<lb facs="P23_TL00029"/>us with a book of their pictures; possibly he may do so before long.<lb facs="P23_TL00030"/>He has issued very many volumes of interest besides these that I have mentioned, amongst<lb facs="P23_TL00031"/>them being four volumes of the Drawings of Old Masters, (each sixpence) and a little work<lb facs="P23_TL00032"/>on Fossil Plants which will be very useful to you as a help in studying patterns. Then there<lb facs="P23_TL00033"/>are a couple of volumes of " The Masterpieces of Sculpture ". &amp; £?<lb facs="P23_TL00034"/>&amp; Dancers and Actors have often availed themselves of the sculpture of the masters, but<lb facs="P23_TL00035"/>except in one or two instances have benefitted very little. There is something too cold, too<lb facs="P23_TL00036"/>perfect, about sculpture to serve the actor, and the only pieces of sculpture which I should<lb facs="P23_TL00037"/>advise you to trouble about are the bas-reliefs. The " all-round " sculpture curiously enough<lb facs="P23_TL00038"/>baulks more often than It assists. &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00039"/>I have not gone much into detail In this short article but if you wish I will do so another *<lb facs="P23_TL00040"/>time, for there is plenty to be said on the subject and I shall be glad to return to it.<lb facs="P23_TL00041"/>Meantime I may as well tell you which masters you need not trouble to study at all; they<lb facs="P23_TL00042"/>are Reynolds, Murillo, Raeburn, Del Sarto, Correggio, Poussin, Gainsborough, Luini and<lb facs="P23_TL00043"/>Greuze.<lb facs="P23_TL00044"/>By the way, you ought to write to the publisher whose address I have given you and<lb facs="P23_TL00045"/>ask him when he will publish a volume of Leonardo's pictures and some volumes of Leo<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Artistically it<lb facs="P24_TL00036"/>is most profane, yet in spite of this the old story is as triumphant as ever, and creates in<lb facs="P24_TL00037"/>some of us a profound impression.

The sequence of events as related in the drama begins in the spring of 1521 with<lb facs="P27_TL00020"/>the arrest of the Duke of Buckingham, and ends with the birth of Elizabeth, which took<lb facs="P27_TL00021"/>place in the autumn of IS33, the year before that important one in the history of England<lb facs="P27_TL00022"/>when the exercise of the power of the Papal Court in this land was formally declared by<lb facs="P27_TL00023"/>Act of Parliament to be illegal. To show how far Shakspere has followed the real history<lb facs="P27_TL00024"/>of these twelve years, I give here a brief record of the time, as I have done in my notes<lb facs="P27_TL00025"/>on the other historical plays :—<lb facs="P27_TL00026"/>1521. The Duke of Buckingham arrested. Tried by the Peers May, 13, and<lb facs="P27_TL00027"/>executed May 17.<lb facs="P27_TL00028"/>Buckingham was charged with having entertained designs on the<lb facs="P27_TL00029"/>Crown as early as 1511, with having had his horoscope cast by the<lb facs="P27_TL00030"/>Zadkiel of the period, one Nicholas Hopkins, a Carthusian monk, and<lb facs="P27_TL00031"/>with plotting the death of the King, Wolsey, and others.<lb facs="P27_TL00032"/>1528. Oct. 7. Cardinal Campegius arrives in England from Rome with a commission<lb facs="P27_TL00033"/>to try, conjointly with Cardinal Wolsey, the question of the King's<lb facs="P27_TL00034"/>marriage with his brother's widow, Katherlne. The two Cardinals<lb facs="P27_TL00035"/>wait on the Queen.<lb facs="P27_TL00036"/>1529. May 7. The Cardinals open their commission at the Monastery of Back Friars.<lb facs="P27_TL00037"/>Witnesses, including the King and Queen, are summoned, and the<lb facs="P27_TL00038"/>real business commences June 18, on which day the Queen enters a<lb facs="P27_TL00039"/>protest against the Cardinals as judges. She appears before the Court<lb facs="P27_TL00040"/>again June 21, and this time in the presence of the King, but will<lb facs="P27_TL00041"/>not admit the legality of the tribunal, leaves the Court, and is held<lb facs="P27_TL00042"/>contumacious. On July 30 the Cardinals adjourn to October 1, secretly<lb facs="P27_TL00043"/>aware that the Pope had, on July, 18, allowed the cause to be tried<lb facs="P27_TL00044"/>at Rome.<lb facs="P27_TL00045"/>1529. Aug. The King takes his autumn tour with the light graceful-mannered<lb facs="P27_TL00046"/>Anne Boleyn; receives the legates at Grafton, dismisses them, and<lb facs="P27_TL00047"/>never sees Wolsey again.<lb facs="P27_TL00048"/>1529. Oct. 9. Cardinal Wolsey takes his seat in the Lord Chancellor's Court, and<lb facs="P27_TL00049"/>the Attorney-General indicts him in the Court of King's Bench for<lb facs="P27_TL00050"/>acting contrary to the Statute of Provisors (25th Edward III.).<lb facs="P27_TL00051"/>1529. Oct. 17. The Great Seal taken from Wolsey and given to Sir Thomas More.<lb facs="P27_TL00052"/>1529. Oct. 28. The judgment of the Court of King's Bench is pronounced, and the<lb facs="P27_TL00053"/>Cardinal receives sentence of imprisonment and forfeiture of goods.<lb facs="P27_TL00054"/>1530. Feb. 12.

May 16. Sir Thomas More resigns the office of Lord Chancellor.<lb facs="P28_TL00009"/>*533* Feh. 21. Cranmer appointed Archbishop of Canterbury.<lb facs="P28_TL00010"/>1533- May 23=28. Cranmer, at his court held at Dunstable, decrees the marriage of the<lb facs="P28_TL00011"/>King to his brother's widow to have been invalid, and his union with<lb facs="P28_TL00012"/>Anne Boleyn lawful. A few days after, Katherine—who was still<lb facs="P28_TL00013"/>" contumacious " enough to dispute Cranmer's right to judge, and<lb facs="P28_TL00014"/>too old-fashioned and obstinate to see the beauty of separation by<lb facs="P28_TL00015"/>mutual consent—was removed (some say by force) from Ampthill to<lb facs="P28_TL00016"/>Kimbolton, where she died, January 7, 1536.<lb facs="P28_TL00017"/>1533* Sept. 7. Anne Boleyn gives birth to the "princess" Elizabeth at the royal<lb facs="P28_TL00018"/>manor or palaco, Greenwich.<lb facs="P28_TL00019"/>&amp; The clamour against Wolsey for illegal exactions and unjust taxation did not arise until<lb facs="P28_TL00020"/>some years after Buckingham's death, and to restore himself to the King's favour Wolsey<lb facs="P28_TL00021"/>presented his sovereign with his newly-built palace of Hampton Court. With this exception,<lb facs="P28_TL00022"/>the first Act is a thoroughly consistent historical picture of the early days of the month<lb facs="P28_TL00023"/>of May 1521. &amp;&amp;&amp;&gt;&amp;£/&amp;?<lb facs="P28_TL00024"/>The second Act begins in the afternoon of the day of the trial " of the great Duke of<lb facs="P28_TL00025"/>Buckingham," May 13, 1321, but before the first scene closes we hear the news that u Car<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

In the third scene, "Anne Bullen" is created Marchioness of Pembroke,<lb facs="P28_TL00029"/>an event which really happened in September 1552, and then we go back to 1529 for the<lb facs="P28_TL00030"/>next scene—The trial of Queen Katherine. Act III. begins by reversing history, and making<lb facs="P28_TL00031"/>the visit of the Cardinals to Katherine to follow instead of to precede the trial, and the<lb facs="P28_TL00032"/>rest of the Act is devoted to an entirely mythical account of the fall of Wolsey, made at<lb facs="P28_TL00033"/>the end worse than mythical by Cromwell's very premature announcements concerning<lb facs="P28_TL00034"/>Cranmer and the Lady Anne. The fourth Act begins and ends in June 1533, but Griffith's<lb facs="P28_TL00035"/>news about Wolsey's death is just as tardy as Cromwell's news in the last Act was prema<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The fifth Act occupies three days in September 1533, but the Lord Chancellor, Sir<lb facs="P28_TL00037"/>Thomas More, had resigned long before Cranmer had been made Archbishop, and the insults<lb facs="P28_TL00038"/>offered by Gardiner and others to the latter at the Council board did not occur till some<lb facs="P28_TL00039"/>time after the birth of Elizabeth.<lb facs="P28_TL00040"/>The scenery throughout the play is architectural, and is laid in London and Westminster,<lb facs="P28_TL00041"/>with the ecxeption of an interior in Kimbolton Castle (Act iv. Sc. 2), and the last act, which<lb facs="P28_TL00042"/>takes place at Greenwich. If, further, we deduct the fourth scene of the second Act and<lb facs="P28_TL00043"/>the two streets in Westminster, we shall find nothing else but palaces to deal with; so that<lb facs="P28_TL00044"/>we may arrange our list of scenery as follows:—<lb facs="P28_TL00045"/>Streets. Two in Westminster. (Act ii. Sc. 1; Act iv. Sc. 1.)<lb facs="P28_TL00046"/>Castle. Kimbolton. (Act iv. Sc. 2.)<lb facs="P28_TL00047"/>Monastery. Blackfriars, London. (Act ii. Sc. 4.)<lb facs="P28_TL00048"/>Palaces. Westminster. (Act i. Sc. 1, 2, 3 , Act ii. Sc. 2, 3.)<lb facs="P28_TL00049"/>Bridewell. (Act Hi.)<lb facs="P28_TL00050"/>/<lb facs="P28_TL00051"/>Greenwich.

Such a scene, managed with a little care, cannot fail to be highly<lb facs="P29_TL00008"/>effective. We see the old timber houses of Lancastrian and Plantagenet reigns crowding<lb facs="P29_TL00009"/>their gabies one against another. We see the water-gate, the beginning of the steps, and<lb facs="P29_TL00010"/>the bargemen waiting for their orders; there, too, is the rabble many who in all times<lb facs="P29_TL00011"/>have liked to look on the interesting spectacle of a man burdened with a huge weight of<lb facs="P29_TL00012"/>trouble; there are the tipstaves, the halberdiers, and the officers; there are merchants*<lb facs="P29_TL00013"/>gentlemen, and some foreigners, too, who have come up from the city to see the trial of<lb facs="P29_TL00014"/>the " bounteous Buckingham, the mirror of all courtesy," and who, like gentlemen, "stand<lb facs="P29_TL00015"/>close "—that is, retired and as privately as may be, that the condemned may not see them.<lb facs="P29_TL00016"/>Over all, while the sparrows are twittering on the roof, and the pigeons cooing on the<lb facs="P29_TL00017"/>penthouse, the afternoon sun of a bright May day throws long shadows on the ground, and<lb facs="P29_TL00018"/>makes, by contrast, a very horror of the sorrow. It is a month later and twelve years after<lb facs="P29_TL00019"/>this sad scene that we find ourselves again in a street at Westminster. Two of our old<lb facs="P29_TL00020"/>friends, who stood close in private talk to see the last of Buckingham, are here to see the<lb facs="P29_TL00021"/>first of the new Queen as she comes in state from her coronation to the palace of Whitehall<lb facs="P29_TL00022"/>or York Place. It is a broiling sunny day in June, both sides of the street are in sunlight,<lb facs="P29_TL00023"/>but there are deep shadows under the many projections of the overhanging storeys, and<lb facs="P29_TL00024"/>strong shade on all the jutting angles. At the far end of the street rises cool and grey the<lb facs="P29_TL00025"/>north transept of the Abbey, with the wear and tear of three centuries upon it, but other<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

By no means built in<lb facs="P29_TL00027"/>a straight line is it, this street which leads from the Abbey to Whitehall; there are also<lb facs="P29_TL00028"/>cross=lanes or streets, and the narrow thoroughfare widens out as it reaches the boundary<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The old<lb facs="P29_TL00035"/>materials of the fortification were used in constructing the Priory, and a new city wall<lb facs="P29_TL00036"/>was ordered to be erected on a line going westward from Ludgate behind the houses to<lb facs="P29_TL00037"/>the river Fleet, and then southward to the Thames. A new tower for the King's reception<lb facs="P29_TL00038"/>was also ordered to be built at the head of the wall, "within the water of the Thames<lb facs="P29_TL00039"/>there wherein the King might be received and tarry with honour to his ease and satisfaction<lb facs="P29_TL00040"/>in his comings there. " The style of architecture for this great scene might very justly be<lb facs="P29_TL00041"/>that which prevailed in the time of Edward I.—in other words the style of the North Walk<lb facs="P29_TL00042"/>of the Cloisters at Westminster. The interior, up to a certain height, would be covered up<lb facs="P29_TL00043"/>by the fittings of the Court, which were prepared with all deliberation, and to produce an<lb facs="P29_TL00044"/>imposing and solemn dramatic effect. Indeed all the externals of the reign of Henry VIII.<lb facs="P29_TL00045"/>—the ceremonies of state, the masques, the feasts, the public business, the public pleasures<lb facs="P29_TL00046"/>and amusements—seem to have been disignedly conducted in a dramatic, and sometimes<lb facs="P29_TL00047"/>even a stagey, manner. The arrangement of the royal throne under its " cloth of state " or<lb facs="P29_TL00048"/>dais, of the judges' bench below it, and of the peers' seats each side, of the tables, the<lb facs="P29_TL00049"/>position of the clerks, &amp;c., are all well indicated or suggested by the stage directions in<lb facs="P29_TL00050"/>the play. The general plan would be much the same as that we see in the arrangement of<lb facs="P29_TL00051"/>the present House of Lords. But as the fittings were all set up for the occasion, they were<lb facs="P29_TL00052"/>necessarily in great part of a temporary character, concealed by hangings, dossels, cushions,<lb facs="P29_TL00053"/>and covers of sundry kinds. Below the cardinals sat the officers of the court (the chief clerk<lb facs="P29_TL00054"/>and the apparitor), and on the other side of the table, facing the officers, the Cardinals,<lb facs="P29_TL00055"/>and the King, sat the Archbishop and Bishops; on one side of the table was ranged the<lb facs="P29_TL00056"/>strong array of the counsel for the King, and on the opposite side the five counsel for the<lb facs="P29_TL00057"/>Queen, who sat near them, but at some distance from the throne.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P30_TL00003"/>Of the four royal palaces of Westminister, Whitehall, Bridewell, and Greenwich, nothing<lb facs="P30_TL00004"/>is left to us except the great hall of that at Westminster. Bridewell was an old fortified<lb facs="P30_TL00005"/>place, and was rebuilt by Henry VIII. for the reception of the Emperor's retinue on the<lb facs="P30_TL00006"/>occasion of his visit in 1522. Whitehall, or York Place, was built by Hubert de Burgh, Earl<lb facs="P30_TL00007"/>of Kent. It was afterwards bought by Walter de Gray, Archbishop of York, 12x6-1255. On<lb facs="P30_TL00008"/>the fall of the Cardinal of S. Cecilia it came into the possession of the Crown, and was the<lb facs="P30_TL00009"/>chief residence of the Court from 1530 to 2697, when the old buildings were destroyed by<lb facs="P30_TL00010"/>a fire. York House was in great part rebuilt by the Cardinal, whose lavish expenditure, on<lb facs="P30_TL00011"/>a very doubful kind of art, was only exceeded by the King, of whom it is recordod that he<lb facs="P30_TL00012"/>expended on his now walnut-tree bedstead for Whitehall no less than 86/. 3s. 10d. (old value)<lb facs="P30_TL00013"/>irrespective of the fees due to one Master William, who devised the work and instructed<lb facs="P30_TL00014"/>the workmen.

Pugin, are a large number of engravings from measured drawings of<lb facs="P30_TL00025"/>Thornbury, and in Parker's 44 Domestic Architecture of the Middle Ages," the 44 Boke of<lb facs="P30_TL00026"/>the Surveye " Is largely quoted. Wolsey's work at Hampton Court was finished in 1526. The<lb facs="P30_TL00027"/>date of the chapel and dinlng-chamber would appear to be later, as we find in these rooms<lb facs="P30_TL00028"/>Henry's initial, bound by a love-knot, to that of Jane Seymour, who became his queen in<lb facs="P30_TL00029"/>1536 and died in 1537.

A printed criticism for instance found<lb facs="P35_TL00017"/>but one dramatic moment, that when Deirdre in the second act overhears her lover say that<lb facs="P35_TL00018"/>he may grow weary of her; and not one, if I remember rightly, chose for praise or explanation<lb facs="P35_TL00019"/>the third act which alone had satisfied the author, or contained in any abundance those<lb facs="P35_TL00020"/>sentences that were quoted at the fall of the curtain and for days after. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P35_TL00021"/>&amp; Deirdre and her lover, as Synge tells the tale, returned to Ireland though it was<lb facs="P35_TL00022"/>nearly certain they would die there, because death was better than broken love, and at<lb facs="P35_TL00023"/>the side of the open grave that had been dug for one and would serve for both, quarreled,<lb facs="P35_TL00024"/>losing all they had given their life to keep. 44 Is it not a hard thing that we should miss<lb facs="P35_TL00025"/>the safety of the grave and we trampling its edge?" That is Deirdre's cry at the outset of<lb facs="P35_TL00026"/>a reverie of passion that mounts and mounts till grief itself has carried her beyond grief<lb facs="P35_TL00027"/>into pure contemplation. Up to this the play had been a Master's unfinished work, mono®<lb facs="P35_TL00028"/>tonous and melancholy, ill arranged, little more than a sketch of what it would have grown<lb facs="P35_TL00029"/>to, but now I listened breathless to sentences that may never pass away, and as they<lb facs="P35_TL00030"/>filled or dwindled in their civility of sorrow, the player, whose art had seemed<lb facs="P35_TL00031"/>clumsy and incomplete, like the writing itself, ascended into that tragic ecstacy which<lb facs="P35_TL00032"/>is the best that art perhaps that life can give. At last when Deirdre, in the<lb facs="P35_TL00033"/>paroxysm before she took her life, touched with compassionate fingers him that had killed<lb facs="P35_TL00034"/>her lover, we knew that the player had become, if but for a moment, the creature of<lb facs="P35_TL00035"/>that noble mind which had gathered its art in waste islands, and we too were carried<lb facs="P35_TL00036"/>beyond time and persons to where passion living through its thousand purgatorial years,</ab>

In poetical drama there is, it is held, an antithesis<lb facs="P35_TL00044"/>between character and lyric poetry, for lyric poetry however beautiful when read out of a<lb facs="P35_TL00045"/>book can but, as these critics think, encumber the action. Yet when we go back a few<lb facs="P35_TL00046"/>centuries and enter the great periods of drama, character grows less and sometimes disap®<lb facs="P35_TL00047"/>pears, and there is much lyric feeling, and at times a lyric measure will be wrought<lb facs="P35_TL00048"/>into the dialogue, a flowing measure that had well befitted music, or that laboured one of the<lb facs="P35_TL00049"/>sonnet. Suddenly it strikes us that character is continuously present in comedy alone, and that<lb facs="P35_TL00050"/>there is much tragedy, that of Corneille, that of Racine, that of Greece and Rome, where<lb facs="P35_TL00051"/>its place is taken by passions and motives, one person being jealous, another full *of love<lb facs="P35_TL00052"/>or remorse or pride or anger. In writers of tragicomedy (and Shakespeare is always a<lb facs="P35_TL00053"/>writer of tragi® comedy) there is indeed character, but one notices that it is in the mo=<lb facs="P35_TL00054"/>ments of comedy that character is defined, in Hamlet's gaiety let us say; but that in the<lb facs="P35_TL00055"/>great moments, when Timon orders his tomb, when Hamlet cries to Horatio 44 absent thee<lb facs="P35_TL00056"/>from felicity awhile ", when Cleopatra names 44 Of many thousand kisses the poor last''<lb facs="P35_TL00057"/>all Is lyricism, unmixed passion, 4 the integrity of fire Nor does character ever attain to<lb facs="P35_TL00058"/>complete definition in these lamps ready for the taper, no matter how circumstantial and</ab>

Today any one can pass on to the stage.<lb facs="P40_TL00030"/>Talent and taste are not the first requirements, intelligence and study not of much account.<lb facs="P40_TL00031"/>Such a pity, this I What barrier is there to prevent noodles, (female as well as male), from<lb facs="P40_TL00032"/>going on to the boards? None. What is there to prevent every young energetic man without<lb facs="P40_TL00033"/>the necessary talent or training from bouncing the stage and its crew ? Nothing. Of course<lb facs="P40_TL00034"/>energy is valuable,... Mr Seymour Hicks has energy... and it sets a good example ; but<lb facs="P40_TL00035"/>what the stage wants is energy behind talent, behind taste, and behind genius if it is lucky<lb facs="P40_TL00036"/>in claiming a genius.<lb facs="P40_TL00037"/>&amp; In England we are, or should one say were, prejudiced against the word Art. We think<lb facs="P40_TL00038"/>like yokels about the artist; we ask him what he does for a living, and if he never does<lb facs="P40_TL00039"/>any work. We forget that Art is as much a labour as anything else and for a man to excel<lb facs="P40_TL00040"/>in this calling he must have laboured exceedingly hard.... quite as hard as a carpenter<lb facs="P40_TL00041"/>at his bench.<lb facs="P40_TL00042"/>The artist has a natural (If somewhat affected) aristocratic dislike for the sounds and<lb facs="P40_TL00043"/>smells and sights of mere labour as labour.

But he fails to show us clearly any such striking<lb facs="P41_TL00009"/>development as those lands have to show us, so, I repeat, 1 wonder if London likes that<lb facs="P41_TL00010"/>sort of thing. &amp; It is the cheap theatre he has to offer<lb facs="P41_TL00011"/>&amp; His lecture-essay is very full of words many of which are not at all clear to me. <lb facs="P41_TL00012"/>&amp; Nowhere except when speaking of the Speaker of the House of Commons or of men of<lb facs="P41_TL00013"/>quality does he give offence. He is as careful to avoid treading on the corns of the crowd<lb facs="P41_TL00014"/>as though he feared retaliation of some sort. &amp;<lb facs="P41_TL00015"/>With a shopkeeper's twang he talks of his " trade " and proceeds to show how bad an<lb facs="P41_TL00016"/>accountant he would make, asserting that " a few thousands a year ", and later on " five<lb facs="P41_TL00017"/>thousand pounds ", is enough to spend on a Free National Theatre,.... not merely a Na<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P41_TL00018"/>tional Theatre but one free like the National Gallery. As twenty five thousand pounds<lb facs="P41_TL00019"/>would be too little it is strange that Mr Barker, who claims to know about the Theatre,<lb facs="P41_TL00020"/>does not know this. &amp;<lb facs="P41_TL00021"/>&amp; But then as I have said before he Is thinking of a cheap theatre.<lb facs="P41_TL00022"/>&amp; Where Mr Barker speaks well is where he echoes Mr Bernard Shaw. Thus his passage<lb facs="P41_TL00023"/>about Puritan Art and Repertory Theatres not paying is good because the ideas come from<lb facs="P41_TL00024"/>Shaw. Mr Barker does not acknowledge this. A passage surely quite original, (though of<lb facs="P41_TL00025"/>this I am not certain), is the following: "A play is anything that can be made effective<lb facs="P41_TL00026"/>upon the stage of a theatre by human agency " .... A very cheap proposition.<lb facs="P41_TL00027"/>One is left dazzled by this class of originalitj'. One is not used to it on the Continent<lb facs="P41_TL00028"/>and one is left wondering how Albion likes it, and what punishment she is contempla<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P41_TL00029"/>ting for these who poke such fun at her. It certainly is not Normal,.... I like it the<lb facs="P41_TL00030"/>better for that, but what is it? What is Mr Barker anyhow? I sit wondering. Some one should<lb facs="P41_TL00031"/>advise him to trot around a bit and pick up a few ideas abroad. He need not go further<lb facs="P41_TL00032"/>than Boulogne to be thoroughly startled.<lb facs="P41_TL00033"/>&amp; " And what do you make of it? " I asked a shrewd American after he had read Mr<lb facs="P41_TL00034"/>Barker's article;" Don't yoii think the man who wrote that would be the safe head of a<lb facs="P41_TL00035"/>theatre? " <lb facs="P41_TL00036"/>&amp; He answered, " Sir, it strikes me as written by a man that's dead and doesn't know it;<lb facs="P41_TL00037"/>and if your theatres aint mighty strong they'll die of association with such timidity and<lb facs="P41_TL00038"/>conventionality." &amp; &lt;£? &amp; JSP &amp; &amp; &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P42_TL00006"/>(not to say everyone), had always thought of Miss Horniman as being evidently a<lb facs="P42_TL00007"/>very kindly lady charitably giving her money to forward the plans of capable artists.<lb facs="P42_TL00008"/>Even as Whistler always dreamed of Romeike and Curtice the press agents as being the<lb facs="P42_TL00009"/>name of some charming myth, so has one been used to thinking of Miss Horniman.<lb facs="P42_TL00010"/>&amp; One imagined a graceful young woman of about twenty eight years of age, moved to<lb facs="P42_TL00011"/>gracious deeds and words through a knowledge beyond her years, saying little and doing<lb facs="P42_TL00012"/>much ; almost an ideal of womanhood ; a fairy, touching the little Irish group of artists<lb facs="P42_TL00013"/>with her golden wand and making many of their dreams possible; passing on to Manchester<lb facs="P42_TL00014"/>to enact a like miracle,... doing it all for love of the deed. Sweetness seemed hers.<lb facs="P42_TL00015"/>It was a dream. The illusion is shattered once and for ever, and it is a great pity.<lb facs="P42_TL00016"/>Miss Horniman has spoken to the representative of the Referee and her wings have drop*<lb facs="P42_TL00017"/>ped away; the sweetness on which she leaned has given place to a stick,... "the big stick"<lb facs="P42_TL00018"/>of another fable, (we hope only a fable,.... a monstrous fable of caves and dragons)....<lb facs="P42_TL00019"/>and she stands revealed before us in her true colours, white, purpie and green,.... the<lb facs="P42_TL00020"/>colours of the suffragettes.<lb facs="P42_TL00021"/>&amp; And, Jupiter, how she speaks! Alone I did it, she cries; I,... 1, Miss Horniman, founded<lb facs="P42_TL00022"/>the National Irish Theatre; and mark me, there is no man behind me, The Irish are a<lb facs="P42_TL00023"/>set of ungrateful wretches and I'm going to give 'em a lesson by asking a thousand pounds<lb facs="P42_TL00024"/>rent for my little theatre of their's. Once I gave it them rent free... but not now;... no,<lb facs="P42_TL00025"/>no ! Shall I tell you why I won't give it them free ? Because 1 want to prove conclusively<lb facs="P42_TL00026"/>that there's no man behind me, I am fifty years old,... you dare to contradict me! and<lb facs="P42_TL00027"/>at fifty a young girl's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of art. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P42_TL00028"/>This is the gist, if not the exact words, of Miss Horniman's statement. But this is not<lb facs="P42_TL00029"/>all. She can't let the wonderful little group in Ireland alone. She tells Lady Gregory flat<lb facs="P42_TL00030"/>that the Irish dislike everything that's English. This is all the more curious because only<lb facs="P42_TL00031"/>just lately the Irish Theatre has welcomed and accepted an Englishman's work, and any one<lb facs="P42_TL00032"/>who could appreciate what Yeats and his followers have done for the Art of the Theatre<lb facs="P42_TL00033"/>would be sure of a welcome by the Irish people; but to expect an enthusiastic greeting from<lb facs="P42_TL00034"/>a nation after having admitted antipathy to it, as Miss Horniman has done, is expecting<lb facs="P42_TL00035"/>too much. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; *&amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P42_TL00036"/>Yet it is only natural that Suffragettes should be over=sanguine. They are making a<lb facs="P42_TL00037"/>splendid fight of it, losing to win, and those who lose most are the noisy ones who, like<lb facs="P42_TL00038"/>Miss Horniman, prefer to be ungracious rather than gracious.<lb facs="P42_TL00039"/>&amp; "Would you be gracious," they cry, "in the face of such oppression and insult?"

It is a pity their best<lb facs="P44_TL00032"/>is so bad.

These are<lb facs="P44_TL00051"/>the two faults he finds: "First, the<lb facs="P44_TL00052"/>" insistence upon vertical lines in the tall<lb facs="P44_TL00053"/>u gigantic pillars tends to dwarf the stature<lb facs="P44_TL00054"/>" of the actors; and second, the rectilinear<lb facs="P44_TL00055"/>" design does not admit a convergence of<lb facs="P44_TL00056"/>" lines upon any point of the stage which<lb facs="P44_TL00057"/>" will cast into relief the action which is<lb facs="P44_TL00058"/>" carried on within it. "<lb facs="P44_TL00059"/>But Mr Hamilton must know that these<lb facs="P44_TL00060"/>difficulties have been surmounted in Europe<lb facs="P44_TL00061"/>for some time.

The second scene reproduced is that of<lb facs="P44_TL00064"/>a very conventional stage college garden.

                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00005"/>Jt is the observation of an elegant writer that disquisitions concerning the manners and<lb facs="P5_TL00006"/>conduct of our species in early times, or indeed at any time, are always curious at least<lb facs="P5_TL00007"/>and amusing. An investigation of the subject before us, if completely and successfully<lb facs="P5_TL00008"/>performed, would serve to fill up a chasm in the history of our popular antiquities; but<lb facs="P5_TL00009"/>this must not be expected. The culpable indifference of historical writers to private man<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00010"/>ners, and more especially to the recreations and amusements of the common people, has<lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>occasioned the difficulties that always attend enquiries of this nature, many of which are<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>involved in impenetrable darkness; whilst others can only receive illustration from detached<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>and scattered facts accompanied by judicious inferences and opinions. &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>&amp; It will be necessary in the first place, to attempt some definition of what the morris<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>dance originally was: this may be best accomplished by the aid of etymology, which will generally<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>be found a faithful guide, when managed with discretion. It seems, however, on the present<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>occasion, to have been too slightly treated in a work of considerable labour and ingenuity,<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>the author of which has expressed an opinion that the Morris dance originated from that<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>part of the ancient ceremony of the feast of fools, in which certain persons habited like<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>buffoons, with bells etc, joined in a dance. He then proceeds as follows, " The word Morris<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>applied to the dance is usually derived from Morisco, which in the Spanish language signifies<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>a Moor, as if the dance had been taken from the Moors; but I cannot help considering<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>this as a mistake, for it appears to me that the Morisce or Moor dance is exceedingly dif<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>ferent from the morris-dance formerly practised in this country; it being performed with<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>the castanets or rattles, at the ends of the fingers, and not with bells attached to various<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>parts of the dress, (i) I shall not pretend to investigate the derivation of the word Morris,<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>though probably it might be found at home; it seems, however, to have been applied to<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>the dance in modern times, and, I trust, long after the festival to which it originally belonged<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>was done away and had nearly sunk into oblivion." (2) &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>Now if the term in question had been exclusively used in England, there would have<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>been some weight in these observations; but when we find it adopted by most of the<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>European nations to express a dance, the origin of which both English and foreign glos<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>saries uniformly ascribe to the Moors, we must pause at least before we consent to abandon<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>the only clue that presents itself to assist us. &amp; &lt;&amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>The genuine Moorish or Morisco dance was, no doubt, very different from the English<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>morris; but there is scarcely an instance in which a fashion or amusement that has been<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>borrowed from a distant region has not in its progress through other countries undergone<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>such alterations as have much obscured its origin. This remark may be exemplified in chess<lb facs="P5_TL00039"/>and cards, which, beyond all doubt, were invented in India or China, and spread, by means</ab>

But the above writer has cited a passage from the play of Variety, 1949, in which<lb facs="P6_TL00007"/>the Spanish Morrisco is mentioned; and this not only shows the legitimacy of the term<lb facs="P6_TL00008"/>morris, but that the real and uncorrupted Moorish dance was to be found in Spain, where<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>it still continues to delight both natives and strangers under the name of the fandango.<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>It may be likewise remarked, that the exquisitely pretty music to this lively dance is<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>undoubtedly Moorish. (1) The Spanish morris was also danced at puppet-shows by a person<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>habited like a Moor, with castagnets; and Junius (Du Jon) has informed us that the morris<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>dancers usually blackened their faces with soot, that they might the better pass for Moors. (2)<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>&amp; Some have sought the origin of the morris in the Pyrrhica saltatio of the ancients, a<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>military dance which seems to have been invented by the Greeks, and was afterwards adopted<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>by the Salii or priests of Mars. This continued to be practised for many ages, till it became<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>corrupted by figures and gesticulations foreign to its original purpose. Such a dance was<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>well known in France and Italy by the name of the dance of fools or Matachins, who were<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>habited in short jackets with gilt=paper helmets, long streamers tied to their shoulders,<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>and bells to their legs. They carried in their hands a sword and buckler, with which they<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>made a clashing noise, and performed various quick and sprightly evolutions. (3) &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>&amp; A species of this sword dance by some means or other got introduced into England,<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>where it has generally and unaccountably been exhibited by women, whose dexterous feats<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>of tumbling and dancing with swords at fairs, and in the minor theatres, are still remem<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Such a one may be alluded to in "The second<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>part of King Henry the Sixth," Act iii. Sc. I<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>" I have seen him<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>Caper upright like a wild Morisco,<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>Shaking the bloody darts, as he his bells. "<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>Before we proceed to an examination of the more immediate object of this essay, the<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>English morris, it may be as well to lay before the reader a short description of the<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>uncorrupted morris dance, as practised in France about the middle of the sixteenth</ab>

(1) &amp; jg? &amp;<lb facs="P7_TL00004"/>He relates that in his youthful days it was the custom in good societies for a boy to<lb facs="P7_TL00005"/>come into the hall when supper was finished, with his face blackened, his forehead bound<lb facs="P7_TL00006"/>with white or yellow taffeta, and bells tied to his legs. He then proceeded to dance the Morisco<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>the whole length of the hall, backwards and forwards, to the great amusement of the<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>company. (2) He hints that the bell might have been borrowed from the crotali of the<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>ancients in the Pyrrhic dance. He then describes the more modern morris dance, which<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>was performed by striking the ground with the forepart of the feet; but, as this was found<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>to be too fatiguing, the motion was afterwards confined to the heel, the toes being kept<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>firm, by which means the dancer contrived to rattle his bells with more effect. He adds that<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>this mode of dancing fell into disuse, as it was found to bring on gouty complaints. This<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>is the air to which the last-mentioned morris was performed.</ab>

The May games of Robin Hood appear to have been principally instituted<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>for the encouragement of archery, and were generally accompanied by morris dancers, who,<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>nevertheless, formed but a subordinate part of the ceremony. It is by no means clear that<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>at any time Robin Hood and his companions were constituent characters in the morris.<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>There were, besides, May-games of a more simple nature, being merely dances round a<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>May-pole, by the lads and lasses of the village, and the undoubted remains of the Roman<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>Floralia.

This is a copy from an exceedingly scarce engraving<lb facs="P9_TL00044"/>on copper by Israel Von Mecheln, or Meckemen, so named from the place of his nativity,<lb facs="P9_TL00045"/>a German village on the confines of Flanders, in which latter country this artist appears<lb facs="P9_TL00046"/>chiefly to have resided; and therefore in most of his prints we may observe the Flemish<lb facs="P9_TL00047"/>costume of his time. From the pointed shoes that we see in one of the figures it must have<lb facs="P9_TL00048"/>been executed between the year 1460, and 1470; about which latter period the broad«toed<lb facs="P9_TL00049"/>4<lb facs="P9_TL00050"/>shoes came into fashion in France and Flanders. It seems to have been intended as a pattern<lb facs="P9_TL00051"/>for goldsmith's work, probably a cup or &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00052"/>&amp; The artist, In a fancy representation of foliage, has introduced several figures belonging<lb facs="P9_TL00053"/>to a Flemish May game morris consisting of the lady of the May, the fool, the piper, two<lb facs="P9_TL00054"/>morris dancers with bells and streamers, and four other dancing characters, for which<lb facs="P9_TL00055"/>appropriate names will not easily be found. The similitude between some of the figures in<lb facs="P9_TL00056"/>this print and others in Mr Tollett's window is very striking, and shows that the period of<lb facs="P9_TL00057"/>execution, as to both, was nearly the same.

To trace their<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>original forms and numbers, or the progressive changes they underwent, with any degree<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>of accuracy, would be perhaps impossible; because not only the materials for such an attempt<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>are extremely few, but a variety of circumstances contributed to constitute their differences<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>even during the same period. Wherever we turn, nothing but irregularity presents itself.<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>Sometimes we have a Lady of The May, simply, with a friar Tuck; and in later times a Maid<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>Marion remained without even a Robin Hood or a friar. But consistency is not to be looked<lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>for on these occasions, when we find, as has been remarked, that the May games, those of<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>Robin Hood, the ales, and morris dances, were blended together as convenience or caprice<lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>happened to dictate. (1<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>The several characters that seem in more ancient times to have composed the May game<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>and morris were the following: Robin Hood, Little John, Friar Tuck, Maid Marian the queen<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>or lady of the May, the fool, the piper, and several morris dancers habited, as it appears,<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>in various modes. Afterwards a hobby horse, and a dragon were added. To avoid the confusion<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>that might otherwise ensue, it will be best to speak of each character by &amp;<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>I. ROBIN HOOD. The history of this celebrated outlaw has been so ably and ingeniously<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>treated by Mr Ritson, and every fact that relates to him so minutely developed, that it<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>will be long before any novelty shall be discovered of sufficient importance to deserve<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>attention. It appears that in the May game he sometimes carried a painted standard. (2)<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>11. LITTLE JOHN. The faithful companion of Robin Hood, but of whom little that is<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>not fabulous has been handed down to us. He is first mentioned, together with Robin Hood,<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>by Fordurn the Scotish historian, who wrote in the fourteenth century, and who speaks of<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>the celebration of the story of these persons in the theatrical performances of his time,<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>and of the minstrels' songs relating to them, which he says the common people preferred<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>to all other romances. (3)<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>111. FRIAR TUCK. There is no very ancient mention of this person, whose history Is<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>very uncertain. Drayton has thus recorded him, among other companions of Robin Hood;<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>44 Of Tuck the merry friar which many a sermon made.<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>In praise of Robin Hood, his outlaws and their trade. " (4)<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>He is known to have formed one of the characters in the May games during the reign of<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>Henry the Eighth, and had been probably introduced into them at a much earlier period.<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>From the occurrence of this name on other occasions, there is good reason for supposing<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>that it was a sort of generic appellation tor any friar, and that it originated from the dress</ab>

Accordingly he is very differently<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>accoutred in the Flemish print. He has a cap<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>or hood with asses' ears, and a row of bells<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>for the crest; in his left hand he carries a<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>bauble, and over his right arm hangs a cloth<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>or napkin.

The former gentleman had apparently misconceived the<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>following passage in Fletcher's 44 Two Noble Kinsmen ",<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>44 and next the fool,<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>The Bavian, with long tail and eke long tool,"<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>Here are not two fools described. The construction is, " next comes the fool, i.e. the<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>Bavian fool, etc. " This might have been the idiot fool, and so denominated from his wearing<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>a bib, in French bavon, (i) because he drivelled. Thus in bonduca, Act V., Decius talks<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>of a44 dull slavering" fooi." The tricks of the Bavian, his tumbling like a dog, suggested<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>perhaps by the conduct of Robert the Devil when disguised as a fool in his well known<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>and once popular romance, were peculiar to the morris dance described in 44 The Two Noble<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>Kinsmen ", which has some other characters that seem to have been introduced for stage<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>effect, and not to have belonged to the genuine morris. The tail was the fox tail that was<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>sometimes worn by the morris fool; and the long tool will be best understood by referring<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>to the cut of the idiot in the genuine copy of the dance of death usually, though improperly,<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>ascribed to Holbein, and by reflecting on some peculiar properties and qualifications of the<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>idiot character. &amp; &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00048"/>S&amp; What Mr Tollett has termed a bib was in fact no uncommon part of the male dress in<lb facs="P11_TL00049"/>the fifteenth century.

(2) In the absense of some of the other characters<lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>in the morris dance, the exertions of the fool appear to have been increased, as we learn<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>from Ben Jonson ' s " Entertainment at Althrope<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>But see the hobby-horse is forgot.<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>Foole, it must be your lot,<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>To supply his want with faces<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>And some other buffon graces,<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>You know h0w."...<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>&amp; Coryat relates that near Montreuil he saw " a Whitsuntide foole, disguised like a foole,<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>wearing a long coate, wherein there were many severall peeces of cloth of divers colours,<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>at the corners whereof there hanged the tailes of squirrels: he bestowed a little peece<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>/ of plate, wherein was expressed the effigies of the Virgin Mary, upon every one that<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>gave him money: for he begged money of all travellers for the benefite of the parish<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>church. "(3) &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>&amp; The romance of " The spiritual Quixote " has a morris fool with a fox' s tail depending<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>from his cap, and a sheep bell attached to his hinder parts. In the modern morris dance the<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>fool is continued, but his real character and dress appear to have been long since forgotten.<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>In some places he is called the squire.</ab>

IV. 388, by Sir John Hawkins, who was clearly of opinion that the<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>morris dance was derived from the Moors.<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>(2) Etymologlcum Anglicanum. In further corroboration of this deduction of the morris<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>dance, the following words may be adduced; Moresque a kind of grotesque painting,<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>sometimes called Arabesque, and used in embroidery and damasking. Moriscle, and Mouricle,<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>a gold coin used in Spain by the Moors, and called in the barbarous Latin of the fourteenth<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>century morikinus. See Carpentier, Suppl. and glossar. JDucangian. v. Morikinus.<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>Morris wax, called likewise mores wax, In the Garbelling of spices, 1594, 4to. To<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>these the morris-pike may perhaps be added. It is probable that the English terms<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>morris and morice have been corrupted from mores, the older and more genuine<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>orthography.<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>(3) Tabourot Orchesographie, 1589, 4*o, p. 97» where the several postures of this dance<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>are described and represented. The Pyrrhic dance appears to have travelled from Greece<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>into the North.

The Pope had<lb facs="P10_TL00050"/>been long dismissed by proclamation or act of parliament; and the Devil is probably forgotten<lb facs="P10_TL00051"/>by some, or become an object of too much terror with others to be sported with.<lb facs="P10_TL00052"/>(2) Churchwarden's accounts at Kingston, in Lyson's 44 Environs of London vol. p. 227.

Hence the middle age Latin term for a fool,<lb facs="P11_TL00054"/>bavosus. See Ducange Gloss. This is a very plausible etymology, and might stand well<lb facs="P11_TL00055"/>enough by itself; but it must not be concealed that in some of the Northern languages bavian<lb facs="P11_TL00056"/>signifies a monkey or baboon. Whether Fletcher, who seems the only writer that has<lb facs="P11_TL00057"/>made use of this word, applied it to the fool in question on account of the monckey tricks<lb facs="P11_TL00058"/>that he played, remains to be ascertained. If we could discover the names of the characters<lb facs="P11_TL00059"/>In a French, Dutch, or German morris of this time, some light might be thrown on the subject.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P13_TL00004"/>| nzy actors (and most actors are more or less lazy, according to whether they are<lb facs="P13_TL00005"/>Englishmen, Frenchmen or Germans,) want the theatre to go on doing the same old<lb facs="P13_TL00006"/>thing that it has always done year after year, and are always telling the enthusiasts<lb facs="P13_TL00007"/>that what was good enough for John Kemble or Talma or Schroder is good enough for<lb facs="P13_TL00008"/>them. They only make use of these names because they know nothing about the men. If<lb facs="P13_TL00009"/>they enquired they would find that these were the very men who were the enthusiasts<lb facs="P13_TL00010"/>of their times, and that these were the very men that worked to preserve the ancient<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>traditions of the stage, but who were helpless to fight against the stupidity of the lazy<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>actors of their generation. &amp; Talma, for Instance; listen to Talma:.... &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>&amp;In Mdlle. George's "Memoirs" she says,44 How many times have I seen him (Talma) in<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>" righteous wrath against this bad taste and stinginess (alluding to the scenery)." "You<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>make us look like fools with your paltry meanness." So said Talma. And Mdlle. George<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>goes on to add, " Poor Talma, he was so much in love with classicism that he wanted to<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>re-establish the chorus in 4 (Bdipus \ " Music, he said, 44 elevates the soul and poetises it, but<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>44 to speak of it to these dunderheads is trouble lost." 44 See," he said to me, 44 Stow they<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>44 are encrusted in their old habits. They think I am introducing a red cap when I speak of<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>44 innovation so necessary to our art.<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>&amp; Here is a picture indeed; what a queer state of affairs! Talma, the greatest Influence<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>in the French theatre of his time, helplessly throwing up his hands because the dunderheads<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>will not let him revive some of the noblest traditions of the stage ! It is pitiful. It reveals<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>in a moment the cold-blooded determination of the men of the theatre to prevent their<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>home being refreshed by any innovation. Innovation ? Why, it is not even that which they<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>prevent and have always prevented. They have even prevented the return to fine traditions.<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>Here is Talma desiring the return of the chorus and they accuse him of innovation ! z?<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>&amp; Is there anything to say after this ? No, but there is something to be done, that is to<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>sweep these people out of the theatre, and until the theatre is quite free from them,<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>it will never recover its vitality for you cannot expect vitality in a charnal house<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>where dead things are preserved and honoured by worms, bats and the rest. £? &amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>But I think they are in for it this century. I think the thing has got to be settled one<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>way or another. They have either to go out of the theatre or they have to let vitality into<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>the theatre. Everything is undergoing this process of reform and revolution and it does<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>not matter much which method we apply to the theatre, the reform or revolution will<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>come.<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>The thing people have to get out of their heads is this, that the playwrights have<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>anything to do either with reform or revolution in the theatre. The playwright steps into<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>the theatre only if he is invited in and always after the theatre has been revived or<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>reborn. It is because people do not realize this that they invariably look in the direction<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>of the playwrights when speaking of the possible reform of the theatre. They believe that<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>the matter lies in the hands of the playwrights, but if you will think for a moment you<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>will see that what I say is true and that the playwrights can never reform the theatre nor<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>give it a new birth.<lb facs="P13_TL00045"/>A new family going into an already furnished house cannot change the entire appearance<lb facs="P13_TL00046"/>of that house. It is only the landlord who can do this, and the playwrights are not the<lb facs="P13_TL00047"/>landlords of the stage. It is the stage managers and the actors who are the landlords.<lb facs="P13_TL00048"/>Today the stage manager is more powerful than he was a century ago or even thirty<lb facs="P13_TL00049"/>years ago. It is the stage manager who will reform the theatre or who will give it re<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Having<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>succeeded In his suit he frequently sets out to crush some more Ottomites, or roll the<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>audacious Libyan In some more dust, when he allows himself to be made very jealous by<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>anonymous letters, and he abruptly leaves the army to lead itself, in order that he may go<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>home and tax his wife with her infidelity. On arriving chez lui the tragedy lover not<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>unfrequently finds his wife engaged in conversation with her own brother, who won't say<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>he is her brother, but prefers fighting a duel with the tragedy lover; and the latter returns<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>to his wife with a fatal wound just in time to die in her arms, which sends her raving mad;<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>while the brother, in a fit of remorse, commits suicide. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>&amp; The operatic lover bears some resemblance to the lover we have just disposed of; though<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>he usually confines his violence to tearing up marriage contracts, stamping on the bits,<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>shaking his fist in his rival's face, and rushing out with a drawn sword, shrieking as he makes<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>his exit to the highest pitch of his falsetto. When the course of his love happens to run<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>tolerably smooth, he indulges in poetic declarations of his affection, which he compares<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>to a variety of objects in a strain resembling the following:— &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>Like to the golden orb of day,<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>Which sets upon the main;<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>Going awhile at night away,<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>And coming back again.<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>Or like the little polar star,<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>That guides the ship at sea:<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>The constant friend of ev' ry tar-<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>Such is my love for thee.<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>A beacon to a fainting crew,<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>To point the way to land;<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>A drop of precious mountain dew<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>On Afric's burning sand.<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>The avalanche which ne'er can fall,<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>Wherever it may be,<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>Without its overwhelming all—<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>Such is my love for thee.<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>The lover of the ballet belongs to quite another class. He usually expresses his affec=<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>lion by pirouettes; and having heard that it is love which makes the world go round, he<lb facs="P14_TL00051"/>thinks probably that his spinning may be taken as a proof of his sincerity. The lover in<lb facs="P14_TL00052"/>the ballet evinces his affection very frequently by allowing the object of his choice to drop<lb facs="P14_TL00053"/>into his arms with one of her legs in the air, or to fall suddenly with all her weight into<lb facs="P14_TL00054"/>his open hand, while he, supported on only one knee, bears the burden with a smile<lb facs="P14_TL00055"/>though every muscle is on the strain, and it costs him the most intense exertion to main--'</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00002"/>tain his equilibrium. The lovers in a ballet are generally torn apart by the rude hands of<lb facs="P17_TL00003"/>parents, who, however, wait for the conclusion of a pas de deux before they interpose their<lb facs="P17_TL00004"/>authority, which they take care to exercise within proper Terpsichorean iimits—always<lb facs="P17_TL00005"/>giving the young couple time to fall into a graceful attitude, and receive whatever applause<lb facs="P17_TL00006"/>the public may seem disposed to bestow on it. &amp; jg? &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00007"/>lhe comedy lover goes by the technical name of the "walking gentleman," a title<lb facs="P17_TL00008"/>probably derived from his always having his hat in his hand, as if he would shortly have<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>to walk off at the instigation of some unreasonable father or testy guardian. The comedy<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>lover is very much addicted to ducks and dissatisfaction, wearing white trousers in all<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>weathers, and finding fault upon all occasions with the object of his choice, without any<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>reason for doing so. If the lady is in good spirits, the following is the sort of speech the<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>comedy lover will address to her:— " Nay, Laura, I do not like this gaiety. The volatile<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>head bespeaks the hollow heart; and if you would smile on me to-day, you might bestow<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>your sunshine on another to-morrow. Believe me', Laura, that though we may admire the<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>gadfly for its wings, we shall never seek it for its society, and though we may chase the<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>butterfly for its colours, we cherish the canary for its constancy. You weep, Laura—nay,<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>I did not mean to distress you, though I had rather bring tears from your eyes than allow<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>levity to remain at your heart, for steadiness of character is a brighter gem than the most<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>glittering gewgaw. I will leave you now, Laura, and remember, that even should fate<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>divide us, you have no truer friend than Arthur Turniptop. " jg? <lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>The farce lover is the lowest in the dramatic scale, for he is not unfrequently a scamp,<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>and it would sometimes be difficult to distinguish him from a swindler. He is usually<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>wholly destitute of means, and quite averse to any respectable occupation. He seldom<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>enters a house like a gentleman, but sneaks in by the assistance of a pert and dishonest<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>maid, or comes like a thief over a garden wall or through an open window. If the master<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>of the house should be heard approaching, the farce lover gets under the table, or crams<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>himself into a cupboard already full of crockery, some of which he begins to break as if to<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>make the place of his concealment known to the " old man, " who, instead of going at once<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>to ascertain the cause, walks away to fetch a blunderbus, a red-hot poker, or some other<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>equally murderous instrument, which he would certainly be hanged for making effective<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>use of. While he is gone the farce lover takes the opportunity of leaping from the window,<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>instead of quietly going out at the door, and the " old man," after threatening to fire into<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>the cupboard, bursts it open, and concludes that, as there is no one there, a mouse must<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>have made all the noise and done all the mischief. The farce lover usually parts from the<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>object of his affections with great spirit and vivacity, although he has just before been<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>lisping out something very sentimental about fate presenting " inthuperable obthtacles "<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>to his union.</ab>

He frequently has his arms and<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>legs bare, but, as if he had shrunk within himself, his skin or fleshing is frequently too<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>large for him, and forms folds of a most extraordinary kind at the Joints of his knees or<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>elbows.

                                       <lb facs="P19_TL00011"/>&amp; It therefore seems strange that instead of using their senses people should use their<lb facs="P19_TL00012"/>brains so much. I am speaking of a brain that is at war with the senses, a brain that<lb facs="P19_TL00013"/>tries to master the finer senses.<lb facs="P19_TL00014"/>For instance, 1 am no clearer after reading a chapter of Croce' s " Aesthetic " than 1<lb facs="P19_TL00015"/>was after having worked for a year or two towards creating a work of art, but I am very<lb facs="P19_TL00016"/>much clearer after reading a chapter of Flammarion on Astronomy than I was after contem®<lb facs="P19_TL00017"/>plating those beautiful worlds for a life time. There must be something very wrong with<lb facs="P19_TL00018"/>Croce and very right with Flammarion. Why should the stars be easier to apprehend than<lb facs="P19_TL00019"/>"Aesthetic?" Flammarion, that man whose very name spunds like the whirl of a comet,<lb facs="P19_TL00020"/>makes everything clear to us; he gives us the stars, sun, moon, and all, whereas Croce<lb facs="P19_TL00021"/>gives us nothing, not even " Aesthetic." Flammarion respects the problem and bows to<lb facs="P19_TL00022"/>it as beyond solution: Croce attempts to solve the riddle by much argument. He does not<lb facs="P19_TL00023"/>make a straightforward appeal to our senses, or a subtle appeal to our mind, neither does<lb facs="P19_TL00024"/>he insinuate himself into us by any magic way of his own: he does not charm us, he does<lb facs="P19_TL00025"/>not whisper, he does not shout; he simply goes on, on, on we leave him to go<lb facs="P19_TL00026"/>on His book is a mass of words, words, words. It is another instance of not being<lb facs="P19_TL00027"/>able to see the wood for the trees. In this instance the trees are so closely packed together<lb facs="P19_TL00028"/>that it is impossible to go through &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00029"/>&amp; How strange it is that men who wish to write on such subjects as Croce has chosen,<lb facs="P19_TL00030"/>on the Aesthetic, on Logic and on the Philosophy of the Practical, do not first see the<lb facs="P19_TL00031"/>wisdom of being born poets, for only poets can explain these extraordinary things to us.<lb facs="P19_TL00032"/>Reading a page of Whitman or Shakespeare you will be aware of more Logic, Aesthetic and<lb facs="P19_TL00033"/>Philosoply of the Practical than in the whole of Croce' s work. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00034"/>Croce' s translator tells us that he (Croce) "is ready to meet any one on equal terms<lb facs="P19_TL00035"/>"and try with them to get at the truth on any subject, be it historical, literary or<lb facs="P19_TL00036"/>" philosophical." Again how extraordinary that he overlooked the importance of being<lb facs="P19_TL00037"/>born a poet! &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00038"/>Poets and Dreamers solve problems and show us how simple is the solution of every<lb facs="P19_TL00039"/>problem. Columbus solved a problem but Croce solves no problem. Had he been sitting<lb facs="P19_TL00040"/>opposite Columbus at the table when the celebrated egg was produced he would have begun<lb facs="P19_TL00041"/>to talk about the inside of the egg, and how later on the chicken, if allowed to emerge,<lb facs="P19_TL00042"/>would have stood on its own legs, which is extremely clever but right away from the<lb facs="P19_TL00043"/>point. The point was how, then and there, to make that egg stand up; and any ordinary<lb facs="P19_TL00044"/>little painter of twenty years experience is able to tell us more vital truths about "Aesthetic"<lb facs="P19_TL00045"/>because of his technical knowledge of one craft than Croce with all his theory which he<lb facs="P19_TL00046"/>has gathered together about Art. <lb facs="P19_TL00047"/>Croce is an example of modern degeneration. I think it is hardly possible that a book<lb facs="P19_TL00048"/>such as his could have been written when Leonardo da Vinci was alive. In those days<lb facs="P19_TL00049"/>people talked about things after they had done them; and, when you come to think of it,<lb facs="P19_TL00050"/>of what use is the opinion of any one but that man whose practise has revealed to him<lb facs="P19_TL00051"/>what is true and what is false?<lb facs="P19_TL00052"/>&amp; The innumerable books that have been written about the theatre, of what value are<lb facs="P19_TL00053"/>they unless written by a man who has practised that which he defines? These theorists<lb facs="P19_TL00054"/>are all utterly unpractical and it is amazing how people will listen to them, for these</ab>

We shall hear about the psychology of everything when<lb facs="P21_TL00013"/>everything is pointing to decay.<lb facs="P21_TL00014"/>&amp; What need is there to bring this word " psychology" Into this simple and beautiful<lb facs="P21_TL00015"/>matter at all ? What has it got to do with it ? We are concerned with an art and a craft.<lb facs="P21_TL00016"/>Our work is essentially a practical osse. jZ? &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00017"/>«£? All art is the result of something Intensely practical, and we are trying to confuse it<lb facs="P21_TL00018"/>and make it indirect and mysterious by the use of this word psychology. jZ?<lb facs="P21_TL00019"/>&lt;£? Nothing strikes two or more beholders in the same manner except those very simple<lb facs="P21_TL00020"/>things which are most direct in their appeal, Set us almost say the commonplace things.<lb facs="P21_TL00021"/>Thus none of the beholders will see one and the same thing in that which they behold.<lb facs="P21_TL00022"/>jZ? It is never to be forgotten that in the theatre we make our appeal to some thousands<lb facs="P21_TL00023"/>of different people. Appealing to their minds we shall impress each one differently.<lb facs="P21_TL00024"/>Appealing to anything but their common sense we shall fall. &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00025"/>We must call a spade a spade, and in two words, not in twenty, and it Is absolutely<lb facs="P21_TL00026"/>immaterial to us whether it is explained to us that the spade is rounded or square at the<lb facs="P21_TL00027"/>edge. It is quite unnecessary whether we are given to understand that there is a little<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>mud on the blade which suggests that the spade comes from Wiltshire, or whether there is<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>a trade mark on the handle which shows that it was made in America. These details explained<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>at length with great subtlety will not make us recognize the spade any better, because the<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>special mud from Wiltshire and the American trade mark convey little; but, if it is a golden<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>spade or a silver spade that everybody will recognize, it is unnecessary then to explain it.<lb facs="P21_TL00033"/>It has appealed to our common sense; in short it is quit© unnecessary even to call it a<lb facs="P21_TL00034"/>spade. &amp; zz? zz? &amp; zz? &amp; zz?<lb facs="P21_TL00035"/>&amp; And so it is with acting. Everything must be direct and simple in its appeal. Whether<lb facs="P21_TL00036"/>it be in tragedy or comedy, the appeal must be through the senses, not through the<lb facs="P21_TL00037"/>brain, for when we begin to think about the tragic or the comic we shall neither weep<lb facs="P21_TL00038"/>nor laugh.jZ? jz? &amp; &amp; jgr jZ? &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00039"/>So whether we are actors, stage managers or even scene painters, our study must be<lb facs="P21_TL00040"/>how to reach everyone in the theatre simultaneously so that they may respond simul<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P21_TL00041"/>taneously. When we know how to do this we shall know how to deal in essentials and<lb facs="P21_TL00042"/>not in details, and the details will be thrown out into the scene dock. For instance let us<lb facs="P21_TL00043"/>take a single example. The scene is a large waiting-room in which are seated the near<lb facs="P21_TL00044"/>friends and relations of one who is dying in the next room. With the dying man are his<lb facs="P21_TL00045"/>nearest relations and one friend, a woman. Very soon this woman has to come into the<lb facs="P21_TL00046"/>room where the friends and relations are all gathered and convey to them that the man is<lb facs="P21_TL00047"/>dead. How shall she do this in the most direct way, so that there shall be no mistake, no<lb facs="P21_TL00048"/>offence? how, in short, shall she call a spade a spade to our satisfaction? You may say there<lb facs="P21_TL00049"/>are many ways. Can you think of one? If she goes on to the stage and commences to talk<lb facs="P21_TL00050"/>a great deal it is quite likely that many of us may be confused as to what she has to say.<lb facs="P21_TL00051"/>If she remains silent we are still left in doubt. In what way can she convey the event to<lb facs="P21_TL00052"/>us? By an action. But what action? What action shall convey the sorrow of the fact and<lb facs="P21_TL00053"/>shall be so solemn that it prevents the flood-gates of sentiment breaking loose ? It is to<lb facs="P21_TL00054"/>create such action that the actor has been born; it is to avoid the trouble of it that he<lb facs="P21_TL00055"/>has made an alliance with psychology.

Let the actor think<lb facs="P22_TL00011"/>how he can make the sound of his voice beautiful so that on hearing it people shall want<lb facs="P22_TL00012"/>to listen to the sound. Let him not think that life can say that which is light or profound<lb facs="P22_TL00013"/>if his voice is never to float or fall, to glide or to leap, to run and to pull up abruptly.<lb facs="P22_TL00014"/>These and thousands of other moods and changes.

A question worthy asking!.... it would be strange if some<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>mystic has not already ventured on the same kind of thing. There are proceedings of §uch<lb facs="P22_TL00032"/>a delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness and make them<lb facs="P22_TL00033"/>unrecognisable; there are actions of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after which<lb facs="P22_TL00034"/>nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby<lb facs="P22_TL00035"/>obscures his recollection.

                                    <lb facs="P23_TL00005"/>Jn the Italian Group we find that with two exceptions—Othello and the Two Gentlemen<lb facs="P23_TL00006"/>of Verona—there is nothing In the text of any of them indicative of time other than<lb facs="P23_TL00007"/>that of the period at which Shakespere wrote them. In Othello there is a scene laid in<lb facs="P23_TL00008"/>Cyprus, which is never acted, consisting of these six lines:—<lb facs="P23_TL00009"/>Othello. These letters give, lago, to the pilot;<lb facs="P23_TL00010"/>And, by him, do my duties to the Senate;<lb facs="P23_TL00011"/>That done, I will be walking on the works,—<lb facs="P23_TL00012"/>Repair there to me.<lb facs="P23_TL00013"/>lago. Well, my good lord, I'll do't,<lb facs="P23_TL00014"/>Othello. This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see ' t ?<lb facs="P23_TL00015"/>Gentlemen. We' 11 wait upon your lordship. (Exeunt.)<lb facs="P23_TL00016"/>This is alone sufficient to show that Cyprus was not only garrisoned by Venetian troops<lb facs="P23_TL00017"/>but that the port where Othello lived was being fortified during the period of the action.<lb facs="P23_TL00018"/>Now, as Cyprus was taken by the Turks in 1570, and the Venetian garrison was first quartered<lb facs="P23_TL00019"/>there in 1471, we must seek between these years the time for Othello' s occupation. &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00020"/>From 1471 to 1489 the island, although defended by Venetian soldiers, was nominally<lb facs="P23_TL00021"/>ruled by Catherine Cornaro; but in the year last mentioned she resigned all her rights in<lb facs="P23_TL00022"/>favour of the Republic, and Venice maintained peaceful possession until the Cyprian wars,<lb facs="P23_TL00023"/>which ended (after Othello's death) with the Turkish victory of May 1570. War, however,<lb facs="P23_TL00024"/>has been declared before the play opens, for in the very first scene, lago, speaking of Othello<lb facs="P23_TL00025"/>says: s s.. he's embark'd<lb facs="P23_TL00026"/>With such loud reason to the Cyprus' wars,<lb facs="P23_TL00027"/>(Which even now stand in act,)....<lb facs="P23_TL00028"/>And in the third scene we learn that the Turks, with a fleet counting between one and two<lb facs="P23_TL00029"/>hundred galleys, had been seen "bearing up to Cyprus," but had changed their course<lb facs="P23_TL00030"/>" toward the isle of Rhodes, " and there, Joined by a second fleet of thirty sail, were seen to<lb facs="P23_TL00031"/>.... restem<lb facs="P23_TL00032"/>Their backward course bearing with frank appearance<lb facs="P23_TL00033"/>Their purposes towards Cyprus.<lb facs="P23_TL00034"/>jg? This expedition, however, came to grief, for a " desperate tempest" scattered the fleet<lb facs="P23_TL00035"/>and brought it to entire or " mere perdition," as the Venetian Herald calls it. But the<lb facs="P23_TL00036"/>course described in the text exactly tallies with that which was actually pursued in the<lb facs="P23_TL00037"/>early part of the year 1570 under the Ottoman leader, Mustapha, who, after weathering<lb facs="P23_TL00038"/>the equinoxial gales, made his successful attack on Cyprus in the following May. We may<lb facs="P23_TL00039"/>therefore conclude that the play refers us to the Spring of 1570, or thirty=two years before</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P24_TL00003"/>it was first acted. This brings us so near to Shakespere's own day that it is scarcely<lb facs="P24_TL00004"/>necessary for us to make any distinction between the costume of this play and that of the<lb facs="P24_TL00005"/>Merchant of Venice, which I purpose to describe in detail. (1) It may be noted, however,<lb facs="P24_TL00006"/>that there are still remains of mediaeval buildings sufficient to show that the town of<lb facs="P24_TL00007"/>Famagusta.... doubtless the sea«port where Othello lived, and which the Venetians were<lb facs="P24_TL00008"/>fortifying in 1570.... was a place of Importance In an architectural point of view long<lb facs="P24_TL00009"/>before the Venetian occupation of the island. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00010"/>&amp; The play off Othello contains fifteen scenes, three exhibiting the architecture of Venice<lb facs="P24_TL00011"/>and the other twelve that of Famagusta. We need only look at them as they are placed<lb facs="P24_TL00012"/>In the text to see how easily they may be modified to suit the modern fashion of a set<lb facs="P24_TL00013"/>scene for nearly each act.<lb facs="P24_TL00014"/>The first Act consists of three scenes In Venice.<lb facs="P24_TL00015"/>1. A street. 2. Another street.<lb facs="P24_TL00016"/>3. A council chamber: Duke and senators sitting; officers attending.<lb facs="P24_TL00017"/>•&lt;£? The first street or place is opposite the palace of the Magnifico Brabantio. The second<lb facs="P24_TL00018"/>is close to the arsenal, the sagittary or sagitarius being a piece of sculpture marking (most<lb facs="P24_TL00019"/>Venetian houses had their special marks) the entrance to the residences or quarters of the<lb facs="P24_TL00020"/>superior officers. This second street might serve quite well for the first scene if, in cutting<lb facs="P24_TL00021"/>the text to prepare it for modern acting, our stage editors would finish the scene at that<lb facs="P24_TL00022"/>speech of lago' s beginning with the words,<lb facs="P24_TL00023"/>Call up her father,<lb facs="P24_TL00024"/>Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,<lb facs="P24_TL00025"/>Then exit Roderigo. lago, retiring in an opposite direction, meets Othello, and so returns<lb facs="P24_TL00026"/>for the second scene. (2) This scene may be rendered very effective if arranged as shown in</ab>

Boundary walls,<lb facs="P24_TL00034"/>gateways, and low towers, with a background<lb facs="P24_TL00035"/>of ships of war, would form the elements<lb facs="P24_TL00036"/>of this scene, and the style of the buildings<lb facs="P24_TL00037"/>may include old brick walls as well as new</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P24_TL00038"/>stone work, the latter of course being in the Renaissance style of the Library of St. Mark or<lb facs="P24_TL00039"/>of the Vandramini, Grimani, or the old Cornaro palaces, built or designed between 1520 and<lb facs="P24_TL00040"/>2350. A scene set like this would necessitate the fall of the curtain in order to prepare the<lb facs="P24_TL00041"/>last and the most sumptuous scene in the whole play; viz, the Council Chamber in the Doge's<lb facs="P24_TL00042"/>palace. For this, however, I refer my readers to my notes on The Merchant of Venice. For the<lb facs="P24_TL00043"/>rest of this play we are in Cyprus. In the second Act we have three scenes, but there<lb facs="P24_TL00044"/>appears to me no reason why one scene should not suffice for all. The text gives <lb facs="P24_TL00045"/>1. A seaport town in Cyprus.<lb facs="P24_TL00046"/>2. A street.<lb facs="P24_TL00047"/>3. A hall in the castle.<lb facs="P24_TL00048"/>J? The first direction is very vague, and we must therefore go to the text to seek a definite<lb facs="P24_TL00049"/>meaning for it. There we find that the first scene is a kind of open or public courtyard<lb facs="P24_TL00050"/>to the citadel or castle, that close outside it is the harbour or bay with the quay or landing"<lb facs="P24_TL00051"/>place, and that the castle or the residence of the commander or governor of the island is<lb facs="P24_TL00052"/>on one side of it. Standing in this halfpublic sort of courtyard we hear the shouts of the<lb facs="P24_TL00053"/>people who line the brow o' the sea; "we see the blocks of stone scattered about, and<lb facs="P24_TL00054"/>the new works "in all the usual confusion of builders' mess and muddle. Here, on the<lb facs="P24_TL00055"/>right, through an archway newly built, with the lion of St. Mark roughed out on its frieze<lb facs="P24_TL00056"/>we see the hill that leads to the town on one side of it. At the back of the scene rises the</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P25_TB00002">
                                    <lb facs="P25_TL00002"/>fifteenth century castle with its broad stairs leading to the great entrance doorway, from<lb facs="P25_TL00003"/>the castle to the other side of the scene stretches the sixteenth century fortified wall, half<lb facs="P25_TL00004"/>built, outside which steps conduct down to the lower line of fortification and the quay<lb facs="P25_TL00005"/>beyond; through a tower gateway on the extreme left we get a glimpse of further<lb facs="P25_TL00006"/>fortifications and the new works thereof, and there, too, is the guard-room with an open<lb facs="P25_TL00007"/>arcade, under which, in the third scene, the drinking party would begin their revels. In<lb facs="P25_TL00008"/>such a scene as this 1 have thus roughly and very imperfectly sketched, if properly set,<lb facs="P25_TL00009"/>composed and painted, the whole of the second and third acts may be represented. I say<lb facs="P25_TL00010"/>the third, because the short second scene, which is the only one inside the castle, might<lb facs="P25_TL00011"/>just as well be before the castle as not. The fourth act contains three scenes: <lb facs="P25_TL00012"/>1. Before the castle.<lb facs="P25_TL00013"/>2. A room in the castle.<lb facs="P25_TL00014"/>3. Another room In the castle.<lb facs="P25_TL00015"/>There is no reason that I can discover why there should be two different rooms for the<lb facs="P25_TL00016"/>second and third scenes, nor can I see why the first scene should not be inside instead of<lb facs="P25_TL00017"/>before the castle, except for the presence of Bianca the courtezan, and this may be rendered<lb facs="P25_TL00018"/>as possible to an interior as to the courtyard if we make the room open through a cloister,<lb facs="P25_TL00019"/>corridor, or double arcade to the courtyard at the back. Bianca might then ascend by two<lb facs="P25_TL00020"/>or three steps just under the arches without in any way violating the probabilities, and<lb facs="P25_TL00021"/>thus a set scene for the whole of the fourth act could be secured. This interior might be<lb facs="P25_TL00022"/>Gothic or Renaissance; if the first, we must bear in mind the fact that the Gothic of Cyprus<lb facs="P25_TL00023"/>had nothing whatever to do with Venetian Gothic, but was more like that of Jerusalem<lb facs="P25_TL00024"/>and even of Central and Northern France. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P25_TL00025"/>&amp; The fifth act contains two scenes:....<lb facs="P25_TL00026"/>1. A street. 2. A bedchamber.<lb facs="P25_TL00027"/>It is impossible in the last Act to do with less than two scenes. The street here is<lb facs="P25_TL00028"/>clearly in the town, and so we may indulge our fancy so far as to group together the<lb facs="P25_TL00029"/>Renaissance of Italy, the Gothic of Syria, the Romanesque of Byzantium, and the ruins of<lb facs="P25_TL00030"/>pre-Christian times.<lb facs="P25_TL00031"/>&amp; We come now to the last scene. And here we find the text agreeing with<lb facs="P25_TL00032"/>the ordinary construction of the bedchamber of the sixteenth century, so that we<lb facs="P25_TL00033"/>need not go out of our way to copy the double stage apparatus of the Elizabethan Theatre.<lb facs="P25_TL00034"/>Desdemona' s bedroom was in plan nothing more nor less than what we still see in many<lb facs="P25_TL00035"/>modern houses on the continent, i.e. the bed-place was an alcove or recess, or, if you<lb facs="P25_TL00036"/>prefer to call it so, a small room with one side open to the chamber proper. Across this<lb facs="P25_TL00037"/>open side, which might be arched, curtains were suspended, and the floor or the bed-place<lb facs="P25_TL00038"/>might be raised three or four steps above the chamber floor. This apartment would naturally<lb facs="P25_TL00039"/>be placed in the best part of the castle, and would therefore be Renaissance work of the<lb facs="P25_TL00040"/>character already mentioned.<lb facs="P25_TL00041"/>The costume of the Venetians in 1570, or twenty years before the date of the Merchant<lb facs="P25_TL00042"/>of Venice, was so like that I propose to describe when 1 come to treat of this last-mentioned<lb facs="P25_TL00043"/>play, that it is unnecessary to dwell on it here. The inhabitants of Cyprus....Othello' s old<lb facs="P25_TL00044"/>acquaintance of the isle....were more or less men of warlike character, and were habited<lb facs="P25_TL00045"/>like Greeks or Persians rather than like western Europeans. The cavalry of the island<lb facs="P25_TL00046"/>were really Greek, and were called Stratigari or Estradiots; they wore tall turban-like hats<lb facs="P25_TL00047"/>with a feather stuck upright in the front, tight guarded or braided bodies, long loose<lb facs="P25_TL00048"/>skirts of a different colour, tight under sleevs, a rich sash, and a sabre suspended behind<lb facs="P25_TL00049"/>by a belt across the right shoulder: one of their sabres may be seen in the collection at<lb facs="P25_TL00050"/>Goodrich Castle.<lb facs="P25_TL00051"/>One word as to the music. Amidst the drinking songs and the old ballad of " Willow "<lb facs="P25_TL00052"/>may not room be found for those charming compositions of Luca Marenzio (1570) and G*o<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

                                    <lb facs="P26_TL00003"/>be chronologically correct I ought to have placed this play before Othello, for the<lb facs="P26_TL00004"/>date of the action must be taken to be prior to 1535, because In that year died Francesco<lb facs="P26_TL00005"/>Sforza, the last Duke who ruled nominally as an independent prince, although really<lb facs="P26_TL00006"/>under the Empire. After Francesco's death the Emperors, Charles V. and Francis 1.,<lb facs="P26_TL00007"/>carried on their contention for the possession of the Duchy, which, in 1540, Charles<lb facs="P26_TL00008"/>added to his other possessions. In 1555 he, however, gave up all to his son Philip, who he<lb facs="P26_TL00009"/>had already created Duke of Milan, and the title became from this a mere appanage of the<lb facs="P26_TL00010"/>Imperial Crown. The tone of the play is thoroughly peaceful, and we have to make our<lb facs="P26_TL00011"/>choice between the later quiet time of 1529=1535, that is, after the treaty of Cambrai, and<lb facs="P26_TL00012"/>earlier period of quiet, such as that which followed the battle of Pavia. The references in<lb facs="P26_TL00013"/>the text to Shakespeare's own time incline me to adopt the later period. jg? <lb facs="P26_TL00014"/>The architectural scenery is divided between Verona and Milan, and may be thus<lb facs="P26_TL00015"/>summarised;—<lb facs="P26_TL00016"/>Verona.—An open place, Act i. Sc. 1; Act ii, Sc. 3.<lb facs="P26_TL00017"/>Julia's house; exterior, Act i. Sc. 2.<lb facs="P26_TL00018"/>~ „ interior, Act ii. Sc. 2 and 7.<lb facs="P26_TL00019"/>Antonio's house; interior, Act i.

A street; Act ii., sc. 5.<lb facs="P26_TL00023"/>The three remaining scenes are laid in the forest near Mantua.<lb facs="P26_TL00024"/>Now, although the Verona of Julia must have been different from the Verona of<lb facs="P26_TL00025"/>Juliet, yet the difference created in the two centuries, which elapsed between the dates<lb facs="P26_TL00026"/>of the two stories, was felt, perhaps, as little there as in any town in Italy. The greatest<lb facs="P26_TL00027"/>change was due to the fortifications erected from the designs of San Michele, who died<lb facs="P26_TL00028"/>in 1549, and who was between 40 and 50 years old at the time I have accepted as the period<lb facs="P26_TL00029"/>of the story of the Two Gentlemen of Verona. But, for a full century before this, the style<lb facs="P26_TL00030"/>of the Renaissance had been practised at the great architectural centre on the other side<lb facs="P26_TL00031"/>of the Apennines, for the Riccardi palace at Florence was begun in 1430, and the Pitt!<lb facs="P26_TL00032"/>palace only five years later. Nearer Julia's home we find that the Vandramini palace at<lb facs="P26_TL00033"/>Venice was begun before she was able to toddle about alone, whilst at Milan the north<lb facs="P26_TL00034"/>wing of the great hospital was commenced as early as 1456 by one Filarete, an architect<lb facs="P26_TL00035"/>of Florence. But whether we " trudge about through fair Verona " or peruse the streets of<lb facs="P26_TL00036"/>Milan, we shall find the builders more or less busy with the fashionable style, pulling down<lb facs="P26_TL00037"/>old walls of Romanesque and Early Pointed character, and setting up in their places a very<lb facs="P26_TL00038"/>free translation of the Classic Orders. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P26_TL00039"/>The open place, square, or wide street of the first scene of Act i. and the third scene<lb facs="P26_TL00040"/>of Act ii., might show, not only the Renaissance, but the other three great phases of<lb facs="P26_TL00041"/>architecture through which Verona had passed. One or two new buildings in the Free<lb facs="P26_TL00042"/>Classic style of the hour would give us, so to speak, the time of day; and the long history<lb facs="P26_TL00043"/>of the little aristocratic town might be traced through Pointed arch and Romanesque shaft<lb facs="P26_TL00044"/>up to the pilasters and friezes of the time of Theodoric the Goth, and so to the still<lb facs="P26_TL00045"/>earlier work of his predecessor. For the general character of these buildings I refer the<lb facs="P26_TL00046"/>reader to my notes on the play of Romeo and Juliet, in the Architect for November 14,<lb facs="P26_TL00047"/>1874. (1) The two houses introduced in the first and second acts are, I need hardly say, palatial<lb facs="P26_TL00048"/>in character, for that Antonio is a nobleman, and Julia the daughter of a nobleman, are<lb facs="P26_TL00049"/>facts settled for us by the text. We may perhaps be allowed to go further and say that<lb facs="P26_TL00050"/>Antonio is an old-fashioned nobleman, for he has kept his son Proteus at home, until<lb facs="P26_TL00051"/>importuned to send him away by his brother, the prior probably of that Franciscan house<lb facs="P26_TL00052"/>where our old friend Friar Lawrence once busied himself in toxicology. Antonio's<lb facs="P26_TL00053"/>servant too is allowed to hold free converse with his 6t lordship," and to counsel his master<lb facs="P26_TL00054"/>in family affairs: from all of which It may not unreasonably be supposed that his palace or<lb facs="P26_TL00055"/>house would be of some age, and if we only give It 200 years we shall find it a fully<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The lady Julia might dwell in a still<lb facs="P27_TL00006"/>older house for, unlike the lady of Belmont, she does not appear to have been a very<lb facs="P27_TL00007"/>desirable match in a financial point of view, for Proteus feared to show his father Julia's<lb facs="P27_TL00008"/>letter lest Antonio should take exception to his love. True It is she lias some landed property,<lb facs="P27_TL00009"/>as well as a house full of goods and chattels, but they are not so great as to prevent her<lb facs="P27_TL00010"/>leaving them at the complete disposal of her maid Lucetta. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P27_TL00011"/>In Milan we have a street, an 44 abbey, " and the ducal palace.

If St be retained we must remember that It Is a convent of friars, and<lb facs="P27_TL00014"/>consequently not an abbey like that of St. Ambrogio, but a priory of one of the four orders,<lb facs="P27_TL00015"/>Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites, or Augustinfans. The streets of a place like Milan in<lb facs="P27_TL00016"/>153S would be brilliant with new cut stone and marble in the style of the Renaissance,<lb facs="P27_TL00017"/>many palaces and houses would have already been built, and many others would be in course<lb facs="P27_TL00018"/>of erection, the place would be quite gay with the fashions of the time, and crowds of new<lb facs="P27_TL00019"/>dresses would be backed up by crowds of new &lt;o&gt;<lb facs="P27_TL00020"/>As Bath is to Wells, or Cheltenham to Gloucester, so Milan was to Verona, and the<lb facs="P27_TL00021"/>scene painter who omits to show us this distinction is guilty of gross neglect altogether<lb facs="P27_TL00022"/>unpardonable in days when real fire-engines, broughams, and such like gear are brought<lb facs="P27_TL00023"/>on the stage with a view to completeness In the realisation of a scene in some fleeting<lb facs="P27_TL00024"/>sensational entertainment. Of the ducal palace, in the rooms and courts of which so much<lb facs="P27_TL00025"/>of the action of the Two Gentlemen of Verona is carried on, we have no remains to guide<lb facs="P27_TL00026"/>us, except the tower of the mediaeval palace erected by Azzo Visconti about 1330. Giotto<lb facs="P27_TL00027"/>(ob. 1336) certainly painted the walls of some of its rooms; and, although portions were<lb facs="P27_TL00028"/>rebuilt during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the fourteenth century was still strongly<lb facs="P27_TL00029"/>marked 011 it up to the time when Gothic and Renaissance together fell before what we<lb facs="P27_TL00030"/>call 44 the hand of modern improvement." The architecture, therefore, of the Milan Palace<lb facs="P27_TL00031"/>may be Gothic of 1330, or Early Renaissance, or both.<lb facs="P27_TL00032"/>&lt;£? The costume of the youths who attended the Imperial Court, of the Emperor—who<lb facs="P27_TL00033"/>might be seen in procession though not found in the dramatis persone—of the Duke of<lb facs="P27_TL00034"/>Milan, of the lords and ladies of Milan and Verona, of Gentlemen from the courts of<lb facs="P27_TL00035"/>Francis or of Henry, of artists from Florence and merchants from Venice—may be sought<lb facs="P27_TL00036"/>in paintings, contemporary MSS., drawings, engravings, and sculpture. But wherever the<lb facs="P27_TL00037"/>theatrical manager may be led to seek for his authorities, it is to be hoped he will be<lb facs="P27_TL00038"/>consistent, and not expect Giorgione, who died in 1511, to furnish him with the costume<lb facs="P27_TL00039"/>of 1530. He must or ought to know that whatever later painters, looking to the past, may<lb facs="P27_TL00040"/>have done, it is impossible that painters who died years before the period we attempt to<lb facs="P27_TL00041"/>illustrate can be fairly regarded as authorities for the fashions of that period. For instance,<lb facs="P27_TL00042"/>Veronese can scarcely be quoted on the costume of 1530, since he was a tiny boy only<lb facs="P27_TL00043"/>when Proteus married Julia. On the other hand, Tintoretto, who was a young man,<lb facs="P27_TL00044"/>and Titian, who had reached a ripe age, may be implicitly followed. But Titian is more<lb facs="P27_TL00045"/>than an authority for us in this play. As a favourite artist .with the Emperor, he might<lb facs="P27_TL00046"/>very possibly have received a summons to attend Charles at Milan, so that we may well<lb facs="P27_TL00047"/>have among the figures in our background the great colourist of Venice. The text of the<lb facs="P27_TL00048"/>Two Gentlemen of Verona supplies many references to costume, e. g.f Thurior's "jerking"<lb facs="P27_TL00049"/>is a doublet; Thurio's servants have 44 bare liveries;" Julia's hair is knit up in silken<lb facs="P27_TL00050"/>strings with 44 odd-connected true-love knots;" and the particular cut of her trunk hose is<lb facs="P27_TL00051"/>specified. Mention is also made of gloves—then manufactured extensively in Italy—sun<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P27_TL00052"/>expelling masks, purses, periwigs, high boots, and long cloaks. &amp;<lb facs="P27_TL00053"/>&amp; The list of moveables includes trenchers, looking-glasses, pictures, salts, a rope ladder<lb facs="P27_TL00054"/>with grappling or 44 anchoring" hooks, tablets (of ivory), and musical] instruments. And<lb facs="P27_TL00055"/>although no doubt the words refer to articles Shakespeare had himself seen, yet there is<lb facs="P27_TL00056"/>nothing inconsistent with the date I have selected for the action, for although the looking<lb facs="P27_TL00057"/>glass was not commonly used until after 1664, when the glass mirror makers of Murano<lb facs="P27_TL00058"/>were incorporated as a distinct guild, we have it on record that in 1507 two men of Murano<lb facs="P27_TL00059"/>claimed before the Council of Ten to have Invented away of making good mirrors of crystal</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P28_TL00004"/>glass, and had a monopoly granted them for twenty years. The " bare liveries " of Thurios'<lb facs="P28_TL00005"/>servants is explained by this passage in the Merchant of Venice—" Give him a livery more<lb facs="P28_TL00006"/>guarded than his fellows, " the guards being the horizontal bars of lace or braid, as we<lb facs="P28_TL00007"/>should now call it, which more or less covered the front of the doublet, and without<lb facs="P28_TL00008"/>which any livery must, by comparison with others, have indeed looked bare. As to the<lb facs="P28_TL00009"/>general fashion of the costume, I refer the reader to the remarks already made on the<lb facs="P28_TL00010"/>costume of this period in my notes on Henry VIII. (1) In our National Gallery we have a portrait<lb facs="P28_TL00011"/>of a lady of Genoa by Paris Bordone (1500-71) which might be copied for Silvia, although<lb facs="P28_TL00012"/>the colour of the hair in the painting is like Jiulia's—" a perfect yellow." Silvia's hair</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P28_TL00014"/>was auburn, and her forehead was low, while Julia's was high, so that we get quite a<lb facs="P28_TL00015"/>charming contrast in the two ladies of the play, whose only point of resemblance seems to<lb facs="P28_TL00016"/>have been In the eyes, which in both were as " grey as glass " (/.e. the glass of Shakespere's<lb facs="P28_TL00017"/>day). Angelo Bronzino(iso2 -72) has supplied us with more than one portrait of the time,<lb facs="P28_TL00018"/>and the actress is free to choose between him and Bordone. We have also by Pontorno<lb facs="P28_TL00019"/>(1494-1556) a life-size full length portrait of a boy in crimson and black, which, merely as a<lb facs="P28_TL00020"/>piece of colonr, would be invaluable in a stage picture. Then, again, from the hand of<lb facs="P28_TL00021"/>Sebastiano del Piombo (1485-1547) we have a likeness of himself, the Cardinal Ippolito<lb facs="P28_TL00022"/>de' Medici, and the lady Giulla Gonzaga of Mantua. At the Kensington Museum there<lb facs="P28_TL00023"/>is also much from which we may derive valuable information in any endeavour to realise<lb facs="P28_TL00024"/>the aspect of persons and things In Northern Italy during the period under consideration.<lb facs="P28_TL00025"/>There we can find almost everything which was required to furnish a palace—chests<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

And yet, with this wealth of authority at<lb facs="P28_TL00033"/>our very doors, is there one theatrical or stage manager in London who takes sufficient<lb facs="P28_TL00034"/>interest in art or education to use even one department of this admirable collection ?</ab>

Is<lb facs="P28_TL00038"/>nature more easily swayed to mirth than moved to pity ? or Is It the disfigurement of<lb facs="P28_TL00039"/>tears which keeps them back ? Immoderate laughter is more unseemly than the bitterest<lb facs="P28_TL00040"/>grief and we ought to be as much ashamed to let others see us laugh as cry. Are we afraid<lb facs="P28_TL00041"/>to be thought soft-hearted, or weak-minded, or easily imposed on by unreal things? We<lb facs="P28_TL00042"/>shall not take into account those strong-minded persons who never give way to either<lb facs="P28_TL00043"/>excessive laughter or to tears, but let us consider for what reason we go to listen to a<lb facs="P28_TL00044"/>tragedy. Is it to laugh? Is truth not as vividly portrayed there as In comedy? Will anything<lb facs="P28_TL00045"/>but truth, let it be in comedy or tragedy, move the soul ? Will people be satisfied with<lb facs="P28_TL00046"/>the improbable ? Therefore, as it is no unusual thing for a theatre to ring with spontaneous<lb facs="P28_TL00047"/>laughter at some amusing hit in a comedy, so also the violent efforts people make to<lb facs="P28_TL00048"/>control their tears and break into forced laughter at some touch of pathos, clearly prove<lb facs="P28_TL00049"/>that giving way to natural emotion should cause no other embarassment than that of drying<lb facs="P28_TL00050"/>our eyes, and having agreed to indulge our feelings in this way, experience will teach us<lb facs="P28_TL00051"/>that there is less fear of being moved to tears at a play than of being made to feel</ab>

It is not always the unexpected which happens; it is sometimes the expected.<lb facs="P31_TL00013"/>We in the street are amazed at comets, but the astronomers know of these things long before<lb facs="P31_TL00014"/>they appear and take their appearance all as a matter of course. Those in the street once<lb facs="P31_TL00015"/>upon a time believed that the sun moved round the earth, but an eccentric gentleman called<lb facs="P31_TL00016"/>Galileo knew that the earth went round the sun. So of course, when it was asserted time<lb facs="P31_TL00017"/>after time in The Mask that masks were the only fit means of expressing those emotions<lb facs="P31_TL00018"/>of the sou! which are registered on the face, those who asserted this were put down as lunatics.<lb facs="P31_TL00019"/>Here again it is the expected that happens. &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00020"/>And now we are going to take another step forward and you will see that what is predicted<lb facs="P31_TL00021"/>will come to pass.<lb facs="P31_TL00022"/>&amp; Before the art of the stage can revive women must have passed off the boards. No<lb facs="P31_TL00023"/>originality is claimed for this idea; it is an idea as old as the hills; it has been tried, and,<lb facs="P31_TL00024"/>like the hills, it was never known to fail, whereas the actress, for many reasons, as I hope<lb facs="P31_TL00025"/>to show in a forthcoming number, has been known to fail lamentably. In saying this I in no<lb facs="P31_TL00026"/>way imply the failure of woman; it is a failure due to circumstances against which nature and<lb facs="P31_TL00027"/>other powerful things oppose themselves.<lb facs="P31_TL00028"/>JS? A section of English women who have banded themselves together are preparing the way<lb facs="P31_TL00029"/>for the exodus of the woman from the theatre. These ladies are called the Suffragettes, and<lb facs="P31_TL00030"/>in doing a little wrong to themselves they are doing a great right to their sisters in the<lb facs="P31_TL00031"/>theatre. They are opening hundreds of other doors through which the women will enter,<lb facs="P31_TL00032"/>and, In entering these, will leave the stage.<lb facs="P31_TL00033"/>Thousands of women who want something to do go 011 to the stage; thousands of women<lb facs="P31_TL00034"/>who want to make a little money go on the stage; but the Suffragettes, by their agitation,<lb facs="P31_TL00035"/>are going to make it possible for these same women to go somewhere else; they are going<lb facs="P31_TL00036"/>to train a new kind of woman, and the new kind of woman will not take kindly to painting<lb facs="P31_TL00037"/>her face since she will have learned by her superior intelligence that paint hurts the skin;<lb facs="P31_TL00038"/>neither will she know how to play those feminine roles which the poets always choose to<lb facs="P31_TL00039"/>write because these characters will be composed of a mass of things which she is opposed<lb facs="P31_TL00040"/>to and which will no longer interest her. Instead of pretending to be the stupid Ophelia she<lb facs="P31_TL00041"/>will have joined some society for saving those who would have committed suicide by drowning;<lb facs="P31_TL00042"/>a far more useful occupation than imitating a drowned lady, instead of pretending to be a<lb facs="P31_TL00043"/>girl who through some spontaneous sweetness of disposition stands up to a Jew in the law<lb facs="P31_TL00044"/>courts of Venice she will be far better occupied in the law courts of Fleet Street. In fact,<lb facs="P31_TL00045"/>when woman lives in the real world, she will leave the mimic world. &lt;£?<lb facs="P31_TL00046"/>jg? If it is suggested that men have not done this though men are in the real world, the<lb facs="P31_TL00047"/>answer is that men take themselves very seridusly as artists and the mimic world becomes<lb facs="P31_TL00048"/>for them the real world. With women it is quite different. And besides, what men and<lb facs="P31_TL00049"/>women do and feel is always different; the two can never be compared. Until I perceived<lb facs="P31_TL00050"/>all this I had less sympathy with the Suffragettes than I have at present when I see the<lb facs="P31_TL00051"/>good they are going to do the theatre, and that these ladies, by doing a little wrong achieve</ab>

Would Miss Prim pick holes? would Carados<lb facs="P32_TL00048"/>laugh the whole thing off as a good joke? Yes, that is just what they would do.

He would grow enthusiastic over the idea that the poet should be his own<lb facs="P33_TL00008"/>mountebank." He is fond of the word mountebank and knows how to pronounce it.

Alas! Everyone must arrive at the conclusion that these gentlemen are essentially<lb facs="P33_TL00016"/>unpractical.

The<lb facs="P37_TL00031"/>mass over, and having received the blessing of the priests, they (the brides) go away and<lb facs="P37_TL00032"/>are led to their husband' s house where the feasting Is renewed. &amp; sz?<lb facs="P37_TL00033"/>&amp; For nearly a year they continue to dress in that fashion, with their hair flowing over<lb facs="P37_TL00034"/>their shoulders, and the golden head-dress, and an ornament on the head like a circle<lb facs="P37_TL00035"/>laden with jewels of great value; and they all display, some by nature and some by exquisite<lb facs="P37_TL00036"/>diligence in art, tresses of the colour of gold with curls according to custom; and wear many<lb facs="P37_TL00037"/>jewels and pendants of great value at their ears, and at the neck strings of pearls instead<lb facs="P37_TL00038"/>of necklaces, which are a marvel to see. &amp;<lb facs="P37_TL00039"/>&lt;£?

" This place (Venice) is much frequented<lb facs="P38_TL00020"/>by the walking may poles, I meane the women. They weare<lb facs="P38_TL00021"/>their coats halfe too long for their bodies, being mounted</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P38_TL00024"/>on their chippeens, (which are as high as a man's leg) they walk between two handmaids,<lb facs="P38_TL00025"/>majestickly deliberating of every step they take. This fashion was invented and appropriated<lb facs="P38_TL00026"/>to the noble Venetian wives, to bee constant to distinguish them from the courtesans, who<lb facs="P38_TL00027"/>goe covered in a vaile of white taffety." £?<lb facs="P38_TL00028"/>■&lt;&amp; James Howell, speaking of the Venetian women, says, " They are low and of small statures<lb facs="P38_TL00029"/>for the most part, which makes them to rayse their bodies upon high shoes called chapins,<lb facs="P38_TL00030"/>which gave one occasion to say that the Venetian ladies were made of three things, one<lb facs="P38_TL00031"/>part of them was wood, meaning their chapins, another part was their apparell, and the<lb facs="P38_TL00032"/>third part was a woman; The Senat hath often endeavoured to take away the wearing of<lb facs="P38_TL00033"/>those high shoes, but all women are so passionately delighted with this kind of state that<lb facs="P38_TL00034"/>no law can weane them from it<lb facs="P38_TL00035"/>Some have supposed that the jealousy of Italian husbands gave rise to the invention<lb facs="P38_TL00036"/>of the chopine. Lirnojon de Saint Didier, a lively French writer on the republic of Venice,<lb facs="P38_TL00037"/>mentions a conversation with some of the Doge ' s counsellors of state on this subject, in<lb facs="P38_TL00038"/>which it was remarked that smaller shoes would certainly be found more convenient; which<lb facs="P38_TL00039"/>induced one of the counsellors to say, putting on at the same time a very austere look,<lb facs="P38_TL00040"/>" pur troppo commodi, pur troppo." (i) The first ladies who rejected the use of the chopine<lb facs="P38_TL00041"/>were the daughters of the Doge Dominico Contareno, about the year 1670. It was impossible<lb facs="P38_TL00042"/>to set one foot before the other without leaning on the shouldets of two waiting women,<lb facs="P38_TL00043"/>and those who used them must have stalked along like boys on stilts. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P38_TL00044"/>The choppine or some kind of high shoe was occasionally used in England. Bulwer in his<lb facs="P38_TL00045"/>"Artificial changling" p 550, complains of this fashion as a monstrous affectation, and says<lb facs="P38_TL00046"/>that his countrywomen therein imitated the Venetian and Persian ladies. In Sandys' s<lb facs="P38_TL00047"/>travels, 1615, there is a figure of a Turkish lady with chopines; and it is not improbable<lb facs="P38_TL00048"/>that the Venetians might have borrowed them from the Greek islands in the Archipelago.<lb facs="P38_TL00049"/>We know that something similar was in use among the ancient Greeks. Xenophon in<lb facs="P38_TL00050"/>his ceconomics, introduced the wife of Ischomachus, as having high shoes for the purpose<lb facs="P38_TL00051"/>of increasing her stature. They are still worn by the women in many parts of Turkey, but<lb facs="P38_TL00052"/>more particularly at Aleppo. As the figure of an object is often better than twenty pages<lb facs="P38_TL00053"/>of description, one is here given from a real Venetian chopine. &amp; &amp; </ab>

For example, conceive the sound of drums beaten with rods and of triangles hurled at<lb facs="P39_TL00027"/>gongs. Both these 44 effects" the German Doctor has introduced into his " Elektra ". The<lb facs="P39_TL00028"/>sound of every animal Is also reproduced; the cracking of whips on the backs of slaves, the<lb facs="P39_TL00029"/>shrieks of the tortured, the blows of a hatchet upon human flesh, all these noises belch<lb facs="P39_TL00030"/>out from the orchestra, the orchestra of Strauss,.... and cause the beholder at the Opera<lb facs="P39_TL00031"/>no fear whatever. But think what they might be on the field of battle I jS? 45? j£?<lb facs="P39_TL00032"/>j£? Of course Strauss believes that his sounds strike terror, but I ask him for one evening,<lb facs="P39_TL00033"/>instead of looking at his score, to turn his eyes towards the audience. He will find them<lb facs="P39_TL00034"/>shivering with pleasure. What a wise man you are, Doctor, not to have anticipated all this<lb facs="P39_TL00035"/>before you began! You tell yourself that you are moving your audience as in the old days<lb facs="P39_TL00036"/>Aeschylus moved his audience, but you forget that the conditions are quite different. All<lb facs="P39_TL00037"/>you do is to amaze and to amuse. Nobody was ever anything but amused or amazed by<lb facs="P39_TL00038"/>the comic entertainer who gives imitations of natural sounds. I remember a man who used to be<lb facs="P39_TL00039"/>able to imitate a pig by shutting one eye and blowing out of one nostril. He brought the house<lb facs="P39_TL00040"/>down just as you probably will this year at Covent Garden. It is just a trick like anything<lb facs="P39_TL00041"/>else, even as all art is a trick or as eating your breakfast is a trick; but a trick should be<lb facs="P39_TL00042"/>charmingly done, and should be recognised as a trick, done stylishly. jg? £? 45?<lb facs="P39_TL00043"/>I could almost swear, judging from 44 Elektra, " that you bolt your food, Doctor; that<lb facs="P39_TL00044"/>you eat alone, that you grumble that the food is cold while worrying about these life<lb facs="P39_TL00045"/>problems which really do not concern you and which you are quite unable to solve.<lb facs="P39_TL00046"/>45? It is only when a man bolts his food that he returns to the Murder of Agamemnon as a<lb facs="P39_TL00047"/>theme upon which to write a modern opera. Now what the murder of Agamemnon has to<lb facs="P39_TL00048"/>do with you, Doctor, God only knows. You know perfectly well that it has nothing to do<lb facs="P39_TL00049"/>with anybody today. I grant you that it is a theme for a military band and it is all the<lb facs="P39_TL00050"/>more strange that His Imperial Highness the German Emperor is so critical about your<lb facs="P39_TL00051"/>music, for it seems the very thing for him ! He is the one man on earth who could put it to<lb facs="P39_TL00052"/>its right use. Perhaps he fears that it would occupy so many fighting men ' s time that<lb facs="P39_TL00053"/>there would be none over to do the shooting, but I dare say you could settle that be<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

                                    <lb facs="P40_TL00004"/>\yhat is it which distinguishes a great man ? I am always wanting to see a great man,<lb facs="P40_TL00005"/>but somehow very few are to be found. Is a great writer a great man? Can he be a great<lb facs="P40_TL00006"/>writer unless he is a great man ? It has never been ciearly stated what constitutes a great man<lb facs="P40_TL00007"/>and I do not propose to attempt the solution of the problem here. But I have been set<lb facs="P40_TL00008"/>thinking about all this by reading about M. Maeterlinck. £? &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P40_TL00009"/>He writes for the theatre, although, so far as I know, he has no special friendship for<lb facs="P40_TL00010"/>the theatre I mean this poor old dilapidated modern theatre and I am a little<lb facs="P40_TL00011"/>bit surprised at this. To embrace the theatre for what it is or to reproach the theatre for<lb facs="P40_TL00012"/>what it is not, either of these attitudes denotes affection for it; but to treat it with indif<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P40_TL00013"/>ference seems to me unworthy in a man who uses the theatre for his own purposes.<lb facs="P40_TL00014"/>&amp; Again, the theatre concerns itself with ceremony. The essence of the theatre is ceremony,<lb facs="P40_TL00015"/>yet one finds M. Maeterlinck frightened to death of ceremony. He writes to a friend in<lb facs="P40_TL00016"/>Brussels who has invited him to dinner that he will accept 44 On condition that you receive<lb facs="P40_TL00017"/>me with absolute simplicity. Every sort of ceremony dismaj s me; I am a peasant".<lb facs="P40_TL00018"/>This is all the more curious because we know that if there is a thing that pleases a<lb facs="P40_TL00019"/>peasant it is ceremony; if there is a thing which pleases the open=&gt;alr man it is ceremony.<lb facs="P40_TL00020"/>As for the theatre, they adore it; so M. Maeterlinck cannot be a peasant because he has<lb facs="P40_TL00021"/>the whole country side against him on this score. The peasants are by no means dismayed<lb facs="P40_TL00022"/>by the theatre or by the village procession or by the courteous and distinguished gathe<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P40_TL00023"/>rings in which they delight. Nothing that I can think of can be more ceremonious and<lb facs="P40_TL00024"/>show a better sense of fine ceremony than fie peasant. Thus this claiming to be a peasant on<lb facs="P40_TL00025"/>M. Maeterlinck's part is a little affectation. Perhaps it is also affectation, this pretended<lb facs="P40_TL00026"/>disregard for the theatre.<lb facs="P40_TL00027"/>&amp; And M. Maeterlinck pretends to hate interviews. Writing to a friend he says, 44 / be~<lb facs="P40_TL00028"/>seech you in all sincerity, in all sincerity, if you can prevent the interviews of which you<lb facs="P40_TL00029"/>speak, for the love of God do it I I begin to be frightfully weary of it all. Yesterday, while<lb facs="P40_TL00030"/>I was dining, two reporters tumbled into my soup". &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P40_TL00031"/>Now for my part I can think of nothing nicer than to spend half an hour conversing with<lb facs="P40_TL00032"/>two gentlemen who have undertaken the very difficult task of writing reviews for a<lb facs="P40_TL00033"/>journal.... reviews of the great, reviews of the middle sized, and reviews of the small <lb facs="P40_TL00034"/>and should I happen to be at dinner when an interviewer called on me what could be a<lb facs="P40_TL00035"/>greater pleasure for me than to offer him a seat at my table ? There is always something<lb facs="P40_TL00036"/>to be said to those good fellows and if one does not speak of symbolism to children they<lb facs="P40_TL00037"/>are none the less welcome at the table. &amp;<lb facs="P40_TL00038"/>&amp; I wonder If a really great man would have written about ceremony and interviewers as<lb facs="P40_TL00039"/>M.Maeterlinck has done? I am almost of the opinion that had Socrates let himself get into<lb facs="P40_TL00040"/>the position of M. Maeterlinck by writing plays appealing to the public at large he would<lb facs="P40_TL00041"/>have received interviewers without grumbling and would have known exactly what to say<lb facs="P40_TL00042"/>to them. There are many people who object to receiving interviewers, but if it is conside<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P40_TL00043"/>red for a moment, what is there against the interviewer? What awful crime has he com<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P40_TL00044"/>mitted that he is to be treated like an outcast ? On the other hand we find that all the<lb facs="P40_TL00045"/>great men do not treat this excellent servant of the public in this way. For instance there<lb facs="P40_TL00046"/>is Walt Whitman and there is Mark Twain, and neither has manifested an unhealthy fear<lb facs="P40_TL00047"/>of the interviewer, and yet I should say that Walt Whitman was far more of a peasant<lb facs="P40_TL00048"/>than Maeterlinck, and a real adorer of the theatre &amp; ■£? &amp;<lb facs="P40_TL00049"/>&amp; Although M. Maeterlinck has set me thinking as to what a great man might be, I cannot<lb facs="P40_TL00050"/>come anywhere nearer by thinking of his attitude towards those two things, the theatre<lb facs="P40_TL00051"/>and ceremony. He does not help me to a conclusion. &lt;&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P40_TL00052"/>&amp; In his writings he aims to be simple; in his life he is affected while he continues to lay<lb facs="P40_TL00053"/>such stress upon being a simple peasant who hates ceremony and Ignores the theatre; for,<lb facs="P40_TL00054"/>while he professes this hatred and this indifference, he yet makes a reputation and a fat<lb facs="P40_TL00055"/>income from the theatre, and strives year after year to write more, not less, actable plays.</ab>

Beerbohm Tree. The writer of the article begs our artists<lb facs="P41_TL00007"/>to " give us a touch of the joie de vivre " and is puzzled to understand how it is that<lb facs="P41_TL00008"/>this joie is absent from our art.<lb facs="P41_TL00009"/>I have read his carefully written article carefully, it is excellently done; it Is very<lb facs="P41_TL00010"/>tolerantly and very clearly written; he tries to find excuses for the artist, and he finds<lb facs="P41_TL00011"/>plenty, but they are the wrong ones. In fact excuses are not needed. Explanation he cannot<lb facs="P41_TL00012"/>give because he is in a puzzled condition. He cannot understand why the artists of today<lb facs="P41_TL00013"/>avoid the martyrdom which all artists who have expressed true joie de vivre have<lb facs="P41_TL00014"/>undergone at the hands of the English public and critics and public servants. &lt;£&gt;<lb facs="P41_TL00015"/>I have not the pleasure of knowing Mr Galsworthy' s work; but that he cautiously avoids<lb facs="P41_TL00016"/>the path taken by Shelley, William Blake, Keats, Byron and Chatterton is not surprising. 1<lb facs="P41_TL00017"/>am not writing a second 44 Book of Martyrs " or I should complete the list, with full details<lb facs="P41_TL00018"/>added of each individual torture, but readers of this note will easily call to mind the<lb facs="P41_TL00019"/>indignities which these men whom I have named were called upon to suffer in the cause<lb facs="P41_TL00020"/>of the Joy of Life.^<lb facs="P41_TL00021"/>&amp; The writer in 44 The Times " is none the less right when he says that 44 art that does<lb facs="P41_TL00022"/>44 not express the Joy of Life in some way, with some exultation of laughter or tears, is not<lb facs="P41_TL00023"/>44 art at all, and in sacrificing everything to truth, tells a lie." 3 have noticed that most of<lb facs="P41_TL00024"/>the writers in "The Mask" have said this again and again. &lt;£?<lb facs="P41_TL00025"/>&amp; But what would you have in England ? England, the freshest sweetest land<lb facs="P41_TL00026"/>on earth is the victim of Fog. The very buttercups and daisies themselves are dying out,<lb facs="P41_TL00027"/>for nobody notices them.

Then the second thing that Mr. Graham<lb facs="P44_TL00078"/>Robertson is guilty of Is actually copying<lb facs="P44_TL00079"/>the type of book cover which the other young<lb facs="P44_TL00080"/>fellow would have been sure to have avoided.<lb facs="P44_TL00081"/>The cloth is a sickly kind of bluegreen. <lb facs="P44_TL00082"/>The third thing that Mr. Robertson does<lb facs="P44_TL00083"/>is to forget to apologize for it. He lets the<lb facs="P44_TL00084"/>awful thing go out to the public without a<lb facs="P44_TL00085"/>word of regret. &amp;<lb facs="P44_TL00086"/>Heaven knows how many thousands a<lb facs="P44_TL00087"/>year Mr. Graham Robertson is credited with,<lb facs="P44_TL00088"/>but it seems hardly any excuse for acting in<lb facs="P44_TL00089"/>such a manner.<lb facs="P44_TL00090"/>JZ?

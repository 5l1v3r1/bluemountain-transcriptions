Nor should we omit<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>to call attention to the profit derivable from the occasional letting of the Theatre in the<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>evening for concerts, lectures, &amp;c.

As no play, however attractive, would be<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>repeated any number of days consecutively, the same principal performers would not be<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>called upon to appear more than twice or three times in the week.

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>tragical imitation of the ancients was altogether ideal and rythmical; and in forming<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>a judgement of It, we must always keep this in view. It was ideal, in so far as it aimed<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>at the highest grace and dignity; and rythmical, insomuch as the gestures and inflections<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>of voice were more solemnly measured than in real life.<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>As the statuary of the Greeks, setting out, with almost scientific strictness, with the<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>most general conception, sought to embody it again in various general characters which<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>were gradually invested with the charms of life, so that the individual was the last thing<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>to which they descended ; in like manner in the mimetic art, they began with the idea<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>(the delineation of persons with heroical grandeur, more than human dignity, and ideal<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>beauty,) then passed to character, and made passion the last of all; which, in the collision<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>with the requisitions of either of the others, was forced to give way.<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>&amp; Fidelity of representation was less their object than beauty; with us it is exactly the<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>reverse. On this principle, the use of masks, which appears astonishing to us, was not only<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>justifiable, but absolutely essential; far from considering them as a makeshift, the Greeks<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>would certainly, and with justice too, have looked upon it as a makeshift to be obliged<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>to allow a player with vulgar, ignoble, or strongly marked features, to represent an Apollo<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>or a Hercules; nay, rather they would have deemed it downright profanation. &amp; &amp;</ab>

The difference fn date between the two stories is only a very few years.<lb facs="P33_TL00012"/>Indeed Antony and Cleopatra may be taken as a continuation of Julius Caesar.<lb facs="P33_TL00013"/>The latter play ended with the fall of Brutus at the battle of Philippi, B. C. 42.<lb facs="P33_TL00014"/>The other tragedy begins with the death of Fulvia, B. C. 40, and concludes with the<lb facs="P33_TL00015"/>death of Kleopatra B. C. 30. The last of the Ptolemies, passionate and animal as she was,<lb facs="P33_TL00016"/>seems to have been no worse than were many members of her distinguished family before<lb facs="P33_TL00017"/>her. The legitimate dynasty became extinct on the death of Ptolemy Alexander II. But<lb facs="P33_TL00018"/>Alexander had a natural brother‚Äîone Dionysius Auletes‚Äîwho, after much trouble, secured<lb facs="P33_TL00019"/>for himself the throne of Egypt, leaving it to his eldest child‚Äîthe Kleopatra of the drama<lb facs="P33_TL00020"/>‚Äîwho was born B. C. 68. There had been already four generations of Kleopatras. The first<lb facs="P33_TL00021"/>was a Syrian princess, who was married to Ptolemy Epiphanes, and who bore him two sons<lb facs="P33_TL00022"/>and two daughters, both of the latter being named after their mother. One of these girls<lb facs="P33_TL00023"/>was taken to wife by her brothers in succession, and had a family by each, the eldest son<lb facs="P33_TL00024"/>of the youngest brother being Ptolemy Soter II., the grandfather of our Kleopatra. JZ?<lb facs="P33_TL00025"/>&amp; In the tragedy before us we have no less than thirty=six scenes. Of these twenty=five<lb facs="P33_TL00026"/>are architectural, including the one on board Pompey's galley, which belongs to naval<lb facs="P33_TL00027"/>architecture. The other twenty=four are divided between Alexandria, Rome, Messina, and<lb facs="P33_TL00028"/>Athens, or the respective residences of Kleopatra, Caeesar, Pompeius, and Antonius, but by<lb facs="P33_TL00029"/>far the most important of these are those which belong to the City of the Ptolemies. It<lb facs="P33_TL00030"/>is next to impossible to reduce this play to set scenes, for the unities of time and place<lb facs="P33_TL00031"/>are quite disregarded by the author. In the first and last Acts a very slight change would<lb facs="P33_TL00032"/>enable us to bring these into two scenes, if the fourth Scene of the first Act were carried<lb facs="P33_TL00033"/>on to the second Act and the first Scene of the fifth Act omitted, but the second Act car=<lb facs="P33_TL00034"/>ries us in seven scenes from Pompey's house at Messina to the house of Tepidus at Rome,<lb facs="P33_TL00035"/>thence into Caesar's palace, thence into the streets of Rome, thence to the palace at<lb facs="P33_TL00036"/>Alexandria, thence to Misenum, and finally leaves us floating on the sea. In the third Act<lb facs="P33_TL00037"/>(eleven scenes) we are in Alexandria, Rome and Athens; now on the plains of Syria, and<lb facs="P33_TL00038"/>now on the promontory of Actium. In the fourth Act of thirteen scenes we are certainly<lb facs="P33_TL00039"/>confined to Alexandria and its neighbourhood, but we are perpetually moved about from<lb facs="P33_TL00040"/>the inside of the palace to the outside, from within to without the walls, from one camp<lb facs="P33_TL00041"/>to the other, until we are brought to rest in that remarkable scene‚Äî44 the monument". I<lb facs="P33_TL00042"/>see no reason why the scene in the house of Lepidus (Act ii., Scene 2) should not be laid<lb facs="P33_TL00043"/>in a lesche or under a colonnade before Caesar's house, and thus serve also for the two<lb facs="P33_TL00044"/>scenes which follow it. Indeed, by the exercise of some little thought and care, the whole<lb facs="P33_TL00045"/>number of the architectural scenes may be fairly reduced, and it is possible without serious<lb facs="P33_TL00046"/>mutilation to prevent some of the abrupt changes, as for example that brought about by<lb facs="P33_TL00047"/>the introduction of Alexandria in the fifth Scene of the second Act; for there does not<lb facs="P33_TL00048"/>exist, as it seems to me, any great obstacle to this scene forming part of the third in the<lb facs="P33_TL00049"/>third Act. 1 cannot at present see that we can do with less architectural scenery than<lb facs="P33_TL00050"/>that set down in the following list, unless the scenes at Athens and Messina are omitted<lb facs="P33_TL00051"/>altogether;‚Äî 1.

The temples and palace,<lb facs="P34_TL00007"/>however, that I have just mentioned must be held to be far inferior to the temples and<lb facs="P34_TL00008"/>palace of the royal city.

                                    <lb facs="P34_TL00017"/>tiphilus and Apelles were by no means remarkable men; a city where the Aryan and the<lb facs="P34_TL00018"/>Semitic nations were united, where the Egyptian, the Jew, and the Greek met, as it were<lb facs="P34_TL00019"/>on a level platform‚Äîwas not a place where architecture or any other art would be likely<lb facs="P34_TL00020"/>to be underrated. The picturesque irregularity visible in the work at Philse must not,<lb facs="P34_TL00021"/>however, be taken as applicable to the palace of the Ptolemies at Alexandria. That the<lb facs="P34_TL00022"/>spirit of Greek freedom that freedom without which the Propylea would never have been<lb facs="P34_TL00023"/>‚Äîmight have struck root in Alexandria is more than probable, but the day of freedom, of<lb facs="P34_TL00024"/>original art-thought was already far spent; law was taking the place of feeling; geometry<lb facs="P34_TL00025"/>was being substituted for the eye; instead of ideas being created facts were collated ; the<lb facs="P34_TL00026"/>beautiful was reduced to a system, and art was made science. The evidence of material<lb facs="P34_TL00027"/>wealth‚Äîa splendour lavish as daylight‚Äîwould be there. Whatever marble and basalt,<lb facs="P34_TL00028"/>poiphyry and serpentine, bronze or silver, or gold, or any other precious material could do<lb facs="P34_TL00029"/>we may be quite sure was not lacking. Mechanics would shine like the sun in construction;<lb facs="P34_TL00030"/>multitudes of pillars, and miles of avenue, and corridor, and labyrinth would speak of the<lb facs="P34_TL00031"/>mighty mass of labour in the service of Egypt; but the creative art power had passed its<lb facs="P34_TL00032"/>meridian a full century before the city was founded, and quite two centuries before the<lb facs="P34_TL00033"/>Ptolemies began the objectionable practice of marrying their own sisters. (2) j¬Æ<lb facs="P34_TL00034"/>&amp; The " monument " of the play is evidently nothing more than the raised stage at the<lb facs="P34_TL00035"/>back of the main stage, so common in the theatres of Shakspere's time. An Egyptian mo<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P34_TL00036"/>nument or tomb was constructed on principles which could not possibly admit the poet's<lb facs="P34_TL00037"/>Idea. But the Greek monument was altogether different. In the one case we find a tomb,<lb facs="P34_TL00038"/>an architectural grave, a sepulchre; in the other we have a house, a shrine, a temple. The<lb facs="P34_TL00039"/>little memorial of Lysicrates at Athens, and the temple-like Lycian monument discovered<lb facs="P34_TL00040"/>at Xanthus, and now in our National Museum, are extreme illustrations of one principle of<lb facs="P34_TL00041"/>design. In both the structure consists of two storeys; the ground storey solid and com<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P34_TL00042"/>paratively plain, the upper storey open and enriched with columns, figure sculpture, and<lb facs="P34_TL00043"/>other ornamental accessories. Now, although acting on a higher platform than the stage<lb facs="P34_TL00044"/>is always made to look more or less ridiculous by modern scenic arrangements, in proof of<lb facs="P34_TL00045"/>which assertion I may cite Juliet's balcony as a flagrant example, and although I know of<lb facs="P34_TL00046"/>no instance where this division of stage level has been well carried out, yet even in the<lb facs="P34_TL00047"/>Veronese and Venetian plays there is no room for reasonable excuse if the scene results in<lb facs="P34_TL00048"/>failure; still less In the play under consideration should the acting suffer, inasmuch as the<lb facs="P34_TL00049"/>area of the monument of Egypt's Queen may be of almost any size. In its architecture, as<lb facs="P34_TL00050"/>compared with that of the palace, there might well be marked the vast difference between<lb facs="P34_TL00051"/>the arts under the first Ptolemies, when the Aphrodite Anadyomene was painted, and<lb facs="P34_TL00052"/>the low condition to which a hundred and fifty years of rapid decline had brought them,<lb facs="P34_TL00053"/>when the last of the Macedonian dynasty ascended the throne. J¬Æ &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P34_TL00054"/>j¬Æ Our third Scene-Caesar's house at Rome‚Äîneeds no further description than what has<lb facs="P34_TL00055"/>already been given in the notes on Julius C¬Æsar. Antony's house at Athens might be one</ab>

The fourth and fifth Scenes of the third Act<lb facs="P35_TL00009"/>introduce us to two rooms in this house, but there is no reason why one interior should<lb facs="P35_TL00010"/>not suffice for both Scenes, if the proper room be selected, which I take it should be the<lb facs="P35_TL00011"/>pillared hall (iiAv) of the Andronitis, which in a Greek house occupies the place of the<lb facs="P35_TL00012"/>Roman Atrium.

That the Roman<lb facs="P35_TL00019"/>fashions were for the most part accepted wherever the power of Rome had made itself a<lb facs="P35_TL00020"/>reality may be safely assumed, but then these fashions were themselves moulded on those<lb facs="P35_TL00021"/>of other nations. Nor was this spirit of Imitation or copyism altogether confined to the<lb facs="P35_TL00022"/>people by the banks of the Tiber. It is said of the great Alexander that, after his Persian<lb facs="P35_TL00023"/>conquests, becoming partial to some of the things he saw in Asia, and desiring to make<lb facs="P35_TL00024"/>himself popular with his new subjects, he actually assumed the Persian habit and adopted<lb facs="P35_TL00025"/>many of their customs. Everyone knows that the Romans followed his example in regard<lb facs="P35_TL00026"/>to Greece with a sort of alacrity which was at times almost amusing. But fashion, in old<lb facs="P35_TL00027"/>as In modern times belongs to the upper classes, so that while I have little hesitation in<lb facs="P35_TL00028"/>clothing Kleopatra and her court in the habit, or some slight modification of the habit<lb facs="P35_TL00029"/>prevalent among Greeks more or less adopted also by the Roman aristocracy‚Äîthe poor<lb facs="P35_TL00030"/>people, the clown especially, and perhaps the soothsayer, might very well exhibit In<lb facs="P35_TL00031"/>their dress some tradition of the old nation to which they belonged. (1) The Ionic chiton, the<lb facs="P35_TL00032"/>chlamys, the peplos, the transparent fine linen vest, chemise, or under tunic were dresses<lb facs="P35_TL00033"/>which obtained throughout the shores of the Mediterranean with but little variation beyond<lb facs="P35_TL00034"/>that resulting from increase or decrease in length or breadth of material. No doubt, too*<lb facs="P35_TL00035"/>the fashionable ladies of Alexandria had their parasols or umbracula just the same as the<lb facs="P35_TL00036"/>ladies of Athens, Rome or Pompeii. Broad-brimmed straw hats, with low, saucershaped<lb facs="P35_TL00037"/>crowns, were also probably worn. Octavla, after her marriage, might appear in the stola<lb facs="P35_TL00038"/>and the square-cut white pallium, fastened with a fibula or brooch on the right shoulder,<lb facs="P35_TL00039"/>leaving the right arm free. For the details of the costume for this play it will be sufficient<lb facs="P35_TL00040"/>to refer to the marbles and bronzes in the British Museum. Among the references to<lb facs="P35_TL00041"/>costume In the text of (1) Julius Caesar and (2) Antony and Cleopatra we find mention made<lb facs="P35_TL00042"/>of (1) leather aprons, crowns, coronets, doublets, cloaks, kerchiefs, nightgowns, dressing<lb facs="P35_TL00043"/>gowns, with pockets, spurs; (2) the points of a doublet, crowns, crownets," and pockets.<lb facs="P35_TL00044"/>In Julius Caesar the architectural passages are few and slight‚Äî &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P35_TL00045"/>Many a time and oft<lb facs="P35_TL00046"/>Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,<lb facs="P35_TL00047"/>To towers and windows, yea to chimney-tops,<lb facs="P35_TL00048"/>&amp;c., &amp;c.<lb facs="P35_TL00049"/>Mention Is also made of stone towers and walls of beaten brass, and there are references<lb facs="P35_TL00050"/>to buildings and places in Rome, e.g., Pompey's porch, Pompey's theatre, the statues of<lb facs="P35_TL00051"/>Old Brutus and Pompey, images decked with ceremonies or hung with trophies, public<lb facs="P35_TL00052"/>pulpits, and Caesar's walks, arbours, and orchards. In Antony and Cleopatra there is not<lb facs="P35_TL00053"/>one word about architecture or building, but then we have a description of the Queen's<lb facs="P35_TL00054"/>barge, which was all overlaid with gold and " like a burnish'd throne burnt on the water;"<lb facs="P35_TL00055"/>its poop was of beaten or repousse gold, its sails were purple and perfumed, the tackle of<lb facs="P35_TL00056"/>silk, the oars of silver, and the pavilion or canopy or dais which shadowed the rare Egyptian<lb facs="P35_TL00057"/>was cloth of gold of tissue. If a throne was wanted in the market-place for the serpent of<lb facs="P35_TL00058"/>old Nile and her lover, it was got by setting chairs of gold upon a platform of silver "a<lb facs="P35_TL00059"/>tribunal silver'd " .

As to his palace, though<lb facs="P36_TL00030"/>the walls are finely painted, there is scarcely one room<lb facs="P36_TL00031"/>that he can comfortably sit down in, for the apartments<lb facs="P36_TL00032"/>are usually as barren of furniture as if a distress for rent<lb facs="P36_TL00033"/>had recently cleared them.

Village festivities are also of a very mild description<lb facs="P38_TL00028"/>in their theatrical form, and comprise little more than the luxury of sitting on a bench<lb facs="P38_TL00029"/>outside an alehouse door, holding in one hand a tin cup filled up above the brim with<lb facs="P38_TL00030"/>wool, which is occasionally raised to the lips, in accordance with some complimentary<lb facs="P38_TL00031"/>allusion to John Barleycorn<lb facs="P38_TL00032"/>To return, however, to the costume of the stage countryman. The remainder is made<lb facs="P38_TL00033"/>up of a red wig and a hooked stick, with a small bundle slung across it, and a pair of<lb facs="P38_TL00034"/>dancing-pumps, in which he is always prepared to walk to London, for the purpose of<lb facs="P38_TL00035"/>righting 44 poor sisther Phoebe, " or telling the 44 great squire " that he (the stage countryman)<lb facs="P38_TL00036"/>has got 44 feelins like, " and that he (the stage countryman) is as good a 44 mon " as he<lb facs="P38_TL00037"/>(the squire): 44thof he (the squire) have gotten a fine coat on his back "... .a home truth<lb facs="P38_TL00038"/>which sometimes throws the squire into a state of pitiable penitence about something or<lb facs="P38_TL00039"/>other which there is no proof of his having been guilty of. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P38_TL00040"/>Though the dramatic rustic is vividly alive to any wrong, real or imaginary, inflicted<lb facs="P38_TL00041"/>on his own sister, he is often, as far as his own treatment of the fair sex is concerned,<lb facs="P38_TL00042"/>little better than a domestic ruffian.

                                    <lb facs="P41_TL00008"/>English Drawl has come to stay till the End. It was once a jovial gutteral drawl;<lb facs="P41_TL00009"/>it now affects the lips rather than the throat. It has taken its change for the worse. It<lb facs="P41_TL00010"/>swaggered once; now it simpers. I do not know the names of all the separate English<lb facs="P41_TL00011"/>Drawls but I have heard of something called the Oxford Drawl and I have heard of the<lb facs="P41_TL00012"/>Piccadilly Drawl. I suppose there must be also the Winchester Drawl and the Cavendish<lb facs="P41_TL00013"/>Square Drawl, but about the really very famous Drawls only an expert could tell us. ¬£?<lb facs="P41_TL00014"/>There are, however, others; those which, so far as I know, have not yet made names for<lb facs="P41_TL00015"/>themselves. Their echo is to be heard in the journals and we may label them.<lb facs="P41_TL00016"/>&lt;¬£? For instance, the " Saturday Review Drawl." A clear voice is heard for several pages<lb facs="P41_TL00017"/>and then the drawl,... a bored drawl... the drawl of the wise " Max. " I say wise<lb facs="P41_TL00018"/>advisedly. His is above all things a drawl of spiritual surrender, of elasticity it swears<lb facs="P41_TL00019"/>it will not shout. &amp;<lb facs="P41_TL00020"/>Readers must not find anything silly about this drawl. Whatever it is it is not silly;<lb facs="P41_TL00021"/>In fact, when we hear it the speaker stands revealed: we feel we are in the presence<lb facs="P41_TL00022"/>of a truly wise man: nobility, reverence, modesty and courage, all these we feel are behind<lb facs="P41_TL00023"/>that drawl: it compels us, I mean all of us who are not fools.<lb facs="P41_TL00024"/>This drawl is a pure English drawl acquired after enormous pains, and the greater the<lb facs="P41_TL00025"/>credit to its owner since its owner is not entirely English. Would an Italian ever have had<lb facs="P41_TL00026"/>the power to make himself master of this thing ? No! Would a Frenchman have<lb facs="P41_TL00027"/>dared ? No, a thousand times, No I Only one from the Fatherland could have so dared<lb facs="P41_TL00028"/>and done.j¬£&gt;<lb facs="P41_TL00029"/>As 1 have hinted, behind this drawl is a divine voice; it has something to say and it<lb facs="P41_TL00030"/>says it regularly every Saturday.<lb facs="P41_TL00031"/>" Max " has a reputation for being never dull What is his secret ? .... it is in being<lb facs="P41_TL00032"/>very very wise. Such kindly wisdom too, suppressing any ignorance under a pretence of<lb facs="P41_TL00033"/>not knowing detesting emphasis,.... admiring all that is elegant and admirable; a tolerant<lb facs="P41_TL00034"/>wisdom; one never yet known to praise that which it could not understand. This it is to be<lb facs="P41_TL00035"/>entirely wise,... profound. Yet I have always heard of the "witty" Max, the "clever"<lb facs="P41_TL00036"/>Max. As though mere wit and cleverness masqueraded under a drawl. Why, it will be said<lb facs="P41_TL00037"/>next that affectation is hid beneath a lisp! 4? &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P41_TL00038"/>&amp; Surely Max' s is the true English voice. Was it not a voice of this calibre that was heard<lb facs="P41_TL00039"/>on the day when the Armada was sighted ,... " Ohhh.... Indeed in siiight you<lb facs="P41_TL00040"/>saaay ?....

And such costume serves<lb facs="P42_TL00015"/>them in the governments, embassies and in the tribunals as evidence that they are serious<lb facs="P42_TL00016"/>persons and of mature judgment. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P42_TL00017"/>young men in love, (giovani innamorati) usually wear a doublet of satin, tabby or<lb facs="P42_TL00018"/>other silk, pointed or slashed with various patterns in the form of crosses or stars,<lb facs="P42_TL00019"/>through which slashes the coloured linings of taffetas are seen. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P42_TL00020"/>They wear with the said doublet buttons of gold, and at the neck frills with clean lace,<lb facs="P42_TL00021"/>and on the head a cap of rich velvet or silk brocade with a scarf round it, gathered in front<lb facs="P42_TL00022"/>into the form of a rose, where they usually set some little medallion.<lb facs="P42_TL00023"/>They generally have their small clothes of the same stuff, and embroidered silk stockings<lb facs="P42_TL00024"/>with shoes of Spanish morocco, and over all they wear a cappetto, (a cloak with a hood<lb facs="P42_TL00025"/>of silk brocade, a flower in one hand and in the other their handkerchief and their<lb facs="P42_TL00026"/>gloves.<lb facs="P42_TL00027"/>&amp; This costume is much used by nobles, alike in Venice and the other cities of Italy,<lb facs="P42_TL00028"/>especially by the youths before they don the robes with elbow sleeves which, until eighteen<lb facs="P42_TL00029"/>or twenty years of age, they do not wear. Thus the greater number wear the costume<lb facs="P42_TL00030"/>here described. But many however wear it in black, others In silver or light purple,<lb facs="P42_TL00031"/>especially the doublet and small clothes and hose as seen in the picture.^<lb facs="P42_TL00032"/>peasants who come to Venice at the season of All Saints to sell geese, eggs and other<lb facs="P42_TL00033"/>food wear the costume here shown, which consists of a hat of coarse straw on the head<lb facs="P42_TL00034"/>and a garment reaching halfway to the knee made of roan coloured cloth or of herrettino<lb facs="P42_TL00035"/>or fratesco, and on their feet shoes of undressed leather against the mud, and to their<lb facs="P42_TL00036"/>legs they fasten certain high gaiters of leather; over their frock they put a cloak of roan<lb facs="P42_TL00037"/>cloth or coarse herrettino, of little value, with a wide collar which falls over the cloak as<lb facs="P42_TL00038"/>far as the shoulders, and they hold, resting upon the ground, a staff with a goose or two.<lb facs="P42_TL00039"/>'Jphe costume here shown is of certain women peasants who come on Saturday to the<lb facs="P42_TL00040"/>market in Venice from the villages of the surrounding parts, the which women, when<lb facs="P42_TL00041"/>they enter the city, take off a large wide hat which outside they wear on their heads, and<lb facs="P42_TL00042"/>carry it in their hands. This hat is made of coarse straw with a band of red or crimson silk<lb facs="P42_TL00043"/>round it.<lb facs="P42_TL00044"/>They wear an upper dress of another stuff, blue in colour, or hiano, with a rather tight<lb facs="P42_TL00045"/>corset, which they lace with little silken cords, somewhat loosely so that one sees the white<lb facs="P42_TL00046"/>chemisette beneath; and on this corset they wear medallions of gilded silver, and wrapped<lb facs="P42_TL00047"/>around the head and neck they have a white veil of cotton or other stuff which serves also<lb facs="P42_TL00048"/>to keep their hair in order. And because they come from outside where there is much mud<lb facs="P42_TL00049"/>they fasten up the said dress with a leather belt three fingers wide a handsbreadth from<lb facs="P42_TL00050"/>the ground over another underskirt which they wear; and they carry on their shoulders<lb facs="P42_TL00051"/>two baskets with chickens and hens in one, and in the other cheese and eggs and fruit and<lb facs="P42_TL00052"/>every kind of thing which is produced at the villas.

But now it seems that he is really in earnest in his desire to advance<lb facs="P63_TL00008"/>the art about which he talks so much, for, through the columns of the Daily Mail of June<lb facs="P63_TL00009"/>5th he has made a statement which does him great credit.<lb facs="P63_TL00010"/>&amp; "1 WANT," he says, "TO DO FOR THE THEATRE IN ENGLAND WHAT THE DAILY<lb facs="P63_TL00011"/>MAIL HAS DONE FOR AIRMANSHIP. NATURALLY IT WILL COST MONEY ".<lb facs="P63_TL00012"/>&amp; Now we all know what the Daily Mali is doing and has done for airmanship. It has<lb facs="P63_TL00013"/>given an incalculable Impetus to the development of flying machines, quickened the energies<lb facs="P63_TL00014"/>and fired the courage of flying men not only in England but all over Europe, and facilitated<lb facs="P63_TL00015"/>their studies. And it has cost the Daily Alall more than L. 10,000.0.0 and Will cost It<lb facs="P63_TL00016"/>L. 20,000.0.0. And we know what the result has been ; the flight of the Channel, the flight<lb facs="P63_TL00017"/>from London to Manchester; one obstacle after another surmounted, one great feat after<lb facs="P63_TL00018"/>another achieved.<lb facs="P63_TL00019"/>JSr And the system ? Prizes. Anybody could compete, and the best man had to win. Condi®<lb facs="P63_TL00020"/>lions not impossible.<lb facs="P63_TL00021"/>&amp; It was a fine thing which the Daily Afail did ; and now we hear that Mr Frohman<lb facs="P63_TL00022"/>proposes to follow the same method with regard to the theatre, and we can understand<lb facs="P63_TL00023"/>that all the European artists of the theatre are awaiting with keen interest the publication<lb facs="P63_TL00024"/>of details as to the kind of task to be accomplished and the prize to be awarded. By offe®<lb facs="P63_TL00025"/>ring a large sum of money, (which is obviously his intention as he compares his purpose<lb facs="P63_TL00026"/>with that of the Daily Alail), Mr Frohman will be affording the best man in the European<lb facs="P63_TL00027"/>theatre the means of continuing his studies and experiments for the future of the theatre<lb facs="P63_TL00028"/>without hindrance, and he will thus be rendering a very valuable service to the st ige. &amp;<lb facs="P63_TL00029"/>We hope before the issue of our next number to have full details of Mr Froiiman's<lb facs="P63_TL00030"/>scheme for our readers. &lt;£? jg?<lb facs="P63_TL00031"/>\ S FKFTIFKC^TOM.<lb facs="P63_TL00032"/>Chinee this was set up in type a letter has appeared in the Daily Mail from Mr Frohman<lb facs="P63_TL00033"/>in which he announces that he has not got L. 10,000.0.0 and is therefore unable to make<lb facs="P63_TL00034"/>good his own words. &amp;<lb facs="P63_TL00035"/>&amp;if the Daily MaiPs report Is correct,... and Mr Frohman has not contradicted it,.. .<lb facs="P63_TL00036"/>his words were, " I want to do for the theatre in England what the Daily Mail has done<lb facs="P63_TL00037"/>"for airmanship. NATURALLY IT WILL COST MONEY".<lb facs="P63_TL00038"/>Now when a man of Mr Frohman's capacity makes such an announcement in the Daily<lb facs="P63_TL00039"/>Mail the public Is forced to believe that he has behind him the L. 10,000.0.0 with which<lb facs="P63_TL00040"/>to do what the Daily Mai! has done for airmanship. What are we to think then when<lb facs="P63_TL00041"/>the m3n who makes the proposition afterwards writes to the same paper to say that he<lb facs="P63_TL00042"/>has not got the money with which to substantiate his declaration?<lb facs="P63_TL00043"/>jg/ He even, in his letter, (which was written in answer to one from Mr Gordon Craig<lb facs="P63_TL00044"/>asking further details of the scheme,) ignores the fact that the suggestion was his at all.<lb facs="P63_TL00045"/>With amazing modesty he credits Mr Craig with it instead, saying " I am most eager to<lb facs="P63_TL00046"/>comply with the fine suggestion made by Mr Crafg with reference to the Daily Mail air®<lb facs="P63_TL00047"/>manship prize", in justice ,to Mr Frohman we here state that the suggestion was Mr Froh®<lb facs="P63_TL00048"/>man's and was not Mr Craig's. Looking back to the original "Interview" It seems to us<lb facs="P63_TL00049"/>the cheapest way of advertising we have ever come across. <lb facs="P63_TL00050"/>if every Tom, IXck and Charley may lightly make use of this expression of " doing what<lb facs="P63_TL00051"/>the Daily Mail has done for airmanship " and then write letters to excuse himself it seems y<lb facs="P63_TL00052"/>to us to be belittling the action of the Daily Mail; and when Mr Frohman does this he is<lb facs="P63_TL00053"/>trying to dignify his own little commercial enterprises by comparisons with actions greater<lb facs="P63_TL00054"/>than he Is able to rise to. This is lowering the theatre of England. &amp;<lb facs="P63_TL00055"/>Is that what Mr Frohman wishes to do? <lb facs="P63_TL00056"/>rr.*. ttiwiMitu.i'-.ir.mavM „-;Ti» fMfmrmmrmenmm-mrmti<lb facs="P63_TL00057"/>THE MASK OFFICES.

To a person accustomed only to the<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>altar pieces of later times, and not sufficiently broad-minded to understand uncommon<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>forms of art such as this, the super-altars, with their many little compartments and figures<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>may appear as mere trifles. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>Yet if he realise that this work does not stand close to him as it seems to do, but<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>is, in fact, separated from him by four hundred years, it strikes him that these trifles<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>are not really trifles but only diminished by the perspective.

" A rich widow wanted to adopt him; but a canon sent him to<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>Paris to study, which was very convenient for the boy whose voice was just cracking, and<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>who would consequently not have been able to take female parts with the same success.<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>1he young Figaro succeeded well in the path of his studies, becoming both " master of<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>arts" and canon. &amp;&gt;&lt;&amp;&amp;&amp; jg? jg?<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>A stage such as the one on which he and his colleagues, in the golden age of the<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>Mysteries of 1450-1550, used to appear, was generally a platform, in front of which the<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>spectators' places were arranged as in an amphitheatre. The platform was at least twice<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>as long as a modern stage, and was often supplied as background with a building such as<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>a church. <lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>&amp; Why was the stage such a length? Because the drama was acted in many different places<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>and all the places were arranged in a row, side by side, like little houses with their front<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>walls removed. This long stage was never hidden by a curtain. One might compare the<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>compartments to the different sections of a modern Turntable stage, but placed in a<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>straight line instead of being grouped in a circle. Two spaces were ever the same and<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>were placed as a rule at the extreme left and the extreme right, as A and Z, Paradise and<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>Hell.<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>A great deal of fine workmanship was bestowed upon the former. Sweet, soft music behind<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>beautiful draperies and mysterious apparatuses for the flight of the angels gave a striking<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>impression of celestial bliss. The lower regions of Hell, which could be opened when<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>necessary, were filled with naked mannikins who were tortured with the most fantastic<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>instruments by the devils. The entrance to Hell took the form of the jaws of a great<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>monster. Between Heaven and Hell were the different places that might be needed in the<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>drama, such as Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Golgatha, etc. The action thus wandered from place<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>to place, the actors all being upon the stage, seated in their little houses and waiting for<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>their cue... an arrangement similar to that of the small cafe-chantants of our days, where<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>all the performers are seated on chairs against the wall of the stage and one by one step<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>forward to fulfil their parts.<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>The most popular of the Mysteries were taken from the story of the Passion and con<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Christ hung sufficiently realistically from the cross to cost the actor his life; from<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>the suspended Judas real entrails gushed out in conformity with the scriptures; indeed, the<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>theatrical mechanism was by no means to be despised. Laughter, too, sometimes afforded<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>relief after the terrors, as when St John and St Peter raced each other to the sepulchre and<lb facs="P6_TL00056"/>the holy women stood bargaining for the embalming ingredients with a Jewish apothecary,<lb facs="P6_TL00057"/>and when the latter fought with his wife. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00058"/>&lt;£* The Passion Play was generally staged with great pomp and circumstance. Old scribes<lb facs="P6_TL00059"/>in solemn oriental garments glided by, Roman soldiers in glittering armour marched on<lb facs="P6_TL00060"/>reproducing'as closely as possible those of antiquity; tumultuous crowd-effects were produced<lb facs="P6_TL00061"/>at Golgatha or Jerusalem, creating a hubbub that doubtless found a ready echo among the<lb facs="P6_TL00062"/>thousands of spectators.</ab>

The golden age<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>of these screens dates from the middle of the fifteenth century to 1540 and they were executed<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>chiefly at Brussels and Antwerp. Such things were manufactured according to the rules of<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>the Guilds, screens being carved by cabinet makers, figures by sculptors, and the gilding<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>and painting of figures and frame-work executed by painters. j® j® j®<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>j® In the Museum of Applied Art at Brussels some beautiful specimens have been collected.<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>j® Few, on the whole, have retained their original places in the churches, having been<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>displaced by the Iconoclasts of the sixteenth century or by later Art-schools; but in the<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>countries to which the Netherlands exported productions from their workshops,.... Spain,<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>the Rhineland and the Baltic coast of Germany and Sweden,.... there still remain many of<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>them. The prettiest Netherlandish altar-screens in our country (Sweden) are, as a rule, those<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>made by the eminent wood-carver Jan Borman of Brussels, who worked between 1490 and<lb facs="P7_TL00046"/>1520, or later. In Sweden, too, they undoubtedly made altar screens during the fourteenth<lb facs="P7_TL00047"/>century, (Gotland) and later on during the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth.<lb facs="P7_TL00048"/>The works of Swedish carvers, such as St Olaf's screen at VHrrndd Church by one Master<lb facs="P7_TL00049"/>Lars the carver, the St Mary screen by Hakon Gulleson at Enganger, the workmanship of<lb facs="P7_TL00050"/>the Sudermannish " joiners " In the church museum at StrengnSs, are often very simple in<lb facs="P7_TL00051"/>in construction, consisting of a screen, forming a niche for a statue representing some<lb facs="P7_TL00052"/>saint. The opening is sometimes closed by doors on which is painted the legend of the saint,<lb facs="P7_TL00053"/>such being called " Saint's Screens In more elaborated forms the screen is divided into<lb facs="P7_TL00054"/>several niches, of which the middle one contains the scene at Qolgatha or some other figure<lb facs="P7_TL00055"/>scene with images of saints and apostles arranged in those around. This type, or something<lb facs="P7_TL00056"/>akin to it was often made by Swedish artists, but was also imported from Lubeck and<lb facs="P7_TL00057"/>other North German places. s®j®j®j®j®&lt;®j&amp;j®</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00004"/>The Swedish and German productions are, however, far surpassed by the more elaborate<lb facs="P8_TL00005"/>works which we have already mentioned as imported from Brussels and Antwerp. With<lb facs="P8_TL00006"/>their stately proportions and the lavishness of the gilding on every part of the framework<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>and on the garments of the figures, they give an intense glowing effect, and, in the old<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>churches, where lights were scant in the nave yet concentrated in front of the altar, the<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>effect of this light upon figures and framework must have been quite fascinating. &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>&amp; An illumination of this kind, (well adapted for the altar screen) is never seen nowadays,<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>for in the system of illuminating our churches we have rather chosen for model the di<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

We<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>must draw attention to that echo of the pulsating life of their own age which they yet can<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>give.<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>&amp; We have spoken of the Mystery Plays of the closing Middle Ages. The dramatic altar<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>screens give us the very image of these. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>&amp; Look at one of them, the doors in front taken away and one niche-group after another<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>in a row like little houses:.... first the entrance to Jerusalem, then the Lord's Supper, the<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>Tribunal of Pilate, the Cross Bearing, the Crucifixion, etc, and it is undeniable that we<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>have before us an uncommonly true image of the Mystery Scene. That the proportions are<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>reduced in size and the architecture of the little buildings more detailed is a matter of course.<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>&amp; That the above is true, not only of the subjects and types but also of the costumes has<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>not been proved in all particulars but it seems to me quite clear that, in certain cases,<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>such relationship must have existed.

This doubtless was so, to a certain extent, although a prominent<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>feature is the historical character introduced. Christ and the Apostles wear the same kind<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>of semi-antique mantles during the whole of the Middle Ages. Soldiers use armour with<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>Roman details, certainly not entirely accurate, but through which one can trace a wish to<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>represent the real costume of the age of Christ's nativity. Scribes and other persons wear<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>turbans and other Oriental attributes like the Orientals described in the Travel-books of<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>the age, such as Breydenbach's " Journey to Jerusalem.

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>dent that the two different attempts made through different mediums have led to similar<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>results.<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>&amp; Yet it must be admitted that the theatre could hardly have used gold cloth to the same<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>extent as gilding was used in the altar screen,.... for a purely artistic reason of course, as<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>the effect of the gold was thus increased and the danger avoided of making the otherwise<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>realistically represented figures look like dressed-out figures of wax. &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>How strikingly alike the altar screens and the contemporary scenic arrangements were<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>is proved by a series of sketches for tableaux, ordered for the entrance of Queen Joan into<lb facs="P8_TL00045"/>Brussels in 1496. They still exist in the " Kupferstichkabinett " of Berlin, have not been<lb facs="P8_TL00046"/>previously published and seem to be the stage manager's sketches for the said entrance.<lb facs="P8_TL00047"/>The text first sets forth the order of the procession and then follows the disposition of<lb facs="P8_TL00048"/>the tableaux.<lb facs="P8_TL00049"/>&amp; The stage, which was built on trestles, could, if necessary, be closed with curtains, and<lb facs="P8_TL00050"/>was adorned with torches and mirrors. There appeared Judith and Holofernes, Raphael<lb facs="P8_TL00051"/>fighting with the devil, Asmodeus, Esther and Ahasuarus and scenes in which famous women<lb facs="P8_TL00052"/>from the Bible or history took part. Sketches in water-colour show the arrangement of each<lb facs="P8_TL00053"/>particular scene. Many of these are arranged three by three, when consecutive subjects<lb facs="P8_TL00054"/>are required, and these remind us strikingly of the altar screens, the draperies of the theatre<lb facs="P8_TL00055"/>representing the gilded framework of the reredos, and the open bows or arches above the<lb facs="P8_TL00056"/>whole framing each one round burning-mirror, while along the bows are fastened tapers<lb facs="P8_TL00057"/>and torches.<lb facs="P8_TL00058"/>Another question is, which inspired the other, theatre or altar screen? It is a problem<lb facs="P8_TL00059"/>somewhat difficult to solve, and which must probably be solved afresh in every individual</ab>

What we want to point out<lb facs="P9_TL00003"/>is, that there exists a close connection between the dramatic altar screen and the Mystery<lb facs="P9_TL00004"/>Play.<lb facs="P9_TL00005"/>This kind of theatre of the north European public during the Renaissance period,.... a<lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>theatre like a many=toned instrument for the interpretation of sentiments of piety and<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>worldliness, calm and turbulence, splendour, life, love, hatred, pathos and humour, is plainly<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>crystallised in the altar screens.<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>&amp; I think that he who perceives this historical connection will no longer speak of these<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>reredoses of Jan Borman as " dolls' cupboards ".

And perhaps some day this<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>historical interest may carry us so far as to adopt a truer, more artistic way of considering<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>things; perhaps the day will come when we shall give up competing with the restaurants<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>in illuminating our churches and devote ourselves to the favouring of works of art as well<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>as to the practical lighting of hymn=books, and when museums will take the same interest<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>in setting a mediaeval work in the right light as they usually do in the case of renais°<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>sance or later pictures.<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>This seems to be a simple demand,.... but there is, so far as we can see, very little hope<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>of its being granted.</ab>

In 44 les pieces a spectacle " the groups, the masses, which<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>must always make a picture, and bring out the principal personnages, would be disposed<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>more skilfully and in a more spirited manner; but for want of this knowledge I invite<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>comedians to consult at least famous painters and sculptors.<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>CLOTHING. I demand of all women in general the most scrupulous attention to their<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>clothes: the costume adds much to the illusion of tne spectators, and the comedian enters<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>more easily into the tone of his role: nevertheless, the costume followed exactly Is unfeasible:<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>it would be unseemly and mean. Draperies copied from the antique design and uncover<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>the body too much; they are suitable only for statues and pictures; but in adding to them<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>what is wanting, the cut must be preserved, the intentions must at least be indicated, and,<lb facs="P9_TL00037"/>as far as possible, the luxury or simplicity of the times and places must be followed. Fillets,<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>flowers, beads, veils, coloured stones, were the only ornaments women knew before the<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>establishment of Indian commerce and the conquest of the New World. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>What I desire above all is, that all frills and furbelows, all fashions of the moment be<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>avoided.

                                    <lb facs="P10_TL00005"/>Maid Marian. None of the materials that constitute the more authentical history of<lb facs="P10_TL00006"/>Robin Hood, prove the existence of such a character in the shape of his mistress. There<lb facs="P10_TL00007"/>is a pretty French pastoral drama of the eleventh or twelfth century, entitled Le jeu du<lb facs="P10_TL00008"/>berger et de la bergere in which the principal characters are Robin and Marian, a shepherd<lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>and shepherdess. Mr Warton thought that our English Marian might be illustrated from<lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>this composition; but Mr Ritson is unwilling to assent to this opinion, on the ground that<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>the French Robin and Marion 4&lt;are not the Robin and Marian of Sherwood." Yet Mr Warton<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>probably meant no more than that the name of Marian had been suggested from the above<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>drama, which was a great favourite among the common people in France, and performed<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>much about the season at which the May games were celebrated in England. The great<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>intercourse between the countries m ight have been the means of importing this name<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>amidst an infinite variety of other matters; and there is indeed no other mode of accounting<lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>for the introduction of a name which never occurs in the page of English history. (1)<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>&amp; We have seen that the story of Robin Hood was, at a very early period, of a dramatic<lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>cast; and it was perfectly natural that a principal character should be transferred from one<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>drama to another. It might be thought likewise that the English Robin deserved his Marian<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>as well as the other. The circumstance of the French Marian being acted by a boy contributes<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>to support the above opinion; the part of the English character having been personated,<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>though not always, in like manner. Little, if any, stress can be laid on the authority of<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>an old play cited by Mr Steevens to prove that "Maid Marian was originally a name<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>assumed by Matilda the daughter of Robert Lord Fitzwater, while Robin Hood remained<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>in a state of outlawry. (2) This is rather to be considered as a dramatic fiction, designed<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>to explain a character the origin of which had been long forgotten. &amp; &amp;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P11_TL00002"/>Maid Marian not only officiated as the paramour of Robin Hood in the May games, but<lb facs="P11_TL00003"/>as the queen or lady of the May, who seems to have been introduced long before the<lb facs="P11_TL00004"/>games of Robin Hood. In the isle of Man they not only elected a queen of May, but likewise<lb facs="P11_TL00005"/>a queen of winter (1). Gatherings for the May lady, as anciently for Robin Hood, were lately<lb facs="P11_TL00006"/>kept up at Cambridge, but in a corrupted form, the real occasion of this ceremony being,<lb facs="P11_TL00007"/>in all probability, quite unknown to the gatherers. There can be no doubt that the queen<lb facs="P11_TL00008"/>of the May is the legitimate representative of the Goddess Flora in the Roman festival. <lb facs="P11_TL00009"/>&amp; The introduction of Robin Hood into the celebration of May probably suggested the<lb facs="P11_TL00010"/>addition of a king or lord of May. In the year 1306 Robert Bruce caused himself<lb facs="P11_TL00011"/>to be crowned at Scone, and a second time by the hands of his mistress, the adulterous<lb facs="P11_TL00012"/>wife of the earl of Bowhan, who changed his name to David. It is reported that he said to<lb facs="P11_TL00013"/>his own wife on this occasion, 44 Yesterday we were but earl and countess, today we are<lb facs="P11_TL00014"/>king and queen;" to which she replied, 44 True, you are now a summer king, but you may<lb facs="P11_TL00015"/>not chance to be a winter one." Matthew of Westminster has recorded this fact, and<lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>Holinshed, who copies him, makes the lady say, that 44 She feared they should prove but<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>as a summer king and queen, such as in country townes the young folks chose for sport to<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>dance about may-poles". &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>In 1557 there was a May game in Fenchurch street, with a Lord and Lady of the May,4<lb facs="P11_TL00020"/>and a morris dance. (2) Both these characters are introduced in a morris in Fletcher's play<lb facs="P11_TL00021"/>of 44 The two noble kinsmen ", Act iii; and, in the 44 Knight of the burning pestle ", a grocer's<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>apprentice personates a lord of the May dressed out in 44 scarves, feathers and rings ". He<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>is made to deliver a speech from the conduit to the populace, of which this is a part.<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>44 London, to thee I do present the merry month of May,<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>Let each true subject be content to hear me what 1 say:<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>For from the top of conduit-head, as plainly may appear,<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>I will both tell my name to you, and wherefore I came here.<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>My name is Rafe, by due descent, though not ignoble I,<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>Yet far inferiour to the flock of gracious grocery.<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>And by the common counsel of my fellows in the Strand,<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>With gilded staff, and crossed skarfe. the May lord here I stand."<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>&amp; A lord and lady are still preserved in some places where the Whitsun-ales continue to<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>be celebrated, and perhaps in other morrises during the season of May. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>&amp; To return to Maid Marian She was usually dressed according to the fashion of the time,<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>as we may collect from the figures of her in Mr Tollett' s window, and Israel' s engraving.<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>In both the kirtle and petticoat are alike; and the pendent veil is supported by the hand.<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>The English figure holds a flower, and has a fancy coronet as Queen of the May. The other<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>has apparently an apple ip her hand, and her steeple head dress is what was actually worn<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>in the middle of the fifteenth century by queens and ladies of high rank. Barnaby Rich,<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>who wrote in the reigns of Elizabeth and James I., inveighing against the foppery of man's<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>apparel, exclaims, 44 And from commeth this wearing, and this embroidering of long<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>44 locks, this curiosity that is used amongst men in frizeling and curling of their haire, this<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>44gentlewoman-like starcht bands, so be-edged and belaced, fitter for Maid Marian in a<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>44Moris dance, then for him that hath either that spirit or courage that shold be in a<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>"gentleman?" (3) &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>It appears that the lady of the May was sometimes carried in procession on men 's<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>shoulders; for Stephen Batman, speaking of the Pope and his ceremonies states that he is<lb facs="P11_TL00048"/>carried on the backs of fourjdeacons, 44 after the maner of carying whytepot queenes in</ab>

(2) Thus in the description<lb facs="P12_TL00005"/>of the family visit to the royal guest, in the old ballad of " The miller of Mansfield <lb facs="P12_TL00006"/>" And so they Jetted down towards the king' s hall;<lb facs="P12_TL00007"/>The merry old miller, with his hands on his side;<lb facs="P12_TL00008"/>His wife, like Maid Marian did wince at that tide.<lb facs="P12_TL00009"/>&amp; But although the may-lady was originally a character of some delicacy and importance,<lb facs="P12_TL00010"/>she appears to have afterwards declined in both respects. <lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>In the time of Elizabeth she was usually represented by some smooth-faced and<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>effeminate youth. (3) Falstaff tells the hostess, that " for womanhood Maid Marian may<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>be the Deputy's wife of the ward to her;" meaning perhaps that she was as masculine in<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>her appearance as the country clown who personated Maid Marian: and in Fletcher' s<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>" Monsieur Thomas ", Dorothea desires her brother to conduct himself with more gentleness<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>towards his mistress, unless he would chuse to marry Malkyn the May lady; another allusion<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>to the degraded state of Maid Marian, who is here assimilated to a vulgar drudge or scullion<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>both in name and condition. The translator of " The hospitall of incurable fooles, " 1600<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>4to, speaking of Acco, the old woman who became mad on beholding her ugliness in a mirror,<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>says that " one while shee could be as merrje as Maid Marrian.

                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>acter, even in later times, uniformly vulgar. Every one will call to mind Nicholas Breton's<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>pretty sonnet of " Phyllida and Corydon ", where the shepherdess,<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>" with garlands gay<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>Was made the Lady of the Maye."<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>THE PIPER. Sometimes called Tom Piper, an obvious and necessary attendant on a<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>morris, and who requires very little illustration. Mr Steevens has already referred to Drayton<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>for the mention of him; and Spenser, in his third eclogue, speaking of the rimes of bad<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>poets, observes that, " Tom Piper makes as little melodie;" whence we are to infer that<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>his music was not usually of the very best kind. The resemblance as to attitude and dress,<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>between the figures of this character in Mr Tollett's painting and the Flemish print, is re®<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>markable. In both we have the sword and feather. What Mr Tollett has termed his'silver<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>shield' seems a mistake for the lower part or flap of his stomacher. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>THE HOBBY-HORSE of which the earliest vestige now remaining is in the painted<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>window at Betley. It has been already observed that he was often omitted in the morris.<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>During the reign of Elizabeth the Puritans made considerable havoc among the May®games,<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>by their preachings and invectives. Poor Maid Marian was assimilated to the whore of Ba®<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>bylon; friar Tuck was deemed a remnant of Popery, and the Hobby®horse an impious and<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>Pagan superstition; and they were at length most completely put to the rout as the bitterest<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>enemies of religion. King James's Book of Sports restored the lady and the hobby®horse:<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>but during the Commonwealth they were again attacked by a new set of fanatics; and to®<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>gether with the whole of the May festivities, the Whitsun®ales, etc, in many parts of England<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>degraded. At the Restoration they were once more revived. (4) The allusions to the omission</ab>

They were executed by Vinckenboom, about the end of the reign<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>of James I., and exhibit views of the above palace ; in one of these pictures a morris dance<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>is introduced, consisting of seven figures, viz. a fool, a hobby-horse, a piper, a Maid Marian,<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>and three other dancers, the rest of the figures being spectators, Of these the first four<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>and one of the dancers are reduced in the annexed plate from a tracing made by the late<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>Captain Grose. The fool has an inflated bladder or eel-skin with a ladle at the end of it,<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>nd with this he is collecting money. The piper is pretty much in his original state ; but<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>the hobby-horse wants the legerdemain apparatus, and Maid Marian is not remarkable for<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>the elegance of her person. &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>Dr. Plott, in his History of Staffordshire, p. 434, mentions that within memory, at<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>Abbot's or Paget's Bromley, they had a sort of sport which they celebrated at Christmas,<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>or on new year and twelfth days, called the Hobby-horse dance, from a person who car<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>ried the image of a horse between his legs made of thin boards, and in his hand a bow and<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>arrow. The latter passing through a hole in the bow, and stopping on a shoulder, made a<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>snapping noise when drawn to and fro, keeping time with the musick. With this man danced<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>six others, carrying on their shoulders as many reindeer heads, with the arms of the chief<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>families to whom the revenues of the town belonged. They danced the heys and other<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>country dances. To the above hobby horse dance there belonged a pot, which was kept by<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>turns by the reeves of the town, who provided cakes and ale to put into this pot; all people<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>who had any kindness for the good intent of the institution of the sport giving pence a<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>piece for themselves and families. Foreigners also that came to see it contributed ; and the<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>money, after defraying the expense of the cakes and ale, went to repair the church and<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>support the poor: which charges, adds the doctor, are not now perhaps so cheerfully borne.<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>A short time before the revolution in France, the May games and morris dance were<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>celebrated in many parts of that country, accompanied by a fool and a hobby-horse. The<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>latter was termed un chevalet; and, if the authority of Minsheu be not questionable, the<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>Spaniards had the same character under the name of tarasoa. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>THE DRAGON, The earliest mention of him as a part of the morris dance we have<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>already seen in the extract from Stubbes's Anatomie of abuses; and he is likewise introduced<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>in a morris, in Sampson's play of the Vowbreaker, or fayre maid of Clifton, 1633, where<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>a fellow says, "I'll be a fiery dragonon which, another, who had undertaken the<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>hobby-horse, observes that he will be "a thund'ring Saint George as ever rode on horseback."<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>This seems to afford a clue to the use of this dragon', who was probably attacked in some<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>ludicrous manner by the hobby-horse saint, and may perhaps be the Devil alluded to in the<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>extract already given from Fetherstone's Dialogue against dancing. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>THE MORRIS DANCERS. By these are meant the common dancers in the late morrises,<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>and who were not distinguished by any particular appellation, though in earlier times it is<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>probable that each individual had his separate title. If there were any reason for a contrary<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>opinion, it might depend on the costume of numbers 10 and 11 in Mr. Tollett's window, which<lb facs="P15_TL00053"/>may perhaps belong to the present class. There are likewise two similar figures in the Flemish<lb facs="P15_TL00054"/>print; and the coincidence in their attitudes is no less remarkable than it is in those of some<lb facs="P15_TL00055"/>of the other characters. The circumstance too of one only wearing a feather in his hat is de*<lb facs="P15_TL00056"/>serving of notice, as it is the same in both the representations. The streamers which proceed<lb facs="P15_TL00057"/>from their sleeves and flutter in the wind, though continued in very modern times, were</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00006"/>paper, and sometimes in coats of white<lb facs="P16_TL00007"/>spangled fustian. They had purses at their<lb facs="P16_TL00008"/>girdles, and garters to which bells were atta®<lb facs="P16_TL00009"/>ched (2). The latter have been always a part<lb facs="P16_TL00010"/>of the furniture of the more active characters<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>in the morris, and the use of them is of great<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>antiquity. The tinkling ornaments to the<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>feet among the Jewish women are reprobated<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>in Isaiah iii. 10. 18. Gratius Faliscus, who<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>wrote his poem on hunting in the time of Au»<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>gustus, has alluded to the practice of dancing<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>with bells on the feet among the Egyptian</ab>

"<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>Cyne get icon, lib. I. 42.<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>There is good reason for believing that the morris bells were borrowed from the genuine<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>Moorish dance; a circumstance that tends to corroborate the opinion that has been al«<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>ready offered with respect to the etymology of the morris. Among the beautiful habits of<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>various nations, published by Hans Weigel at Nuremberg, in «577» there Is the figure of an<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>African lady of the kingdom of Fez in the act of dancing, with bells at her feet. &amp;<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>The number of bells round each leg of the morris dancers amounted from twenty to<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>forty (3). They had various appellations, as the fore=bell, the second bell, the treble, the<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>tenor, the base, and the double bell. Sometimes they used trebles only; but these refine®<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>ments were of later times (4). The bells were occasionally Jingled by the hands, or placed<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>on the arms or wrists of the parties. Scarves., ribbands, and laces hung all over with gold<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>rings, and even precious stones, are also mentioned in the time of Elizabeth (5). The miller,<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>in the play of the Vowbreaker, says he is come to borrow '* a few ribbandes, bracelets,<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>earerings, wyertyers, and silke girdles and handkerchers for a morice and a show before<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>the queene." The handkerchiefs, or napkins (6) as they are sometimes called, were held in<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>the hand, or tied to the shoulders (7). In Shirley's Lady of pleausure, 1637, Act i.

Sometimes the</ab>

Mr. Strutt has observed that<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>on his sixteenth plate there are only five, exclusive of the two musicians; but it is con=<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>celved that what he refers to is not a morris, but a dance of fools, There is a pamphlet<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>entitled, Old Aieg of Herefordshire for a Mayd Marian and Hereford town for a morris<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>dance, or 33 morris dance is in Herefordshire of 1200 years old, 3609, 4to (3). In the<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>painting by Vinckenboom, at Richmond, there are seven figures. In Blount's Glossographia,<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>1656, the Morisco is defined, " a dance wherein there were usually five men and a boy<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>dressed in a girles habit, whom they call Maid Marrian. " The morris in Fletcher's Two<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>noble kinsmen contains some characters, which, as they are 110 where else to be found,<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>might have been the poet's own invention, and designed for stage effect: &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>" The chambermaid, and serving man by night<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>That seek out silent hanging: Then mine host<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>And his fat spouse, that welcomes to their cost<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>The gauled traveller, and with a beckning<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>Informs the tapster to inflame the reck'ning.<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>Then the beast-eating clown, and next the fool,<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>The Bavian, with long tail and eke long tool,<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>Cum multis aliis, that make a dance.

He remarks that the<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>execution of the whole is too rude to merit a copy, a position that is not meant to be<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>controverted ; but it is necessary to introduce the cut in this place for the purpose of cor<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

It is proper<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>to mention that it originally appeared on the title page to the first known edition of<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>Robin Hood's gailand, printed In 1670, i8mo. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>f<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>Now this cut is certainly not the representation of a morris dance, but merely of the<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>principal characters belonging to the garland. These are, Robin Hood, Little John, queen<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>Catherine, the bishop, the curtal frier, (not Tuck,) and the beggar. Even though it were<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>admitted that Maid Marian and Friar Tuck were intended to be given, it could not be<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>maintained that either the bishop or the beggar made part of a morris. &amp; jg?<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>There still remain some characters in Mr. Tollett's window, of which 110 description<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>can be here attempted, viz.

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00004"/>proprietor would, doubtless, have seen the necessity of reconsidering his explanations (1).<lb facs="P18_TL00005"/>The resemblance between the two ancient representations is sufficiently remarkable to<lb facs="P18_TL00006"/>warrant a conjecture that the window has been originally executed by some foreign artist;<lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>and that the panes with the English friar, the hobby-horse, and the may-pole have been<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>since added. &amp; jg? &amp;<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>Mr. Waldron has informed us that he saw in the summer of 1785, at Richmond in Surrey,<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>a troop of morris dancers from Abingdon, accompanied by a fool in a motley jacket, who<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>carried in his hand a staff about two feef long, with a blown bladder at the end of it, with<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>which he either buffeted the crowd to keep them at a proper distance from the dancers,<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>or played tricks for the diversion of the spectators. The dancers and the fool were Berkshire<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>husbandmen taking an annual circuit to collect money (2). Mr. Ritson too has noticed that<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>morris dancers are yet annualty seen in Norfolk, and make their constant appearance in<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>Lancashire. He has also preserved a newspaper article respecting some morris dancers of<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>Pendleton, who paid their annual visit to Salford, in 1792 (3) ; and a very few years since<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>another company of this kind was seen at Usk In Monmouthshire, which was attended by<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>a boy Maid Marian, a hobby-horse, and a fool. They professed to have kept up the ceremony<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>at that place for the last three hundred years. It has been thought worth while to record<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>these modern instances, because it is extremely probable that from the present rage for<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>refinement and innovation, there wili remain, in the course of a short time, but few vestiges<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>of our popular customs and antiquities. &amp; &lt;£? &amp;7 £7</ab>

Too many of the failures<lb facs="P21_TL00008"/>in the Theatre can be attributed to lack of discipline. Think of how many plays never get<lb facs="P21_TL00009"/>as far as the first rehearsal because the actress is displeased with her maid ! I know of a<lb facs="P21_TL00010"/>case where a series of twelve plays was going to be produced by a famous European actress.<lb facs="P21_TL00011"/>The stage director and the actress were to have prepared these together. Everything was<lb facs="P21_TL00012"/>decided and the director had gone to commence his part of the work. Suddenly he received<lb facs="P21_TL00013"/>a telegram. "Hedda Gabler impossible. No one to play servant." He turned to the second<lb facs="P21_TL00014"/>play which was, let us say, the " Lady from the Sea ". Next day a second telegram. "So<lb facs="P21_TL00015"/>sorry width of stage only 36 instead of 37 feet. Obliged to put off Lady from the Sea." So<lb facs="P21_TL00016"/>he turned to the third play. "John Gabriel Borkman when a third telegram arrived,<lb facs="P21_TL00017"/>" Can't do John Gabriel Borkman. All my actors too foolish. " Then he turned to the fourth<lb facs="P21_TL00018"/>play, "Edipus Rex." Another telegram; "We won't proceed with Edipus Rex; don't like<lb facs="P21_TL00019"/>the play." On the following day he looked through the plays which were left and, with a<lb facs="P21_TL00020"/>feeling of security on seeing 'Hamlet' set to work on that. Promptly arrived a telegram,<lb facs="P21_TL00021"/>" Hamlet most gloomy play I ever read. Makes me gloomy to read it so am obliged to cut<lb facs="P21_TL00022"/>it out of repertoire." He-turned then to "Much Ado about Nothing" which was included<lb facs="P21_TL00023"/>in the list but received a sixth telegram in the morning. " Was ever anything so ludicrous<lb facs="P21_TL00024"/>as this play. I can't bear to think of an audience indulging in laughter all the time. Leave<lb facs="P21_TL00025"/>out Much Ado About Nothing." And this went on until there was not one of the twelve<lb facs="P21_TL00026"/>left. &amp; &amp; &amp; *&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00027"/>PLAYGOER. Ah, 1 can guess to whom you are referring. But remember how she<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>leans against the door in that play by Sudermann!<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>&amp; STAGE DIRECTOR. Yes, certainly. But the value of a moment like that does not<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>compensate for the loss of twelve splendid productions and the loss of everybody's temper<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>into the bargain. Shakespeare or any great author is not judged as great for the moments<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>but for the whole play and for his whole life's work. Yet we rave about an actress for<lb facs="P21_TL00033"/>the sake of her 'moments'.<lb facs="P21_TL00034"/>&amp; P L A Y G O E R. Then do you not value temperament? &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00035"/>STAGE DIRECTOR. Certainly ; but I value only that temperament which is strong<lb facs="P21_TL00036"/>enough to become disciplined.<lb facs="P21_TL00037"/>PLAYGOER. Oh, can you show me any disciplined people who also have temperament?<lb facs="P21_TL00038"/>jz? ST A G E DIRECTOR. Yes, the great artists. &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00039"/>&amp; PLAYGOER. But these are exceptions. Can you tell me of any calling where tempe<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P21_TL00040"/>rament and discipline are equally balanced ? <lb facs="P21_TL00041"/>&amp; S T A G E DIRECTOR. Certainly, the sailor's.<lb facs="P21_TL00042"/>&amp; PLAYGOER. But there is a great deal of difference between the temperament of the<lb facs="P21_TL00043"/>sailor and of the artist.<lb facs="P21_TL00044"/>STAGE DIRECTOR. Precisely. And there should be none. When we talk of an artist's<lb facs="P21_TL00045"/>temperament we generally mean a lot of nervous disorders. Away with your temperament,<lb facs="P21_TL00046"/>then! Perhaps if we get discipline something may come of it. At present nothing but<lb facs="P21_TL00047"/>disturbance comes from your "temperament".<lb facs="P21_TL00048"/>&amp; P L A Y G O E R. I think that you are very extreme in your view!<lb facs="P21_TL00049"/>&amp; STAGE DIRECTOR. Yes, I speak in one extreme because 1 find you speaking in the<lb facs="P21_TL00050"/>other. You get warm when you speak of temperament, and I become cold when I think of<lb facs="P21_TL00051"/>the damage it does to the stage; and so I advance the theory that discipline is the one<lb facs="P21_TL00052"/>and only thing. I know that both are necessary, but that both must be quite genuine. &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00053"/>&amp; Let the temperament of each actor develop for all that temperament is worth, and let<lb facs="P21_TL00054"/>the sense of discipline be developed in every actor in proportion to the force of his tem<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P21_TL00055"/>perament. Do not let temperament be an excuse for absense of discipline. It is this which<lb facs="P21_TL00056"/>is killing the modern theatre.<lb facs="P21_TL00057"/>We want in the Theatre the same discipline that there is on a ship, and we want the<lb facs="P21_TL00058"/>direction of that ship or theatre to be in the hands of one man who is thoroughly disci<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Then you want the State to be responsable for your theatre?<lb facs="P22_TL00008"/>STAGE DIRECTOR. Not for one theatre but for every theatre in the land. As it<lb facs="P22_TL00009"/>is for its navy. If the State is responsible for one theatre it will not take any trouble<lb facs="P22_TL00010"/>to study the whole question of the relationship of theatre to Nation, but if it has the<lb facs="P22_TL00011"/>responsibility of every theatre it will take great care to do so. And it would be an easier<lb facs="P22_TL00012"/>thing to manage all the theatres of England than it would be to manage one National<lb facs="P22_TL00013"/>Theatre in London. Conceive the idea of having one Man=of=War which belonged to the<lb facs="P22_TL00014"/>Nation, while all the others were the product of private enterprise. If you are going to<lb facs="P22_TL00015"/>change'the order of things as the National Theatre sets out to do, then you must have<lb facs="P22_TL00016"/>sufficient power to enforce that change, and one National Theatre against all the theatres<lb facs="P22_TL00017"/>of private enterprise will have no chance whatever. &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00018"/>&amp; PLAYGOER. Bo you know I was thinking the same thing myself the other day. I was<lb facs="P22_TL00019"/>at the committee meeting for the collection of funds for the National Theatre and I had<lb facs="P22_TL00020"/>half a mind to say what you have just said. &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00021"/>&amp; STAGE DIRECTOR.

Let us<lb facs="P22_TL00030"/>go then and learn discipline at their hands. But let us not attempt to teach them that or<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>any other folly. Come, lest we be late.

                                    <lb facs="P22_TL00040"/>n one of the leading theatres in London I have had the curious experience<lb facs="P22_TL00041"/>of hearing very well paid young employes saying to each other " Lend me<lb facs="P22_TL00042"/>The Mask after you've finished with it " .<lb facs="P22_TL00043"/>It may be considered a hopeful sign that one young employe had purchased<lb facs="P22_TL00044"/>The Mask, but let no one cherish this delusion. It was the mana ger's copy I<lb facs="P22_TL00045"/>Now The Mask is published, as those closely connected with it know,<lb facs="P22_TL00046"/>with particular pleasure for the general pain of the English theatre's young.<lb facs="P22_TL00047"/>It is by no means made to tickle their fancy or to flatter them up the right<lb facs="P22_TL00048"/>way but to give them as much pain as can possibly be inflicted, and we<lb facs="P22_TL00049"/>who hold this aim before us believe that we are succeeding in this, and</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P22_TL00052"/>there is only one thing that we have to complain about. It is that these young employes<lb facs="P22_TL00053"/>positively refuse to add to our pleasure In return; that Is to say, they never subscribe. &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00054"/>I know it is quite unusual to make such a statement as this, but I have the Editor's<lb facs="P22_TL00055"/>permission to make it, though he tells me at the same time that In consequence The Mask<lb facs="P22_TL00056"/>has lost one of its publishers, who has gone to be a bellringer in a church. StilL The Mask<lb facs="P22_TL00057"/>is ever regardless of consequences, so Mr Semar, even in view of this, has not withdrawn his<lb facs="P22_TL00058"/>permission which sets me free to expose this weakness of ours, and to say that The Mask<lb facs="P22_TL00059"/>has only SIX SUBSCRIBERS ON THE ENGLISH STAGE, (i) &amp; &amp; JS&gt;</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P23_TL00002"/>Now this fact gives him, and those of us who are associated with him in his work, more<lb facs="P23_TL00003"/>infernal delight than fit would he possible to do justice to by mere words. The lavish<lb facs="P23_TL00004"/>display of all these young employes dawdling round the theatre, loaning the single well«<lb facs="P23_TL00005"/>thumbed copy from the manager, is one of the most brilliant achievements of the English<lb facs="P23_TL00006"/>stage,<lb facs="P23_TL00007"/>How is it to be accounted for? Every one in London knows of The Mask through the<lb facs="P23_TL00008"/>Press. The English Press for some reason or other is always allowing bursts of enthusiasm<lb facs="P23_TL00009"/>to get the better of its common sense when speaking about The Mask. Every half year the<lb facs="P23_TL00010"/>English critics attempt to assume a more serious attitude towards The Mask. Every half-year<lb facs="P23_TL00011"/>they complete a half-finished sentence of warning, and then burst out into a hearty chorus<lb facs="P23_TL00012"/>of enthusiastic approval. And YET the young employes refuse to purchase The Mask. For<lb facs="P23_TL00013"/>what reason? They are not frightened of it. It gives them pain, to be sure, but they rather<lb facs="P23_TL00014"/>like that, especially if they can share it over one copy. They know that the journal<lb facs="P23_TL00015"/>is cram full of good things, serious things, and jolly things, pretty things and ugly<lb facs="P23_TL00016"/>things. What more do they want<lb facs="P23_TL00017"/>Do you think it is that they want to be on the Free List ? Not at all I Do not imagine<lb facs="P23_TL00018"/>such a thing. If they were on the Free List they would not want to read the journal and<lb facs="P23_TL00019"/>would only carry it in the street to frighten their superiors. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00020"/>No, the truth of it is that the young employes who are working for the managers of<lb facs="P23_TL00021"/>London dislike study, dislike reading books in fact dislike work of all kinds. &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00022"/>But there is another reason why the young employe has not got a bound volume of<lb facs="P23_TL00023"/>The Mask at home. It is because he would feel that it was extremely extravagant to spend<lb facs="P23_TL00024"/>a shilling a month upon printed matter which is only calculated to make him wince. If<lb facs="P23_TL00025"/>there is a thing the young man dislikes it is mental athletics. Like many Englishmen he<lb facs="P23_TL00026"/>has the good trait of being extremely obstinate. If he were not obstinate every first night<lb facs="P23_TL00027"/>performance would be a scandalous failure. It is through sheer obstinacy that he faces<lb facs="P23_TL00028"/>and out-faces the public. I have a great admiration for this obstinacy but I believe that<lb facs="P23_TL00029"/>in matters relating to the Arts it is a trifle over=done in England. For after all it doesn't<lb facs="P23_TL00030"/>really matter whose opinion is right. Whether Gordon Craig's opinion is right or Oswald<lb facs="P23_TL00031"/>StoSl's opinion is wrong, or whether William Archer's opinion is different from both: and<lb facs="P23_TL00032"/>so it does not matter whether the young employe at St Stephen's Theatre is right or<lb facs="P23_TL00033"/>whether Mr Allen Carrie, my companion on the staff of this journal, is right. Upon the<lb facs="P23_TL00034"/>art of ringing the curtain up and down there are only two men whose opinions count:<lb facs="P23_TL00035"/>they are the man downstairs with his finger on the bell and the other man upstairs with<lb facs="P23_TL00036"/>his hand on the wheel. But it does not seem entirely unreasonable that Johan Wolfgang<lb facs="P23_TL00037"/>Goethe should also have an opinion upon these subtle points of stage craft, that each of the<lb facs="P23_TL00038"/>three should listen to what the others have to say and that the truth should really be<lb facs="P23_TL00039"/>allowed to emerge between the soft clash of differences. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P23_TL00040"/>In The Mask and through The Mask we create this delicate disturbance. But in England<lb facs="P23_TL00041"/>the lips are so tightly pressed together, the eyebrows so indifferently raised, the eyes so<lb facs="P23_TL00042"/>entirely expressionless that one would think that they had never understood this truth,<lb facs="P23_TL00043"/>i. e., that truth only emerges when opposites meet. Where people are gathered together who<lb facs="P23_TL00044"/>refuse to discuss amiably men arise who are forced into uttering paradoxes. These men<lb facs="P23_TL00045"/>are obliged to impersonate the two contrary forces. It does not disclose a healthy social<lb facs="P23_TL00046"/>condition when one man has to breathe the truth alone. He is obliged to give birth to<lb facs="P23_TL00047"/>these paradoxes and people naturally think that is very queer. They don't know that it is<lb facs="P23_TL00048"/>their own fault and that if they would only loosen themselves and give expression to their<lb facs="P23_TL00049"/>airy somethings or nothings, something would be sure to come from it. Of course what I<lb facs="P23_TL00050"/>mean is that The Mask is uttering valuable truths which it would much prefer to arrive<lb facs="P23_TL00051"/>at in some other way.<lb facs="P23_TL00052"/>&amp; But I had intended to be a little less serious about all this!<lb facs="P23_TL00053"/>If I were to persuade the Editor to publish the names of those on the English stage<lb facs="P23_TL00054"/>who subscribe for this journal it might perhaps prove rather too comic, and that is not<lb facs="P23_TL00055"/>my wish either. d<lb facs="P23_TL00056"/>Perhaps a little later on The Mask will grow a trifle more personal. You have noticed<lb facs="P23_TL00057"/>that where we can we havis always avoided speaking of any particalar theatre and its ec«</ab>

But I daresay that in the course of six months it may be<lb facs="P24_TL00006"/>found advisable to particularise. To speak a little, for instance, of His Majesty's Theatre, to<lb facs="P24_TL00007"/>come to the question of the St James's Theatre, not to leave unmentioned the Haymarket<lb facs="P24_TL00008"/>Theatre, no, nor the Lyric, the Garrick or the Queen's. &amp; jg? &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00009"/>&amp; For example in regard to His Majesty's, (although the six months is not yet up), I have<lb facs="P24_TL00010"/>noticed in the Saturday Review of May 7th that 44 Rusticus " has been writing some rather<lb facs="P24_TL00011"/>queer things about Sir Herbert Tree. x &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00012"/>&amp; Now, every word he has said is in a way entirely right and it is well that he has said<lb facs="P24_TL00013"/>it. It is about the cheekiest piece of stuff that has yet appeared upon an actor who is forced<lb facs="P24_TL00014"/>against his will to take himself &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00015"/>&amp; Sir Herbert has no desire to take himself seriously. He is the greatest acter that has<lb facs="P24_TL00016"/>yet been upon earth in the one respect that he has positively acted at being an actor. A<lb facs="P24_TL00017"/>wise man, (one of the wisest in London,) he has seen that the modern Theatre is the Music<lb facs="P24_TL00018"/>Hall of the world. He has acted, not as people have so often said, to captivate the vain<lb facs="P24_TL00019"/>public; he has acted for one man alone; he has acted for himself. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00020"/>When with the slightly swaggering gait he comes 011 to his stage he is thinking to himself<lb facs="P24_TL00021"/>4* how nice it tastes ; what a delicious feeling. " And as he looks at the audience a strange<lb facs="P24_TL00022"/>expression irradiates his face; he steps back somewhat shyly, and one feels he must be<lb facs="P24_TL00023"/>saying, 44 No, not all of them are fools." &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00024"/>&amp; And to see this is to see something very interesting. To study the psychology of such<lb facs="P24_TL00025"/>an actor is the delight of the man in the audience who Is conscious that he is the only man<lb facs="P24_TL00026"/>present who is not a &amp;<lb facs="P24_TL00027"/>Everybody admiring Sir Herbert Tree for this profound contempt of the theatre must<lb facs="P24_TL00028"/>write feelingly about him. 44 Rusticus ", after a stroll in the Sussex lanes to cool his heated<lb facs="P24_TL00029"/>imagination, enters his old farm house, and writes to the Saturday Review saying how<lb facs="P24_TL00030"/>greatly he admires 44 Sir Herbert Tree's public spiritedness and courage in venturing to<lb facs="P24_TL00031"/>produce in so short a time so many master-pieces. " How he admires Sir Herbert Tree<lb facs="P24_TL00032"/>44 because he is genial, earnest, and he has charm". How 44 his Shylock is excellent; his<lb facs="P24_TL00033"/>make-up in Falstaff magnificent; his Malvolio nearly perfect". And then, (For 4Rusticus'<lb facs="P24_TL00034"/>loves his theatre), he proceeds to tell Sir Herbert the truth. But though it may be a truth<lb facs="P24_TL00035"/>that he has told, unfortunately it is not the truth, because if the entire world were to call<lb facs="P24_TL00036"/>Sir Herbert 44 ridiculous " 44 absurd " and 44 preposterous " they would only be saying that<lb facs="P24_TL00037"/>which Sir Herbert in his heart of hearts desires them to say.<lb facs="P24_TL00038"/>&amp; He is the living symbol of the preposterousness of the English stage of 1910. He stands<lb facs="P24_TL00039"/>in the centre of the stage a parody of all that is beautiful, but conscious that he is a<lb facs="P24_TL00040"/>parody,., .. a profoundly pathetic figure crucifed upon a paradox triumphant,<lb facs="P24_TL00041"/>And that is the truth.</ab>

There are five Acts, comprising twenty-three Scenes, very unequally divided,<lb facs="P25_TL00032"/>but in the first copy there is no scenic division. Following the course I have adopted in<lb facs="P25_TL00033"/>other comedies, I would venture to divide this play into six Acts with only four set-scenes,<lb facs="P25_TL00034"/>as thus:— &amp; &lt;£?<lb facs="P25_TL00035"/>1. Rousillon : the interior of the hall, Acts I., III., and VI.<lb facs="P25_TL00036"/>2. Paris: a room in the King's Palace, Act II<lb facs="P25_TL00037"/>3. Florence: without the walls, Act IV.<lb facs="P25_TL00038"/>4. Florence : a room in the widow's house, Act V.<lb facs="P25_TL00039"/>&amp; Some of the scenes are so unimportant that there need be very little hesitation in<lb facs="P25_TL00040"/>omitting them. These are the 2nd of Act II., the 1st and 3rd of Act III., the 5th of Act IV.,<lb facs="P25_TL00041"/>and the 1st and 2nd of Act V. The 2nd Scene of Act I. may without any inconsistency be<lb facs="P25_TL00042"/>removed so as to form the 1st Scene in Act II. The 3rd Act might be divided at the end<lb facs="P25_TL00043"/>of the 4th Scene, and the three remaining Scenes taken with the four Florentine Scenes of<lb facs="P25_TL00044"/>the 4th Act may be divided Into two Acts (4 and 5)—an exterior and an interior at Florence.<lb facs="P25_TL00045"/>&amp; Our first set-scene represents, in the words of the stage directions, 44 a room I11 the<lb facs="P25_TL00046"/>Countess's palace, Rousillon". As we are not called on to supply the scene of the historical<lb facs="P25_TL00047"/>event, and as no special Chateau or Countess Is intended by our author, we are free to<lb facs="P25_TL00048"/>select any Interior that will best suit the and nature of the particular stage we may<lb facs="P25_TL00049"/>have to use, provided only that we remember that we are in that old province of France,<lb facs="P25_TL00050"/>now known as the Eastern Pyrenees, and that the Mediaeval architecture of the district was<lb facs="P25_TL00051"/>from first to last impressed—I will not say with a Romanesque but with a Roman character.<lb facs="P25_TL00052"/>To Perpignan, Carcassonne, Perigeux and Toulouse, we must look rather than to Pierre<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The<lb facs="P26_TL00009"/>walls and gate should look almost new ; for it was only twenty=nine years (1620) before<lb facs="P26_TL00010"/>the date above assigned to the action of this play that the fortifications were surveyed by<lb facs="P26_TL00011"/>the French and extensive reconstructions ordered, with the addition of those large"* round<lb facs="P26_TL00012"/>bastions, then a special feature de Part de la guerre. Such portions of the old walls as<lb facs="P26_TL00013"/>were allowed to remain would belong to the first quarter of the fourteenth century. This<lb facs="P26_TL00014"/>fourteenth=century wall was once studded with towers, most of which were razed in 1626=7,<lb facs="P26_TL00015"/>but a few everTyet remain. Above the walls we should see a host of towers, belonging to<lb facs="P26_TL00016"/>the palaces, monasteries, and churches of the City of the Lily, and chief among them those<lb facs="P26_TL00017"/>of the Duomo, Palazzo Vecchio, and the Podesta. r jg?<lb facs="P26_TL00018"/>jg?

The widow's house would probably be one of the many fourteenth=century<lb facs="P26_TL00022"/>houses with which Florence then abounded, and in its massive wooden# ceilings, with their<lb facs="P26_TL00023"/>faded and broken patches of colour, its unmoulded, (or scarcemoulded) arches, and its<lb facs="P26_TL00024"/>panelled walls, we might recognise the strong, almost solemn spirit of Arnolfo, the city<lb facs="P26_TL00025"/>architect of 1290=1310. &amp;<lb facs="P26_TL00026"/>A. D. 1555 introduces us to Henry II. of France, to Mary of England, and to the Emperor<lb facs="P26_TL00027"/>Charles V. Of the King of France (Henry II.), and what manner of man he was we may<lb facs="P26_TL00028"/>behold the vraisemblance in his portrait drawn at full length by Clouet, and now in the<lb facs="P26_TL00029"/>museum of the' Louvre. The engravings of Peressim (&lt;559) are replete with illustrations of<lb facs="P26_TL00030"/>the military costumes of France, from the plumed noble in embossed, chared or damascened<lb facs="P26_TL00031"/>armour, to the Swiss guard, vith his halberd, the arquebusier, the pikemen, and the Archers<lb facs="P26_TL00032"/>de la garde da roi. In the well=known portraits of Queen Mary and of Marie Stuart<lb facs="P26_TL00033"/>(Society of Antiquaries, London) we have sufficient authority for the fashion of the dress<lb facs="P26_TL00034"/>of the Countess of Rousillon, or the ladies of the Court of France. The colours most in<lb facs="P26_TL00035"/>vogue with the ladies of this period were crimson, violet, tan=co!our, golden yellow, straw<lb facs="P26_TL00036"/>yellow, and grey; these were used with great skill, and much was done by the Judicious<lb facs="P26_TL00037"/>employment of black and white for relief and emphasis. A severe costume combining only<lb facs="P26_TL00038"/>black and white with lines of gold embroidery was that adopted by the King at this time,<lb facs="P26_TL00039"/>and regarded as his livery. Bertram, Count of Rousillon, and the nobles of Southern and<lb facs="P26_TL00040"/>ultra Catholic France, would be far beyond their sovereign in richness and elaboration of<lb facs="P26_TL00041"/>apparel, wearing as an everyday costume crimson velvet or satin with embroideries and<lb facs="P26_TL00042"/>buttons of gold.

There would be nothing strange or unlikely, nor do I<lb facs="P31_TL00007"/>believe that one who should stop at these facts could be criticised as a simpleton. But all<lb facs="P31_TL00008"/>the same it is a fact that no one has stopped there 1 It hurt the eyes to see this personage,<lb facs="P31_TL00009"/>all white and spruce, a youth of scarcely three hundred years, and one wanted to surround<lb facs="P31_TL00010"/>him with a little archeologica! mildew. &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00011"/>&amp; The writer in a Neapolitan paper of 1839 called 'Lo Zibaldone', after having referred, in<lb facs="P31_TL00012"/>an article of his on Pulicinella, to the story of Fiorillo, exclaimed, "Oh, what modernity!<lb facs="P31_TL00013"/>" he would be a thousand times more precious, even if he were less droll, were he but more<lb facs="P31_TL00014"/>"ancient!" and he felt as though he had been born again when he knew that one of the<lb facs="P31_TL00015"/>antiquarians most in vogue, Bernardo Quaranta, Professor of Archeology in the University<lb facs="P31_TL00016"/>of Naples, had published a dissertation with which he proved that Pulicinella dates beck<lb facs="P31_TL00017"/>to the Atellanfan fables. But it was not true! Quaranta's dissertation was never published;<lb facs="P31_TL00018"/>perhaps, in MS it may exist among the heirs,.... perhaps ! &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00019"/>jg? But all the same, to date Pulicinella back to the exodia of buffoons was npt so new a<lb facs="P31_TL00020"/>thing 01* so entirely characteristic of Quaranta. The Italian, French and German critics had<lb facs="P31_TL00021"/>said and repeated It a century before. Even Doni, already cited, set in his time the name<lb facs="P31_TL00022"/>of Macco near that of Pulicinella; but afterwards Riccaboni, (1731), Flcoroni (1750), and<lb facs="P31_TL00023"/>Floge! (1788) went further and held our buffoon as certainly the continuer of the ancient<lb facs="P31_TL00024"/>mime. And from that time forward almost all, referring to Pulicinella, have considered him<lb facs="P31_TL00025"/>as a descendant of the Atellanian 'Macco'. &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00026"/>But if, then, Pulicinella descends from Macco, what do we know of this grotesque (2)<lb facs="P31_TL00027"/>person himself<lb facs="P31_TL00028"/>&amp; The Gramarian Diomede says, In Atellana (inducuntur) escae personae ut Maccus";<lb facs="P31_TL00029"/>and perhaps this actor played the part of the fool, because in Apuleio are these words:<lb facs="P31_TL00030"/>" Omnes 1st! quos nominavi, et si quis praeterea fuerunt dolo memorandi, si cum hac una<lb facs="P31_TL00031"/>" Rufini fallacia contendantur, macci prorsus et buccones videbuntur ". In some of the notes<lb facs="P31_TL00032"/>of the Atellanian fables handed on to us by other gramarians we find Macco mentioned:<lb facs="P31_TL00033"/>'Maccus caupo', 'Maccus miles', 'Maccus vurgo', 'Maccus sequester', 'Maccus exul'. And<lb facs="P31_TL00034"/>nothing beyond this, so far as I know, of the progenitor claimed for Pulicinella. Festo once<lb facs="P31_TL00035"/>speaks of a Mimus alhus ; and Fiogel immediately credits this as being the second name of<lb facs="P31_TL00036"/>Macco: " Macco or wfcite mime".<lb facs="P31_TL00037"/>In 1727, excavating on the Esquiline, there was discovered a bronze statuette with silver<lb facs="P31_TL00038"/>eyes, with two little globules of silver at the corners of the mouth, with a double hump<lb facs="P31_TL00039"/>before and behind, a large hanging nose and dressed in a short shirt reaching to above<lb facs="P31_TL00040"/>the knees. In that statuette Anton Francesco Gori claimed to distinguish Macco; and<lb facs="P31_TL00041"/>Flogel applauded the interpretation of the Italian archeologist, adding on his part, •' Whoever<lb facs="P31_TL00042"/>" is familiar with the story of the Roman buffoons can from its own aspect easily judge<lb facs="P31_TL00043"/>" that this must represent a buffoon ". And, having said this, he leaps to the conclusion<lb facs="P31_TL00044"/>in consequence, that the little statue represents the progenital prototype of our Puliclnalla.<lb facs="P31_TL00045"/>Klein, .. to speak of more recent things,... applauds also. "A. F. Gori recognised in the<lb facs="P31_TL00046"/>" little grotesque bronze figure which was dug up on the Esquiline, a comic Macco, who<lb facs="P31_TL00047"/>"has an obvious likeness with the Neapoiitan Pulicinella": but then he here makes a<lb facs="P31_TL00048"/>leap which would be pleasing if it were not so common in this ill=arranged book of his:<lb facs="P31_TL00049"/>" in any case, " he adds, " in any case a greater resemblance than the comic Roman Atellanian<lb facs="P31_TL00050"/>with the satiric Greek drama \" &amp; jgf &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00051"/>Giuseppe Micali, in a painting unearthed at Pompei in which the illustrator of the Bor=<lb facs="P31_TL00052"/>home Museum had believed he recognised a scene from the Miles gloriosus of Plautus,<lb facs="P31_TL00053"/>supposes instead that it may represent " a comic burlesque scene of the Maccus miles,</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P32_TL00003"/>a most celebrated Atellanian fable: in which case, he continues, one would have in this<lb facs="P32_TL00004"/>painting the masks of that famous Macco and of Btsco, legitimate progenitors of Pulicinella<lb facs="P32_TL00005"/>and of Zanii.<lb facs="P32_TL00006"/>&amp; And up to this point, fortunately, they had stopped short at the interpretation of a<lb facs="P32_TL00007"/>determined fact; but they passed on at once to generic affirmations. Schlegel after having<lb facs="P32_TL00008"/>said that the first germ of the 4Comedla dell'Arte' Is found in the 'Ateilane', continues :<lb facs="P32_TL00009"/>44 Arlecchino and Pulcinella would arouse certainly the greatest marvel in the world were<lb facs="P32_TL00010"/>44 it known that they descend in direct line (this is the 'gerader linie' of Flogel) from the<lb facs="P32_TL00011"/>44 ancient Romans and also from the Oscans, and this glorious lineage would inspire in them,<lb facs="P32_TL00012"/>44 without doubt, an alterigia burlesque. It is, however, certain that there are found on the<lb facs="P32_TL00013"/>44 ancient Greek vases, among the grotesque masquers, many costumes very similar to theirs,<lb facs="P32_TL00014"/>44 as, for example, wide breeches and a robe with sleeves, which costumes were as foreign<lb facs="P32_TL00015"/>44 for the Greeks as for the Romans ". And further on : 44 it is said that there has been <lb facs="P32_TL00016"/>44 vered among the fresco paintings at Pompei the figure of Pulcinella exactly similar to<lb facs="P32_TL00017"/>44 the Pulcinella of our times". <lb facs="P32_TL00018"/>j&amp; 44 It is said"? and by whom? and on what proofs? The good Tommaso Semmola, a<lb facs="P32_TL00019"/>worthy Neapolitan Greek scholar of the middle of the xix century, referring to a walk of his<lb facs="P32_TL00020"/>over the ruins of Suessola, proceeded to say, 44 As confirmation of the extreme antiquity of<lb facs="P32_TL00021"/>44 the character of Pulcinella it is helpful to us to consider that, as much in the excavations<lb facs="P32_TL00022"/>44 executed at Herculanium as in those already made at different times in the neighbourhood<lb facs="P32_TL00023"/>44 of Cum a, among the many very rare things there have been discovered many forms of<lb facs="P32_TL00024"/>44 masks made of clay, and among these there are some ugly and ridiculous ones which<lb facs="P32_TL00025"/>44 resemble Pulcinella. It might be argued from this that such a character is ancient, and<lb facs="P32_TL00026"/>44 that the Atellanians were perhaps the inventors of it". This coming down is curious I<lb facs="P32_TL00027"/>One begins by promising a proof to confirm the fact that the character of Pulcinella is<lb facs="P32_TL00028"/>44 most ancient" and one ends by proving that perhaps it is 44 ancient " ! But where are<lb facs="P32_TL00029"/>these 44 ugly and ridiculous " masks<lb facs="P32_TL00030"/>Absolutely ridiculous, again, is a discovery of Carlo Tito Dalbono: 44 We find," he says,<lb facs="P32_TL00031"/>44 in the ancient Herculaniun and Pompelan excavations remains of columns bearing at the<lb facs="P32_TL00032"/>44 top as capital a head with large ears, open mouth, and sometimes crowned with leaves,<lb facs="P32_TL00033"/>44 which from the forehead to beneath the nose is black, then white to the chin. And this<lb facs="P32_TL00034"/>44 species of mask has been adopted by the present clay workers as a flower vase. Here<lb facs="P32_TL00035"/>44 then is a face in two colours, in short a mask, but a permanent mask. And this is the<lb facs="P32_TL00036"/>44 mask of Pulcinella<lb facs="P32_TL00037"/>But in any case then Pulcinella boasts an ancient lineage ! And no one has opposed it<lb facs="P32_TL00038"/>because it was the universal desire and glory that the noble 'Cetru/o' family should date<lb facs="P32_TL00039"/>back even seventeen centuries and all have saluted with deference the genealogical tree<lb facs="P32_TL00040"/>with its ancient branches. Mommsen indicates the etymology of the word maccarone in<lb facs="P32_TL00041"/>the ancient name Maccus; and, speaking of the old Oscan farces does not hesitate to say<lb facs="P32_TL00042"/>destinctly, 44 pulzinellkomodien". A Barnabite lecturer also has wished to find summed<lb facs="P32_TL00043"/>up in Pulcinella all the characteristics of the ancient mimes; and one must give him<lb facs="P32_TL00044"/>credit for good will. 44 In our mask, he says, are reproduced, now one and now the other,<lb facs="P32_TL00045"/>44 all the distinctive variations of the ancient Mime, and these are: the shaven head which<lb facs="P32_TL00046"/>44 was the particular custom of the Sanniones; the stick, (which for Harlequin is changed<lb facs="P32_TL00047"/>44 for a spatula) sign of the curved cane of the characters of the ancient comedy, (and here<lb facs="P32_TL00048"/>44 is cited the 4Greek Literature' of Mulier); the foot covered by a light sandai usually of<lb facs="P32_TL00049"/>44 leather, without heel, which was the footgear of the Planipedi (one may cite the step of<lb facs="P32_TL00050"/>44 Biomede 4Planipes graece dicitur Mimus, ideo autem latine Planipes, quod actores plants<lb facs="P32_TL00051"/>44 pedibus, idest nudis, proscenium introirent; from which it is clear, instead, that the<lb facs="P32_TL00052"/>44 actors came on the stage barefoot) the hoarse and nasal voice, which is preserved entire<lb facs="P32_TL00053"/>44 in the Pulcinella of the Piazzas, a survival of the custom of the Latin rope dancers of<lb facs="P32_TL00054"/>44 speaking with little globules of silver under the mask". &amp;<lb facs="P32_TL00055"/>Certainly I too have seen Pulcinellas with shaven heads but never one who came upon<lb facs="P32_TL00056"/>the stage barefoot or with a wand. Nor should 1 know that the hoarse and nasal voice<lb facs="P32_TL00057"/>of the Pulcinella of today has its distant origin in the globules of silver which certainly<lb facs="P32_TL00058"/>Puicinella does not use now I To the purpose here is an ingenuous confession of a French</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P33_TL00002"/>Journalist of 1834: 44 Policinelle played in the Atelianians. He did not really wear the three<lb facs="P33_TL00003"/>44 cornered hat, unknown to the Romans; instead of the closefitting coat and smallclothes<lb facs="P33_TL00004"/>44 he was dressed in a tunic, and he wore buskins instead of sabots, which must have taken<lb facs="P33_TL00005"/>44 from him a good deal of his comic power: in compensation, at the two corners of his<lb facs="P33_TL00006"/>44 mouth tinkled two little silver balls ". &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P33_TL00007"/>Even this Oscan origin did not suffice and one incomparably older was assigned to Pul*<lb facs="P33_TL00008"/>cinella. Actually they discovered that the vaunted progenitor Maccus was himself only a<lb facs="P33_TL00009"/>descendant of the ancient Pulcinella I Yes, gentlemen: Pulcinella belonged to the ancient<lb facs="P33_TL00010"/>tribes of Israel I 44 Archeological researches appear to have established, according to some<lb facs="P33_TL00011"/>44 embossments and basrelief figures of ancient Egypt, that the first families of Israel who<lb facs="P33_TL00012"/>44 came transported into that country some little sculptures of Polichinelles which were<lb facs="P33_TL00013"/>44 given to Jacob's children to amuse them in their cradle And this article writer of the<lb facs="P33_TL00014"/>44 Magasin Pittoresque " in 1834 only repeated that which from 1812 Millin had said in the<lb facs="P33_TL00015"/>Magasin Encyclopedique. And in 1843 a German, Hebenstreit, after having affirmed that<lb facs="P33_TL00016"/>44 undoubtedly that personage is a modification of an ancient mask" also repeated the<lb facs="P33_TL00017"/>Israelitish origin. But, for what I know, this hypothesis has had no luck; perhaps it seems<lb facs="P33_TL00018"/>a little rash even to the enemies of 44 modernity<lb facs="P33_TL00019"/>Who, therefore is our Pulcinella, and how, where and when was he born ?<lb facs="P33_TL00020"/>It is Important to us to ascertain his original. Millin's phrase 44 what do the origin and<lb facs="P33_TL00021"/>genealogy of Pulcinella matter so long as he is gay and amusing " makes us smile with<lb facs="P33_TL00022"/>compassion. And we are not satisfied by the sonorous but empty words of the canon De<lb facs="P33_TL00023"/>Jorio, 44 his great grandfather, the origin of his descent, is beyond history and enfolded in<lb facs="P33_TL00024"/>the obscurity of fable ". We want proofs, we want precision and certainty in the facts<lb facs="P33_TL00025"/>even in this question of Pulcinella! <lb facs="P33_TL00026"/>&amp; Frankly, the real story of the origin of Pulcinella seems to be this:... In the last years<lb facs="P33_TL00027"/>of the 16th century, among the many players who in those days invaded the piazzas of the<lb facs="P33_TL00028"/>Italian cities, there was one who was either a peasant, or wished to counterfeit the peasants,<lb facs="P33_TL00029"/>of Acerra. Perhaps he was a countryman gifted with a happy comic and satiric vein but<lb facs="P33_TL00030"/>to whom the work of a peasant was less pleasing than his buffooneries, and he came to<lb facs="P33_TL00031"/>town and earned his living by stirring up the good humour of the porters and waiting<lb facs="P33_TL00032"/>maids of the Piazza Pendino. He kept to his smock of white linen or pulled out his shirt<lb facs="P33_TL00033"/>over his trousers as the boys of the people do when they want to play at soldiers; clasped<lb facs="P33_TL00034"/>his leather belt and fastened there, instead of the big knife or 4smarazzola' a short broad<lb facs="P33_TL00035"/>sword as we have seen in Callot's picture. Afterwards a talented comedian, Silvio Fiorillo,<lb facs="P33_TL00036"/>who had already rendered himself famous as 4Capitan Matamoros' took that popular type<lb facs="P33_TL00037"/>and from it made a creation of his own. &amp;<lb facs="P33_TL00038"/>&amp; And this story finds its confirmation in the extracts cited at the biginning from those<lb facs="P33_TL00039"/>almost contemporaneous with Fiorillo,.... Giambattista Doni, Giambattista Pacichelli and<lb facs="P33_TL00040"/>Andrea Perrucci; and in one legend, not yet extinct, which was recounted with his usual<lb facs="P33_TL00041"/>comic flavour, by the abbot Galiani. I give it from the French versian, not having been able<lb facs="P33_TL00042"/>to see the original: 44 In the last century there was in Acerra, a city of the Happy Country,<lb facs="P33_TL00043"/>44 a troup of comedians who wandered about the province to earn something. One day they<lb facs="P33_TL00044"/>44 emerged on a country where the peasants were gathering the vintage. As on that occasion<lb facs="P33_TL00045"/>44 one drank more than usual and men and women worked together the gaiety was animated<lb facs="P33_TL00046"/>44 and each passer-by received a joke. The comedians saw themselves in their turn exposed<lb facs="P33_TL00047"/>44to the raillery of the vintagers; but, inured to this exercise, they began to reply and to<lb facs="P33_TL00048"/>44 give back sally for sally. Now, among the villagers there was one named Puccio d'Aniello,<lb facs="P33_TL00049"/>44 with a comical face, long nose, and swarthy skin ; facetious, moreover, and of a sharp<lb facs="P33_TL00050"/>44 Wit". A<lb facs="P33_TL00051"/>The comedians set themselves to amuse themselves specially with him, and he redoubled<lb facs="P33_TL00052"/>his jests and banter. No one wished to give in, and they struggled who should make most<lb facs="P33_TL00053"/>fun of the other; the repartis became sharper; to jokes succeeded cries and hoots; it was<lb facs="P33_TL00054"/>a regular Finally, the countryman got the best of it, and the comedians, ashamed,<lb facs="P33_TL00055"/>decided to retire and returned to town astonished. Having recovered from their emotions,<lb facs="P33_TL00056"/>they, according to the custom of theatrical folk who draw advantage from everything,<lb facs="P33_TL00057"/>thought they could do good business if they engaged in their company this peasant whom</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P34_TB00006">
                                    <lb facs="P34_TL00007"/>they had found so facetious and so witty; therefore they made a proposal to him and he<lb facs="P34_TL00008"/>accepted it. They strolled the country with their new buffoon who succeeded wonderfully<lb facs="P34_TL00009"/>and won admittance everywhere by his witticisms, to which contributed also his droll<lb facs="P34_TL00010"/>physique and his country bearing,.... that is to say, his shirt and trousers of white linen. The<lb facs="P34_TL00011"/>troupe earned much and the name of Puccio d'Aniello was celebrated. At the end of some<lb facs="P34_TL00012"/>years Puccio died ; but then the comedians replaced him by a companion who appeared in<lb facs="P34_TL00013"/>the same costume and the same mask. lie kept also the old name, but in a modulated form<lb facs="P34_TL00014"/>and was called 4Polecenella\ Other comedians followed the example, and soon the mask of<lb facs="P34_TL00015"/>Poleceneila spread over all the theatres of Italy and Europe, (i)<lb facs="P34_TL00016"/>&amp; However the finding of Pulcinella on the same soil where once flourished the Atellanian<lb facs="P34_TL00017"/>fables is a fact which justifies others in thinking of a historical connection between the<lb facs="P34_TL00018"/>two dramatic apparitions. Doubtless these coincidences in such distant times are a proof<lb facs="P34_TL00019"/>to us of the continuity of the genius of race and it would be absurd to deny the ethnogra®<lb facs="P34_TL00020"/>phical connection. The same Galiani, in recounting the legend, 44 seems to believe " says<lb facs="P34_TL00021"/>Saint Beuve, (2) 44 that the spirit of these ancient farces has been able to perpetuate itself In<lb facs="P34_TL00022"/>the modern original". Also, to explain the apparition of the 4farse cavaiole', some, like<lb facs="P34_TL00023"/>Minturno, at once had recourse to the old Oscan comedies. (3) But between these and the<lb facs="P34_TL00024"/>first appearance of Pulcinella intervenes a space of seventeen centuries I &amp; &lt;£? jg?<lb facs="P34_TL00025"/>&amp; What during this long period has become of Macco, of Pappo, of Bucco, of Manduco? what<lb facs="P34_TL00026"/>of their farces ? Let us search cautiously to retrace, if it be possible, some vestige of the<lb facs="P34_TL00027"/>old comedy in the thick fog of the intervening time. &amp;<lb facs="P34_TL00028"/>In the heart of our provinces, in Carneval, they yet represent farces with fixed types,<lb facs="P34_TL00029"/>and sometimes 4a soggetto'. Now, might these not be yet living relics of the Atellanian<lb facs="P34_TL00030"/>plays? Could not these primitive forms of drama, saved from all literary influence by their<lb facs="P34_TL00031"/>distance from the large cities, indicate to us what was, generally, the popular comedy of<lb facs="P34_TL00032"/>the middle ages ? Among the people, especially in the country, traditions are faithfully<lb facs="P34_TL00033"/>maintained, and many of the peasant dramatic forms yet living might be the repetition of<lb facs="P34_TL00034"/>the ancient Oscan farces. The Commedia delPArte might really have been generated in<lb facs="P34_TL00035"/>these rustic farces ; and Pulcinella, a peasant of Gifoni in the Principality of Acerra in the<lb facs="P34_TL00036"/>Campania, might have represented the part which his great grandfather Macco had created.<lb facs="P34_TL00037"/>And as he from his native Atella came to represent the peasant 'exodia' at Rome in company<lb facs="P34_TL00038"/>with many compatriots, so Pulcinella, from his native village, might have come one fine<lb facs="P34_TL00039"/>day into the neighbourhood of Salerno or Naples, and there, fascinated by the success<lb facs="P34_TL00040"/>obtained with his Oscan witticisms have drawn around him those other peasants with whom,<lb facs="P34_TL00041"/>in the country, he had acted the peasant farces, and have repeated them in the city amidst the<lb facs="P34_TL00042"/>hearty laughter of the people. Each of those peasant actors, little by little, took to continually<lb facs="P34_TL00043"/>representing a particular comic character corresponding to the ancient Bucco or to Pappo<lb facs="P34_TL00044"/>or to Manduco ; and thus the fixed types were created, which afterwards by degrees, by<lb facs="P34_TL00045"/>means of successive actors of a certain culture, were developed and finally remodelled on<lb facs="P34_TL00046"/>the classic originals of Plautus and Terence.<lb facs="P34_TL00047"/>&amp; But these, however probable, are only suppositions. (4) &amp;<lb facs="P34_TL00048"/>An almost certain Indication of the existence of PuScinelSa, even before the time in which<lb facs="P34_TL00049"/>he appears in Callot's picture, could be found in some sketch, whether by those skilled or<lb facs="P34_TL00050"/>not in the art of drawing, representing him. We have, however, no coliection of this kind,<lb facs="P34_TL00051"/>but an Investigation might be attempted in the old books and illustrated catalogues of the<lb facs="P34_TL00052"/>museums.<lb facs="P34_TL00053"/>First of all, the discovery in the Campania of a figure dressed like Pulcinella must not<lb facs="P34_TL00054"/>make us at once cry out 44 Eureka! " Turning over the great volumes on the antiquities of<lb facs="P34_TL00055"/>Herculanium we meet at every step with short togas reaching to the knee and fastened at<lb facs="P34_TL00056"/>the waist with a leather strap. Again, in the bronzes there is a little idol as ornament of<lb facs="P34_TL00057"/>a votive hand, which has even the hat in the style of a 'cappolone V And on the other hand<lb facs="P34_TL00058"/>even now the country peasants dress, for their rustic work, like Pulcinella. Travelling</ab>
                                 <ab facs="P35_TB00003">
                                    <lb facs="P35_TL00003"/>along the railway line from Napoli to Nola you will find the district of Acerra peopled by<lb facs="P35_TL00004"/>many Pulcinellas !<lb facs="P35_TL00005"/>*&lt;&amp;■ On a column excavated at Pompei was found, engraved with a nail, a little figure of<lb facs="P35_TL00006"/>which the dress and movement of the hands have much likeness to Pulcinella. Above is<lb facs="P35_TL00007"/>written, "Ad amphitheatr Francesco Maria Avellino, who commented on that graphite,<lb facs="P35_TL00008"/>says " By his short clothes and the movement of the head and arms one would believe him<lb facs="P35_TL00009"/>"at the first glance a comedian or a poet who is declaiming. But the inscription above,<lb facs="P35_TL00010"/>" which reads 'Ad amphitheatrum' seems to forbid the adoption of such an explanation and<lb facs="P35_TL00011"/>"we therefore believe that it may be, in whatever manner expressed, one of the spectators<lb facs="P35_TL00012"/>" applauding in the amphitheatre his favourite gladiators. " (i) &amp; &lt;£?<lb facs="P35_TL00013"/>&amp; This explanation does not succeed in persuading me. To me it seems that this figure<lb facs="P35_TL00014"/>may rather represent one of those buffoons that they put over the doors of the little theatres<lb facs="P35_TL00015"/>of our Molo, to call together the people; and that "Ad amphitheatrum" would exactly<lb facs="P35_TL00016"/>correspond to our " Tickets!" And much the same as this was thought also by Finati, col«<lb facs="P35_TL00017"/>league of Avellino in the Academy of Herculaneum, (2) &amp;<lb facs="P35_TL00018"/>&amp; Of far greater importance for us is an earthenware sherd, on which is shaped a head<lb facs="P35_TL00019"/>in basrelief, the portrait of Pulcinella. The large aquiline nose, the hump in front, the air<lb facs="P35_TL00020"/>of an idiot, the projecting cheek bones, and even the half mask to the level of the mouth,<lb facs="P35_TL00021"/>nothing is wanting. But of what date is the terra cotta ? where was it excavated ? Nothing<lb facs="P35_TL00022"/>is told us ; The commentator is too much occupied in holding forth on the preadamite origin<lb facs="P35_TL00023"/>of the art of potting, and he gets rid of us by writing under the picture where Pulcinella's<lb facs="P35_TL00024"/>head is copied, this simple motto, " small Italian plastic figures of buffoon type ", and we<lb facs="P35_TL00025"/>remain with that sherd in our hands, without knowing how to attribute any value to it!<lb facs="P35_TL00026"/>After all, it is not improbable that a comic Atellanian tradition may have survived, more<lb facs="P35_TL00027"/>or less evident, in the Campania up to the appearance of Pulcinella. Proofs are lacking to<lb facs="P35_TL00028"/>assert that he really descends in direct line from Macco and are lacking in like manner to<lb facs="P35_TL00029"/>affirm that, unconsciously, he may have known how to make the Oscan spirit live again as<lb facs="P35_TL00030"/>all would have us believe. But it is certain, however, that the modern Pulcinella was born<lb facs="P35_TL00031"/>in the 16th century and that only from that time has he assumed an individual character;<lb facs="P35_TL00032"/>which Cerlone completed, with artistic skill, towards the end of the last century. &amp;<lb facs="P35_TL00033"/>Pulcinella was amongst our first buffoons to pass the Alps and his name was translated<lb facs="P35_TL00034"/>by the French into Polichinelle, by the English Into Punch, by the Spaniards into Pulichinelo,<lb facs="P35_TL00035"/>by the Germans into Pulzinella. But in France they made him change his appearance, gave<lb facs="P35_TL00036"/>him two humps, one in front, the other behind, and dressed him in a fine dress and a three<lb facs="P35_TL00037"/>cornered hat, and he was a child's toy. They also wanted to attribute to him a less peasant<lb facs="P35_TL00038"/>origin ; among the laces of the elegant little figure the musty smell of the countryman<lb facs="P35_TL00039"/>displeased them ! Listen to the story, as Octave Feuillet recounts it to the little readers of<lb facs="P35_TL00040"/>the " Petite bibliotheque blanche." (3) &amp; <lb facs="P35_TL00041"/>&amp; " The sailor Pulci and his wife were in despair because they had 110 son. One evening<lb facs="P35_TL00042"/>" he swore loudly and she called for the assistance of the Madonna. All of a sudden there<lb facs="P35_TL00043"/>6t came from under the bed a cat black as soot and rushed upon the sailor, and in the same mo<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The<lb facs="P35_TL00045"/>" woman ran to look and found there a little monster, with two humps and with a nose<lb facs="P35_TL00046"/>" like a parrot's beak arching over a mouth so wide that it reached to his ears. This magot,<lb facs="P35_TL00047"/>"it was our hero himself, the illustrious PuIcineSlo, who later, through love for you, my<lb facs="P35_TL00048"/>" child, changed his name to Polichinelle, so that you might more easily be able to pronounce<lb facs="P35_TL00049"/>" the name or your friend." No sooner had he grown biggish than he wanted to go to Court.<lb facs="P35_TL00050"/>" Having a hump, said he, both " behind and before, it Is good that I learn to read and<lb facs="P35_TL00051"/>" write ; if it please God I shall become a learned man and I shall have so much wit that<lb facs="P35_TL00052"/>"my humps and my ugliness will no longer be seen." And at the Court, for his witty<lb facs="P35_TL00053"/>tricks, he was dear to the king, but hated to death by the Majordomo, M. Ernest du Bugolin,<lb facs="P35_TL00054"/>whom he often made an object of ridicule. By having defended Naples from an army of a<lb facs="P35_TL00055"/>hundred thousand English he aroused the jealosy of the king, and, if it had not been for</ab>

There he was led before<lb facs="P36_TL00013"/>the commissioner, who was,... guess! the very captain Ronflard himself!

And every evening he<lb facs="P36_TL00024"/>set himself with gusto to beat that longnosed traitor; and daily from Paris, on the cat's<lb facs="P36_TL00025"/>tail, he took a flight to Naples to amuse his fellow citizens. Once he returned sad, and his<lb facs="P36_TL00026"/>good humour was veiled by a cloud of melancholy; he had fallen in love with Columbine,<lb facs="P36_TL00027"/>the daughter of Pantaloon.

Others have said that it is derived<lb facs="P36_TL00039"/>from one Paolo CinelH, altered by the pronunciation of the French who came to Naples.<lb facs="P36_TL00040"/>But here also, Paolo Cinelli would give, in the French pronunciation, a 4PolsineIIi' which<lb facs="P36_TL00041"/>at most could have transformed itself in Napolitan into Puzeniello, like Polsino is transformed<lb facs="P36_TL00042"/>into Puzino.

If they did not feel this they would take many more years to consider the<lb facs="P38_TL00038"/>question, " How to act in the open air and what is the difference of such acting from that<lb facs="P38_TL00039"/>destined for a roofed theatre " ; and this question leads up to so many other questions that<lb facs="P38_TL00040"/>very few persons are able to answer them today, and certainly not in a hurry.<lb facs="P38_TL00041"/>&amp; So is it with the Dance. What is its actual relationship to the theatre, and, considering<lb facs="P38_TL00042"/>our first question, its relation to the theatre of the open air in distinction to the roofed-in<lb facs="P38_TL00043"/>theatre ? No one can hastily don a few Egyptian clothes and, relying upon their personality,<lb facs="P38_TL00044"/>come before the world and claim to have discovered a new theatre in a pas-seul. Dance<lb facs="P38_TL00045"/>may or may not have its place in the Art of the Theatre ; most probably it has not; but<lb facs="P38_TL00046"/>this cannot be decided in a hurry. &amp;<lb facs="P38_TL00047"/>With painted Scenery and with the lighting of this modern Scene the same judgement<lb facs="P38_TL00048"/>has to be passed. You may not claim to have discovered the new Art of the Theatre on the<lb facs="P38_TL00049"/>score that you have designed and lighted some mysterious scenes.<lb facs="P38_TL00050"/>Again because you have dealt with the new Socialistic questions of the day you must not<lb facs="P38_TL00051"/>believe that you have created a new drama. jZ? jz?

                                    <lb facs="P39_TL00005"/>character of the Negro, as exhibited on the stage, is a strange compound of physical<lb facs="P39_TL00006"/>and moral singularities, that are well worthy the attention of the student of human<lb facs="P39_TL00007"/>nature in its dramatic, which is certainly its most astounding form. The Stage Negro seems<lb facs="P39_TL00008"/>to be deeply imbued with the beauties of the British Constitution, and is constantly<lb facs="P39_TL00009"/>indulging in sentiments of gratitude towards England, that must be delighful to the ears<lb facs="P39_TL00010"/>of the most patriotic native of our highly-favoured isle. The Stage Negro is continually<lb facs="P39_TL00011"/>running about in an ecstasy ot delight at the reflection, that, " dreckly him put him foot<lb facs="P39_TL00012"/>on British groun, him free as de air, free as Massa himself: " an announcement which Is<lb facs="P39_TL00013"/>usually followed up in an early scene by the Negro receiving a variety of cuffs or kicks<lb facs="P39_TL00014"/>(in which, by=th©=bye, he seems to delight) from some of the other characters in the drama.<lb facs="P39_TL00015"/>&amp; Sometimes the Stage Negro grows sentimental, and asks, in reference to some cruel prac<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P39_TL00016"/>tical joke that has been played upon him, uWhether him not a man and a brother; for<lb facs="P39_TL00017"/>though him face black as him coal, him heart white as him lily. " The old constitution-loving<lb facs="P39_TL00018"/>and sentiment-spluttering Stage Nigger is however rapidly disappearing from the stage ;<lb facs="P39_TL00019"/>and we get, in these days, very few of those cutting allusions to the traffic in slaves, and<lb facs="P39_TL00020"/>those tender appeals to the equality of the human race which were the charm of the dramatic<lb facs="P39_TL00021"/>negroes of our infancy. The Stage Negro has become a vulgar dancing brute, with a banjo<lb facs="P39_TL00022"/>in his hand, and without a bit of sentiment at his heart; a wretch constantly jumping about,<lb facs="P39_TL00023"/>wheeling about, and turning about, wholly devoid of that solemn admiration for the British<lb facs="P39_TL00024"/>Constitution and for the liberating influence of the sands at Margate, or the shingles at<lb facs="P39_TL00025"/>Dover which we once used to hear with a feeling of pride at being natives of a land that<lb facs="P39_TL00026"/>admitted of so much puffing on the part of our dramatist. The Stage Negro of the present<lb facs="P39_TL00027"/>day can only indulge in frivolous allusions to Miss Lucy Long, Coal Black Rose, and other<lb facs="P39_TL00028"/>light characters, or call upon some imaginary individual, of the name of Josey, to Jim<lb facs="P39_TL00029"/>along—a process that we are utterly at a loss to form any conception of.<lb facs="P39_TL00030"/>&amp; Thus much for the moral attributes of the Stage Negro, whose physical peculiarities<lb facs="P39_TL00031"/>remain, for the most part, unchanged ; and to these we can, therefore, turn our attention<lb facs="P39_TL00032"/>without any feeling of disappointment, at the alteration which has occured in the intellectual<lb facs="P39_TL00033"/>character. The Stage Negro still exhibits that remarkable peculiarity of the skin, which is<lb facs="P39_TL00034"/>shown by the dark colour, generally finishing abruptly at the wrist, the hand being perfectly<lb facs="P39_TL00035"/>the same as that of one of the white population.

                                    <lb facs="P39_TL00036"/>able ; for while the arm is of the colour of a black worsted stocking, the face is somewhat<lb facs="P39_TL00037"/>less opaque, and, indeed, it would appear that Nature dealt for her blacking with two<lb facs="P39_TL00038"/>different manufacturers, trying Warren for the limbs, and using Day and Martin for the<lb facs="P39_TL00039"/>features of the Stage Negro. &amp;&amp;&amp;&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;£? &amp;</ab>

While, however, she gains a knowledge<lb facs="P40_TL00020"/>of the heavy man's plans, and accepts from him at every interview a heavy purse filled<lb facs="P40_TL00021"/>with gallery checks, as a reward for her exertions in his behalf; the stage ladies'-maid is<lb facs="P40_TL00022"/>urging her young mistress to rush into the threadbare arms of a half-pay captain who<lb facs="P40_TL00023"/>makes love to her, by whistliftg up at the window, following her into the Park, kissing<lb facs="P40_TL00024"/>her maid, and practising other elegant little arts which military men—on the stage—are<lb facs="P40_TL00025"/>ordinarily addicted to. Perhaps, however, the most curious portion of the stage ladies'-maid's<lb facs="P40_TL00026"/>conduct is her treatment of the master of the house, whom she keeps in a state of conti<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P40_TL00027"/>nual subjection, by an uninterrupted course of insult and violence. She ordinarily addresses<lb facs="P40_TL00028"/>him as an old hunks, shakes her fist in his face, thrusts his hat and cane into his hand,—<lb facs="P40_TL00029"/>all the while pushing him towards the door,—when she has any purpose to serve by getting<lb facs="P40_TL00030"/>rid of him. If he begins to talk, she talks him down, so that he can only splutter and say<lb facs="P40_TL00031"/>" Whew," but he never thinks of either giving her a month's warning, or paying her<lb facs="P40_TL00032"/>wages, and sending her about her business. The stage ladies'-maid never thinks of leaving<lb facs="P40_TL00033"/>the drawing-room when visitors are present, but often remains in it alone to sing a song<lb facs="P40_TL00034"/>with Swiss variations, which must be heard all over the house to the great disturbance of<lb facs="P40_TL00035"/>the family. In dress she always excels her mistress, and frequently wears very thin white<lb facs="P40_TL00036"/>muslin over pink satin, the muslin being open all the way down the back, and an apron<lb facs="P40_TL00037"/>with pockets of very recherche embroidery.<lb facs="P40_TL00038"/>In conclusion she generally marries somebody because " she don't see why she shouldn't<lb facs="P40_TL00039"/>do as her young mistress does;" and she sometimes unites herself to a low-comic country<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

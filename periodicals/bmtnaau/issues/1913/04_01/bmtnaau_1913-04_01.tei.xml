But we are all beginning to see that<lb facs="P14_TL00007"/>he is an irresistible success and was a success in 1856 when he first<lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>published " Leaves of Grass ". We have had just such a giant in Europe<lb facs="P14_TL00009"/>once upon a time Leonardo da Vinci.

He was laughed at by that far too " successful "<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>gentleman, Michel Angelo.

He worked slowly and never would<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>he go further than the natural point in a slow development. He knew<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>that things have to grow, whereas Mr Binyon thinks they have to be<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>produced out of a hat. Let us take Leonardo and Whitman as the two<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>great masters of Europe and America and let us abide by their method,<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>for it is the method of Nature.

                                    <lb facs="P19_TL00003"/>Jf there is a great woman in Europe it is Prau Wagner. She triumphs,<lb facs="P19_TL00004"/>and without noise. She does not have to be photographed in her coffin<lb facs="P19_TL00005"/>nor to carry about mules with her on her journeys in order to attract<lb facs="P19_TL00006"/>attention. The great are ready to listen to her slightest word. I should<lb facs="P19_TL00007"/>say that she is quite unique. £?<lb facs="P19_TL00008"/>Her husband dies, bequeathing her a vast responsibility. His works<lb facs="P19_TL00009"/>have not to be treated in a commonplace manner, but have to be held up<lb facs="P19_TL00010"/>as unique. This she has achieved, and every woman should tender to her<lb facs="P19_TL00011"/>in her latest triumph appreciation of what she has done for the real<lb facs="P19_TL00012"/>cause of women.<lb facs="P19_TL00013"/>When It was announced that "Parsifal" would be' produced by M.<lb facs="P19_TL00014"/>Qunsbourg at Montecarlo everyone believed that the influence was so<lb facs="P19_TL00015"/>great around M. Qunsbourg that M. Qunsbourg would be allowed to do<lb facs="P19_TL00016"/>what he premeditated. &amp; &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00017"/>At the last moment, however, and without giving any more effort to<lb facs="P19_TL00018"/>it than most people would give to taking a morning stroll, Madame<lb facs="P19_TL00019"/>Wagner arrives at the Riviera. Within forty eight hours the Prince of<lb facs="P19_TL00020"/>X.<lb facs="P19_TL00021"/>Monaco refuses to allow the performance to take place. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P19_TL00022"/>Madame Wagner then does not abuse her triumph, but is generous<lb facs="P19_TL00023"/>enough to make a concession. She allows a rehearsal to be witnessed<lb facs="P19_TL00024"/>by those people who were evidently hoping to make thousands out<lb facs="P19_TL00025"/>of it. &lt;o<lb facs="P19_TL00026"/>&amp; A little more of this quiet but tremendous spirit among the women<lb facs="P19_TL00027"/>who are so loudly advocating women's rights, and the world would be<lb facs="P19_TL00028"/>a very much grander place than it is at present.<lb facs="P19_TL00029"/>It is absolutely right that " Parsifal " should only be heard in Bey=«<lb facs="P19_TL00030"/>reuth. It is one of the common and stupid ideas of modern life that a<lb facs="P19_TL00031"/>man's work becomes public property when once it has been heard or<lb facs="P19_TL00032"/>seen. This stupidity of course comes from the grasping nature of certain<lb facs="P19_TL00033"/>business people and from the vanity of certain others. <lb facs="P19_TL00034"/>jg? These vain creatures want to be the patrons of that which is in no<lb facs="P19_TL00035"/>way connected with them, so they get a business man hot on the scene,<lb facs="P19_TL00036"/>and think the trick is done. &amp;</ab>

Before long<lb facs="P20_TL00004"/>an artist's work will be protected nut only during his life time and for<lb facs="P20_TL00005"/>a few score years after, but for the whole time that his family<lb facs="P20_TL00006"/>exists. &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00007"/>There is nothing but what is perfectly just and straightforward In<lb facs="P20_TL00008"/>such a reservation. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00009"/>Any man on earth who builds a castle on land which belongs to him<lb facs="P20_TL00010"/>is the sole proprietor of that castle, it passes on to his heirs at his death<lb facs="P20_TL00011"/>and his family may keep it so long as that family exists. <lb facs="P20_TL00012"/>The work of the artist is even more his own personal property, and<lb facs="P20_TL00013"/>it is very good to see all over the world steps being taken to make this<lb facs="P20_TL00014"/>clear. Once this very simple fact becomes evident to all nothing will<lb facs="P20_TL00015"/>ever be heard again of the incapacity of the artist to provide for himself<lb facs="P20_TL00016"/>during his lifetime and for his family after. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P20_TL00017"/>&amp; Nor is there only one side to this question. Both the artist and the<lb facs="P20_TL00018"/>public would benefit. At present works of art, especially those of famous<lb facs="P20_TL00019"/>men, are fabulously expensive. But, if the artist retained full rights over<lb facs="P20_TL00020"/>them during his fife and the life of his family, works of art would then<lb facs="P20_TL00021"/>become very cheap and the world would have more of them. See how<lb facs="P20_TL00022"/>excellent it would be. £/ ■£/<lb facs="P20_TL00023"/>&amp; If, on the contrary, the modern state of affairs goes on much longer<lb facs="P20_TL00024"/>the price of artists' works will rise and rise. That is to say, no one will<lb facs="P20_TL00025"/>be able to get a portrait or a landscape or any similar work of art under<lb facs="P20_TL00026"/>about two hundred thousand pounds. That sum properly invested would<lb facs="P20_TL00027"/>provide the artist's family with what it would want In future. But this<lb facs="P20_TL00028"/>would also rob the world of hundreds of thousands of works of art. If<lb facs="P20_TL00029"/>the public don't want to be robbed of their works of art they had<lb facs="P20_TL00030"/>better hasten forward the legislation in regard to the reservation of<lb facs="P20_TL00031"/>these works and the more quickly and the more actively this is set<lb facs="P20_TL00032"/>about the better. ...Other journals, please copy 1</ab>

A new Caesar stalked through the streets of risen<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>Rome, and with purple sail and flute-led oars another Cleopatra passed<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>up the river to Antioch. Old myth and legend and dream took shape and<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>substance. History was entirely re-written, and there was hardly one of<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>the dramatists who did not recognise that the object of Art Is not simple<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>truth but complex beauty. In this they were perfectly right.

As<lb facs="P22_TL00022"/>the inevitable result of this substitution of an imitative for a creative<lb facs="P22_TL00023"/>medium, this surrender of an imaginative form, we have the modern<lb facs="P22_TL00024"/>English melodrama. The characters in these plays talk on the stage<lb facs="P22_TL00025"/>exactly as they would talk off it; they have neither aspirations nor<lb facs="P22_TL00026"/>aspirates; they are taken directly from life and reproduce its vulgarity<lb facs="P22_TL00027"/>down to the smallest detail; they present the gait, manner, costume,<lb facs="P22_TL00028"/>and accent of real people ; they pass unoticed in a third-class railway<lb facs="P22_TL00029"/>carriage. And yet how wearisome the plays are ! They do not succeed in<lb facs="P22_TL00030"/>producing even that impression of reality at which they aim, and, which is<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>their only reason for existing.

                                    <lb facs="P47_TL00003"/>*Jphe love for the acting of burattini, or puppets, is universal among the<lb facs="P47_TL00004"/>lower classes throughout Italy, and in some cities, especially in Genoa,<lb facs="P47_TL00005"/>no pains are spared in their costume, construction, and movement, to<lb facs="P47_TL00006"/>render them life-like. &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; <lb facs="P47_TL00007"/>n°t allow yourself to suppose that there is anything ludicrous<lb facs="P47_TL00008"/>to the audience In the performances of these wooden burattini. Nothing,<lb facs="P47_TL00009"/>on the contrary, is more serious. No human being could be so serious.<lb facs="P47_TL00010"/>Their countenances are solemn as death and more unchanging than the<lb facs="P47_TL00011"/>face of a clock. Their terrible gravity when, with drooping heads and<lb facs="P47_TL00012"/>collapsed arms, they fix on you their great goggle eyes is at times<lb facs="P47_TL00013"/>ghastly. They never descend into the regions of conscious farce. The<lb facs="P47_TL00014"/>plays they perform are mostly heroic, romantic and historical. They<lb facs="P47_TL00015"/>stoop to nothing which is not startling in incident, imposing in style<lb facs="P47_TL00016"/>and grandiose in movement. The wars of the Paladins, the heroic<lb facs="P47_TL00017"/>adventures of knights and ladies of romance, the tragedies of the middle<lb facs="P47_TL00018"/>ages, the prodigies of the melodramatic world, are within their special<lb facs="P47_TL00019"/>province. The heroes that tread the " fantoccini " stage are doughty<lb facs="P47_TL00020"/>warriors, who perform impossible feats of prowess, slay armies with a<lb facs="P47_TL00021"/>single arm, rescue Injured damsels, express themselves in loud and<lb facs="P47_TL00022"/>boastful language, utter exalted sentiments, and are equally admirable<lb facs="P47_TL00023"/>in love and war. No worthy " iantoccino " shrinks before an army, or<lb facs="P47_TL00024"/>leaves the boards of battle till it is covered with the corpses of his<lb facs="P47_TL00025"/>enemies. <lb facs="P47_TL00026"/>■£? The audience listen with grave and profound Interest. To them the<lb facs="P47_TL00027"/>actors are not " fantoccini " but heroes. Their inflated aad extravagant<lb facs="P47_TL00028"/>discourse Is simply grand and noble.

It was 44 sempre battaglia. " The scene when we<lb facs="P48_TL00019"/>entered was between two puppets, both dressed in armour, speaking in<lb facs="P48_TL00020"/>tremendous voices, and flourishing gigantic swords. One was a child-<lb facs="P48_TL00021"/>Fantoccino, the other probably Selinguerra.<lb facs="P48_TL00022"/>jg/ Each 44 Fantoccino " when it spoke went into a sudden convulsion<lb facs="P48_TL00023"/>as if it were attacked by a fit of St. Vitus's dance, while the sword seemed<lb facs="P48_TL00024"/>animated with spasmodic life, and thrashed to and fro in the air with<lb facs="P48_TL00025"/>utter disregard to the warrior's anatomy, which it constantly and<lb facs="P48_TL00026"/>painfully dislocated with every movement. But no sooner had he ceased<lb facs="P48_TL00027"/>speaking than his arms fell into a helpless collapse, his head dropped<lb facs="P48_TL00028"/>drunkenly forward, or remained fixed in a dislocation glaring at nothing,<lb facs="P48_TL00029"/>and with his sword stiffly pointing up to the ceiling, and his legs hanging<lb facs="P48_TL00030"/>in the air or huddled under him, so as to leave him quite out of balance,<lb facs="P48_TL00031"/>he awaited impotently the answer of his opponent. JE? &amp;<lb facs="P48_TL00032"/>It was a violent dispute that was taking place between the youth and<lb facs="P48_TL00033"/>Selinguerra and his lieutenant, who were threatening to destroy the<lb facs="P48_TL00034"/>castle of the 44 terribil Gobbo ".

                                    <lb facs="P49_TL00003"/>The dispute was tremendous. They launched at each other, in loud voices,<lb facs="P49_TL00004"/>terrible threats and challenges.

All the while a drum behind the scenes was 44 rolling rapidly ". It<lb facs="P49_TL00020"/>was encouraging to see how bravely the son of Gobbo held his own.<lb facs="P49_TL00021"/>Despite the terrible blows he received on his head, each of which would<lb facs="P49_TL00022"/>have done for ever a. mere 44 personaggio ", and the excited efforts he<lb facs="P49_TL00023"/>made with his arms and legs, he never changed, but on his countenance<lb facs="P49_TL00024"/>might still be seen the same calm supernatural glare, the same unwin«<lb facs="P49_TL00025"/>king eyes. AH seemed over with him, when suddenly in burst the<lb facs="P49_TL00026"/>44 terribil Gobbo " himself, In complete steel, and striking the floor with<lb facs="P49_TL00027"/>a succession of bold knocks, and waving with convulsive jerks his sword,<lb facs="P49_TL00028"/>brought help at the most opportune moment.

Siena was, In 1357, added to the<lb facs="P77_TL00015"/>dominions of Cosmo, Duke of Florence, who, after some time, obtained<lb facs="P77_TL00016"/>the title of Grand Duke of Tuscany, but there never was a Duke of Vienna.<lb facs="P77_TL00017"/>On these grounds 1 base the conclusion arrived at above. <lb facs="P77_TL00018"/>The scenes, which are wholly architectural, are arranged In a man<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P77_TL00019"/>ner that is, at first sight, almost irreconcileable with the modern stage<lb facs="P77_TL00020"/>requirements of set or built scenery. In the eighteen scenes, of which<lb facs="P77_TL00021"/>the five acts of the play are composed, we have thirteen different ones,<lb facs="P77_TL00022"/>Including one interior in the Duke's palace, two interiors in Angeio's<lb facs="P77_TL00023"/>house, a room in Mariana's house, one room in a monastery, two<lb facs="P77_TL00024"/>interiors of a prison, one of a nunnery, three street scenes, a suburban<lb facs="P77_TL00025"/>road; and a piazza or public open place near the city gate. The chief<lb facs="P77_TL00026"/>difficulties are in the introduction of the two conventual houses In<lb facs="P77_TL00027"/>the fourth and fifth Scenes of the first Act, in the insertion in the<lb facs="P77_TL00028"/>middle of the second Act of the prison, and in the arrangement of<lb facs="P77_TL00029"/>the whole of the fourth Act. Reverence for the author makes one<lb facs="P77_TL00030"/>hesitate to suggest omissions or changes in the division of the Act,<lb facs="P77_TL00031"/>which involve any considerable alteration. At the same time; by<lb facs="P77_TL00032"/>taking far less liberty with the text than has been, and is still taken<lb facs="P77_TL00033"/>by theatrical managers, we may find It quite possible to bring this<lb facs="P77_TL00034"/>play wlthtn the bounds of four set scenes.

The arrangement I propose would then stand as<lb facs="P78_TL00007"/>follows • •••<lb facs="P78_TL00008"/>Act 1. A street.<lb facs="P78_TL00009"/>Act 11; Interior of Angelo's house.<lb facs="P78_TL00010"/>Act 111. Interior of prison.<lb facs="P78_TL00011"/>Act IV. Outside the city gates.<lb facs="P78_TL00012"/>The scene for the first Act may be an open place before the Duke's<lb facs="P78_TL00013"/>palace, with streets leading out of it in opposite directions. A loggia<lb facs="P78_TL00014"/>or a lofty open structure, like the open external Renais&amp;nce chapel<lb facs="P78_TL00015"/>attached to the angle of the palace at Siena, would fully meet the<lb facs="P78_TL00016"/>requirements of the first Scenes in the play, where the Duke bids<lb facs="P78_TL00017"/>farewell to his deputies. On the other hand, seeing that the courts<lb facs="P78_TL00018"/>of Mediaeval palaces were used frequently as thoroughfares (like the<lb facs="P78_TL00019"/>cloisters of Westminster Abbey), we shall be quite consistent if we<lb facs="P78_TL00020"/>place the scene within the court, which measures about feet by<lb facs="P78_TL00021"/>30 feet, and is surrounded by a cloister about 13 feet wide. At one end<lb facs="P78_TL00022"/>is the staircase leading to the ducal apartments, and to the foot of<lb facs="P78_TL00023"/>this, under the archway opening into the quadrangle, the Duke;<lb facs="P78_TL00024"/>Escalus, lords, and attendants would descend at the rise of the curtain.<lb facs="P78_TL00025"/>I give a sketch-plan in Fig. 1 showing the actual position of the<lb facs="P78_TL00026"/>exits E, staircase S, and the pillars of the cloister surrounding the<lb facs="P78_TL00027"/>quadrangle or court C, M N is the proscenium. Where there is plenty<lb facs="P78_TL00028"/>of depth on the stage the court may be set square, the staircase being<lb facs="P78_TL00029"/>at the back, as in diagram, Fig. 11. The architecture of the palace<lb facs="P78_TL00030"/>is Gothic of the fourteenth century. The building is of three storeys,<lb facs="P78_TL00031"/>and is almost entirely constructed of red brick. The hooks and rings<lb facs="P78_TL00032"/>for the ropes and poles of the awnings or blinds to the main windows<lb facs="P78_TL00033"/>on the first-floor still remain, and the bare mention of such things is<lb facs="P78_TL00034"/>quite sufficient to suggest to any scenic-artist, deserving the name, the<lb facs="P78_TL00035"/>charming effect that such a scene as this might possess. <lb facs="P78_TL00036"/>Measured elevations and details of this palace, and of the almost<lb facs="P78_TL00037"/>equally interesting palace Buonsignori, are given by Messrs.

It is true that there is a short scene (3rd) of about<lb facs="P81_TL00018"/>iorty lines which takes us to the prison, and allows a night to pass<lb facs="P81_TL00019"/>before we find ourselves back in Angelo's room. But this scene may<lb facs="P81_TL00020"/>very well-be transferred to the third Act, and by a very slight omission<lb facs="P81_TL00021"/>in the text the unity of time and place may be preserved throughout<lb facs="P81_TL00022"/>the Act. The scene, then, we have to provide must be a hall arranged<lb facs="P81_TL00023"/>as a justice chamber in the palace of my Lord Angelo. Again I find<lb facs="P81_TL00024"/>myself constrained to adopt a diagonally planned scene, as shown in Fig#<lb facs="P81_TL00025"/>III* Here M. N. is the proscenium ; S, staircase for the use of Angelo ;<lb facs="P81_TL00026"/>C, a courtyard; E, exits; and D dais for the Deputies and Justices. The<lb facs="P81_TL00027"/>architecture may be either Gothic like the refined thirteenth century<lb facs="P81_TL00028"/>work of the Palazzo Buonsignori, from one of the rooms of which I<lb facs="P81_TL00029"/>have constructed this scene; or it may be Renaissance, like the Picco<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Razzi<lb facs="P81_TL00034"/>(erroneously printed Bazzi in my notes on the Merchant of Venice),<lb facs="P81_TL00035"/>who lived and painted in the first half of the sixteenth century, was<lb facs="P81_TL00036"/>to Siena very much what Tintoretto was to Venice, and his work<lb facs="P81_TL00037"/>may be seen in frescos and altar-pieces in palace, and church, and</ab>

In this I<lb facs="P82_TL00025"/>include besides the whole of the fifth Act of the play the short fifth<lb facs="P82_TL00026"/>and sixth Scenes of the fourth;, and thus the latter is divided between<lb facs="P82_TL00027"/>the third and last Acts. The fields outside the town, the street near<lb facs="P82_TL00028"/>the city gate, and the public place near the city gate, are three scenes<lb facs="P82_TL00029"/>which can easily [be thrown into one without doing the slightest<lb facs="P82_TL00030"/>violence to the course of the action.

The first Is of delicate material, and is the utmost development<lb facs="P83_TL00015"/>of the veil reaching almost to the idea of a cloak and hood. The second<lb facs="P83_TL00016"/>is a kind of overall, with shaped body and shoulders. The dress of the<lb facs="P83_TL00017"/>noble is open in front, revealing a richly ornamented skirt, the body<lb facs="P83_TL00018"/>cut low, aad sleeves tight from elbow to wrist. The noble lady wears a<lb facs="P83_TL00019"/>round-topped broad-brimmed hat, very like the modern felt worn by<lb facs="P83_TL00020"/>gentlemen in the country. A stiff-lace collar at the back of the neck, and<lb facs="P83_TL00021"/>a lace stomacher are to be seen in the second example. Both ladies have<lb facs="P83_TL00022"/>gloves, necklets of pearls, and neck chains, but no fans. For the rest of<lb facs="P83_TL00023"/>the costume we may refer to Vecelllo's drawings of the inhabitants of<lb facs="P83_TL00024"/>Florence and other towns in Southern Italy.

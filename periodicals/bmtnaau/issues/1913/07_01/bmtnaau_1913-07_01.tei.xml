The gospel has always been preached ac=<lb facs="P39_TL00009"/>cording to Nicodemo.<lb facs="P39_TL00010"/>The illustrious professor Fiorentino, with that gravity of style which<lb facs="P39_TL00011"/>makes him one of the ablest of critics* and not of Italy only, has also<lb facs="P39_TL00012"/>joined the contest, and suggested a doubt whether Porta ever wrote any<lb facs="P39_TL00013"/>plays at all. His reasoning is something like this : 44 You assert that Porta<lb facs="P39_TL00014"/>44 wrote them, for no other reason except that you have heard that a<lb facs="P39_TL00015"/>&lt;« scenario " called 44 La Notte " was the work of this author. Now you<lb facs="P39_TL00016"/>44 should know that that " celebrated " Notte Is not a 44 scenario " and<lb facs="P39_TL00017"/>44 in 1610 was ready for the press, and figures among the works of which<lb facs="P39_TL00018"/>44 the Manuscripts were consigned by De Filiis to the Publisher Bar<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

" JZ?<lb facs="P39_TL00020"/>&amp; The 44 scenari", according to Fiorentino, served for the 44 commedla<lb facs="P39_TL00021"/>dell'arte ", 44 which was so called because it was always performed by<lb facs="P39_TL00022"/>44 professional actors while the learned comedy could be performed even<lb facs="P39_TL00023"/>44 by dilettanti. Porta kept on the edge of the learned comedy, and if<lb facs="P39_TL00024"/>44 towards the end of his dramatic career he turned somewhat from the<lb facs="P39_TL00025"/>4<lb facs="P39_TL00026"/>44 classic models and introduces some innovations, he never goes so far<lb facs="P39_TL00027"/>44 as the commedia dell'arte nor the use of masks. Porta never gives any<lb facs="P39_TL00028"/>44 indications that his plays were performed save by dilettanti ; much<lb facs="P39_TL00029"/>44 less then would it enter his mind to sketch out 44 canevacci " which<lb facs="P39_TL00030"/>44 to such actors would be absolutely useless. The improvised comedy,<lb facs="P39_TL00031"/>44 or comedy 44 a soggetto " as we usually call it, served for one who<lb facs="P39_TL00032"/>44 was both author and actor, as was Moliere in later times.

It is<lb facs="P54_TL00006"/>quite natural to him, but it occurs to nobody to cry out that a terrible<lb facs="P54_TL00007"/>disaster has happened to the English nation when he does die. %<lb facs="P54_TL00008"/>Or there is another man attempting to restore beauty, to discover<lb facs="P54_TL00009"/>again something as lost and as unknown as the North or South ,<lb facs="P54_TL00010"/>...that is to say, beauty. He may be an architect or a musician, and he<lb facs="P54_TL00011"/>gives his life to it. Nobody notices that he has given it. No large head*<lb facs="P54_TL00012"/>lines of ♦* Tragic Fate of Richard Wagner ", " Terrible disaster to August<lb facs="P54_TL00013"/>Strindberg ".<lb facs="P54_TL00014"/>And a very good thing that there are no such headlines when these<lb facs="P54_TL00015"/>men die; but, and here we come to the point of this note, do not forget<lb facs="P54_TL00016"/>that the acts are parallel and of the same importance; do not forget<lb facs="P54_TL00017"/>that a small group in every branch of life in the world Is giving its life<lb facs="P54_TL00018"/>willingly to discover things for the rest of the world and that the<lb facs="P54_TL00019"/>rest of the world does nothing to assist them.<lb facs="P54_TL00020"/>The rest of the world merely weeps buckets of unnecessary and saltless<lb facs="P54_TL00021"/>tears on hearing of the death of some brave captain. <lb facs="P54_TL00022"/>jg? At the head of the group of men who give their lives in this work is<lb facs="P54_TL00023"/>the king. Of course the world imagines that he is at the head of the<lb facs="P54_TL00024"/>other spectators, and not of the workers. They look on him as a kind of<lb facs="P54_TL00025"/>patron of indolence, a most amusing but general idea, for most people<lb facs="P54_TL00026"/>are indolent and only begin to work when the tragic news arrives. Then<lb facs="P54_TL00027"/>they run to and fro, wailing and moaning, and feeling, or rather trying<lb facs="P54_TL00028"/>to feel, something,... who knows what? JZ? ■£? JZ?<lb facs="P54_TL00029"/>*<lb facs="P54_TL00030"/>Now if this small section of which I have spoken is the heroic group,<lb facs="P54_TL00031"/>fr<lb facs="P54_TL00032"/>how is it that the heroic group has such difficulty in advancing and<lb facs="P54_TL00033"/>changing things, so as to make them more human,... I do not say more<lb facs="P54_TL00034"/>comfortable, but more human, more natural? It is that the members of<lb facs="P54_TL00035"/>this heroic group have the whole world of womankind against them.<lb facs="P54_TL00036"/>yg? This is not said because I do not understand women, (though Heaven<lb facs="P54_TL00037"/>forbid that I should pretend to understand them thoroughly,) but it Is<lb facs="P54_TL00038"/>said because this must be the only explanation of the extraordinary way<lb facs="P54_TL00039"/>in which the world is carrying on today.</ab>

JZ?<lb facs="P64_TL00019"/>0<lb facs="P64_TL00020"/>And travelling he met a magician from whom he learned all kinds of<lb facs="P64_TL00021"/>tricks. He could become invisible, could fly up into the sky, could jump<lb facs="P64_TL00022"/>a hundred miles In a single jump ; and so he soon grew to believe himself<lb facs="P64_TL00023"/>better and stronger than anything else. Then he determined to make<lb facs="P64_TL00024"/>himself Lord of the Sky ..." Have you heard of the new King of the<lb facs="P64_TL00025"/>Monkeys?" the Lord Buddha was asked... "No", replied the God.<lb facs="P64_TL00026"/>" What is there to hear about him ? " ... "He means to turn out the<lb facs="P64_TL00027"/>Lord of the Sky, believing that he is a Great Being"...<lb facs="P64_TL00028"/>JZ? So the Buddha went up into the clouds in search of the little Stone<lb facs="P64_TL00029"/>Monkey, and found him misbehaving himself, insulting everybody who<lb facs="P64_TL00030"/>dared to interfere with him.

For this reason we have<lb facs="P73_TL00007"/>shown the system of the abbreviated (zigzag) lines, which In certain<lb facs="P73_TL00008"/>points are joined together, and consist of small straight parts. <lb facs="P73_TL00009"/>In the second place the nerves and flesh in the human body curve.<lb facs="P73_TL00010"/>Hence, when the body bends to the sides, or forwards, or backwards, the<lb facs="P73_TL00011"/>nerves and flesh make curves, so that in one part a hollow appears, in<lb facs="P73_TL00012"/>another a convexity. &amp; &amp; &amp; ■&amp;<lb facs="P73_TL00013"/>&amp; In the third place we spoke of .the lines being when either<lb facs="P73_TL00014"/>the body itself moves, or the arms or feet, or the flank and the greater<lb facs="P73_TL00015"/>part of the other members which are in the body.<lb facs="P73_TL00016"/>&amp; in the fourth place we spoke of intricato or intorchiatot which inter<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Likewise in the curves and bendlngs the<lb facs="P73_TL00029"/>flesh moves, and almost of Itself presses outwards or inwards or to one<lb facs="P73_TL00030"/>side. &lt;j&amp;je?<lb facs="P73_TL00031"/>Now all of these six differences can come about in the movement of<lb facs="P73_TL00032"/>the body in such away that one may say that the members either bend<lb facs="P73_TL00033"/>or turn or separate ; and thus the flesh and the other soft parts make<lb facs="P73_TL00034"/>curves, Interlace, or contort, and so we naturally see the various parts<lb facs="P73_TL00035"/>pressing one upon another. &amp;<lb facs="P73_TL00036"/>Thus, from these principles which have been here demonstrated,<lb facs="P73_TL00037"/>everyone can make their own designs in such an attitude as they may</ab>

But to achieve this, experiment is necessary...<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>experiment, the thorough nature of which is impossible in the actual<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>conduct of a Theatre and only possible in such a foundation as is now<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>proposed. £? &amp;<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>Certain picked men will conduct researches Into every aspect of the<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>three elements Sound, Light and Movement of which the Art of<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>the Theatre is composed. They will publicly and privately produce plays,<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>and they will constantly be in touch with certain Theatres, which, by<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>a system of cooperation, will have the benefit of all that is discovered<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>and created in the School in return for their support.<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>£/ It is hoped that the School, while being a practical and working<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>Institution, will exercise a living influence on the Art of the present,<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>and create in course of time a solid basis upon which the workers of<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>the future will be able to build a vital and supreme Art. The whole of<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>the continent is now interested in the work of this Englishman, Gordon<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>Craig. Only England is holding back, not because she does not want,<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>but because she does not know. If this School can become a practical<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>reality the eyes of all that Europe which is interested in the theatre,<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>will turn with eager expectancy in our direction; and Paris, Berlin,<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>Moscow, Florence, Munich, Budapest and the other great cities of the<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>continent will experience the novelty of deriving their lessons in Art<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>from an English institution, conducted and inspired by an Englishman,<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>on whom every one of them is already casting covetous glances, and<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>from whom some of them have already derived lasting benefits. <lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>Hear what Dr. Alexander Hevesi, Dramaturg=Regisseur of the State<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>Theatre, Budapest, has to say about him: "He (Mr. Craig) has his<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>admirers and followers in our little Hungary, the whole of the new ge<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

And we had to dance round a forest of trees and<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>blow on huge kind of trumpets. It was a silly play... and we hardly made<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>any money. Yet now Mr Carter has written a book on the modern Theatre,<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>and I have been so successful that ! am able to spend all my time in<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>Paris and Peru where I am studying a Drama which... but no one is<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>interested in what I am doing.^<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>And nobody in England was interested enough to help Mr Carter in<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>his making of this book.

He was present, like myself, at all the rehearsals, and<lb facs="P19_TL00029"/>after each successful performance of one of his plays he was in the- habit<lb facs="P19_TL00030"/>of inviting the actors to spend a day with him in pleasure.

And more than<lb facs="P27_TL00024"/>that, it has become a true and lnportant dramatis persona, revealing to<lb facs="P27_TL00025"/>the theatre and to the dramatic poet unexpected and inexhaustible vistas<lb facs="P27_TL00026"/>and possibilities.<lb facs="P27_TL00027"/>&amp; This conquest, which, like everything which Gordon Craig creates, is<lb facs="P27_TL00028"/>the outcome of experiments and proved by being put into practise, is so<lb facs="P27_TL00029"/>9<lb facs="P27_TL00030"/>fertile in its consequences and so wonderful and important, that of Itself<lb facs="P27_TL00031"/>alone it suffices to give us full confidence in him both as true reformer<lb facs="P27_TL00032"/>and as the only supreme judge of our day in the realm of Theatrical Art.<lb facs="P27_TL00033"/>£/ Yet even this is not all. £?

I can imagine wonder and beauty<lb facs="P32_TL00021"/>in this theatre of Mr Craig's ideal; I hope I may live to see it. And<lb facs="P32_TL00022"/>though in this matter I do not agree with Mr Craig, still his criticism<lb facs="P32_TL00023"/>of the dramatic poet.... I use the term In its large and liberal sense,....<lb facs="P32_TL00024"/>is in the main a true one. £?<lb facs="P32_TL00025"/>The drama is too much a written thing. Certainly our poets who have<lb facs="P32_TL00026"/>attempted drama since Elizabethan times have been far too much writers<lb facs="P32_TL00027"/>and far too little makers of plays. They have built in the air conceiving<lb facs="P32_TL00028"/>their work as little more than a succession of speeches and even the<lb facs="P32_TL00029"/>speeches have too much the character of writing, too little that of speech.<lb facs="P32_TL00030"/>I am far from thinking with Mr Craig that Shakespeare's tragedies<lb facs="P32_TL00031"/>do not gain on the stage, much as they may also lose. But probably in<lb facs="P32_TL00032"/>all plays there is a tendency to rely too much on the word. A dramatist's<lb facs="P32_TL00033"/>material is not only language; it is even more the action, gesture, movement<lb facs="P32_TL00034"/>which the stage alone gives him; not to speak of the emotional equiva<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The country of<lb facs="P44_TL00008"/>Pierrot, the real Pierrot, Punambules or no Punambules, Is not a real<lb facs="P44_TL00009"/>country. The actual scenery in the theatre is too full of illusion.

All<lb facs="P44_TL00011"/>the scenery is so bourgeois that the Theatre de I'Odeon might not some<lb facs="P44_TL00012"/>day be sorry to buy it all up. Why, there are little yellow rooms which<lb facs="P44_TL00013"/>would do well for the works of M.

You may be true to yourself there, but not to<lb facs="P44_TL00019"/>nature. You will be true to your deception, for you are deceived about<lb facs="P44_TL00020"/>pantomime in general, as well as Pierrot.

The latter finds<lb facs="P53_TL00021"/>out the magic word that summons the spirits and to his amazement is<lb facs="P53_TL00022"/>surrounded by them.

The rough structure of the stage was half in [light, half in deep<lb facs="P54_TL00026"/>shadow.

                                    <lb facs="P82_TL00004"/>Qnce walking with my little boy in Genoa on a warm summer night I<lb facs="P82_TL00005"/>was attracted towards a dark archway by the sounds of rhythmical<lb facs="P82_TL00006"/>noises. Under the arch we witnessed a jolly sight.<lb facs="P82_TL00007"/>A ring of dark niggers, their biack arms and heads glistening in the<lb facs="P82_TL00008"/>4<lb facs="P82_TL00009"/>sparkles of light which came from a bad lamp; all of them clapping<lb facs="P82_TL00010"/>rhythmically with their huge hands. ...Such an easy charming sound, and<lb facs="P82_TL00011"/>one of them in the centre of the ring dancing like only a biack man<lb facs="P82_TL00012"/>can dance,... dancing like the very dickens. J£?<lb facs="P82_TL00013"/>&amp; We both of us drew nearer and watched.<lb facs="P82_TL00014"/>&amp; The dancer leaps and glides,... and glides again and falls; boils up<lb facs="P82_TL00015"/>again and bounds round the ring; then simmers; finally falls only to<lb facs="P82_TL00016"/>rise instantaneously; then tumbles into his place in the ring and starts<lb facs="P82_TL00017"/>his rhythmic hand music. Almost before he has left the centre a second<lb facs="P82_TL00018"/>has filled his place,... a poorer dancer, but good for all that. <lb facs="P82_TL00019"/>The excitement is not so great, so the first dancer returns to the<lb facs="P82_TL00020"/>charge, capering round his fellow in the centre, aiding and abbetting<lb facs="P82_TL00021"/>him. ...What a noise, what an experience, what inspiration ! <lb facs="P82_TL00022"/>The feet of these dancers pound and shuffle for me to far subtler<lb facs="P82_TL00023"/>rhythms than ever any other dancers have yet done,.... and I have seen<lb facs="P82_TL00024"/>and listened to many.<lb facs="P82_TL00025"/>£&gt; Their stage was the most profound 1 have ever seen, their choice of<lb facs="P82_TL00026"/>place and time subtler than that of even the greatest of Russian or Greek<lb facs="P82_TL00027"/>dancers. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P82_TL00028"/>&amp; Oh, how they laughed, and how we laughed, and how wild the dance<lb facs="P82_TL00029"/>grew.

JS? *£?<lb facs="P82_TL00034"/>&amp; And Mr Sharp's dances and dancers ? We both saw them, and we<lb facs="P82_TL00035"/>both liked some of them.

A sane<lb facs="P83_TL00014"/>dancer is a like a sane donkey ride; a ridiculous affair. To assemble in<lb facs="P83_TL00015"/>evening dress and white kid gloves and go on like the Rabbit in "Alice<lb facs="P83_TL00016"/>In Wonderland" is sane. That's what men do at most dances.

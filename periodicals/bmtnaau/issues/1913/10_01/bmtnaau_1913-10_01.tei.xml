Bapst in his essay " Sur J'Histoire du Theatre " shows us a fine<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>engraving of this theatre printed in the year 1493, which reveals quite<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>a number of interesting facts. The engraving is taken from the ''Terence"<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>of Trechsel, and this is what M. Bapst has to say about it:<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>" The custom of reserving a place for the Municipality was general<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>at the period of the Mystery Plays, that is to say, at the end of the<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth century.<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>&amp; ** We find the proof of this in the frontispiece of the " Terence " of<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>Trechsel, representing a theatre. The stage is there, as in our days,<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>flanked by boxes between columns, and above the box which we should<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>today call the " avant=sc6ne " is to be read the Inscription " Edlles ":<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>To the side are the stages or galleries for the rich spectators; they are<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>continued all round the circumference of the theatre; below is the<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>general public.<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>" The custom of placing near the stage, at the side of the auditorium,<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>the box for the sovereign or for the authorities presiding at the pertor-</ab>

In the interior of France the custom must have<lb facs="P14_TL00005"/>been different; we shall see later on that the personage who presided<lb facs="P14_TL00006"/>at the performance of the Mysteries in these parts was installed in the<lb facs="P14_TL00007"/>middle of the amphitheatre, that is to say, in the position in which the<lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>royal box is today placed in the Italian theatres. JZ&gt; JZ/ &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00009"/>" The "Terence" engraving also shows that in 1493 the most important<lb facs="P14_TL00010"/>Mysteries were performed in a real theatre with a real auditorium, con=<lb facs="P14_TL00011"/>structed in timber for the occasion. " &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>M. Bapst then quotes a note in this same engraving by M. Edmond<lb facs="P14_TL00013"/>Le Blanc, a member of the Institute, who states that " On the ground<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>floor of the theatre represented in the " Terence" engraving &lt;of 1493 is<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>seen a series of chambers above which Is Inscribed the word "Fornices".<lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>These chambers were nothing else than the- haunts of the courtesans,<lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>who gave themselves up, in the neighbourhood of the ancient theatres,<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>to prostitution. The couples represented in the engraving with which<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>we are occupied do not, moreover, leave in their attitude any doubt as<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>to the nature of the converse which they are carrying on. " JZ? J&amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>JZ? And now let us have a look at the print. It may even tell us more<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>than M. Bapst tells u5,... I mean that perhaps it will bear looking into<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>a little more thoroughly. *zt jZ? jzs jZ? &amp;<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>Let us for the moment consider the shape of the "front of the house",<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>as it is called, the auditorium, and after that let us go on to the stage.<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>■£? The Auditorium. This curious and very interesting woodcut from<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>the " Terence " shows us the outside of the Theatre and the inside. To<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>judge from the picture we are to believe it was a vast building of two<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>storeys, the first storey being at least 30 feet high, and the second storey<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>about 35 to 40 feet. That would make the whole building 70 feet. £?<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>Now this is an enormous building, and although we need not entirely<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>give up hope that in the 15th century they took the trouble to erect<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>large sized houses for the drama, still, we need not exaggerate the size<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>into 70 feet. JZ? JZ? <lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>looking at the woodcut again, I think we shall have to arrive at<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>this conclusion:... that the building had outside walls of about 30 feet<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>high, and that it had some kind of dome which raised it another 10 feet.</ab>

" &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00011"/>It may be helpful for us, then, to enquire about the doings of the<lb facs="P22_TL00012"/>Indian puppet in his own home, in past and present times.<lb facs="P22_TL00013"/>4'ln ancient India", says Professor Pischel, (i) "puppets were made out<lb facs="P22_TL00014"/>of wool, wood, buffalo°&gt;horn, and Ivory, and these playthings were quite<lb facs="P22_TL00015"/>as popular long ago with the girls of that country as they are with our<lb facs="P22_TL00016"/>girls at the present day... Puppets might even become dangerous rivals<lb facs="P22_TL00017"/>to deities. A legend runs that Parvatl, wife of the god Siva, made herself<lb facs="P22_TL00018"/>such a beautiful doll, that she thought It necessary to conceal it from the<lb facs="P22_TL00019"/>eyes of her husband. She carried it far away to the Malaya mountain, but<lb facs="P22_TL00020"/>visited it every day, that she might adorn it. Siva, rendered suspicious by<lb facs="P22_TL00021"/>her long absence, stole after her, saw the doll, fell In love with it, and<lb facs="P22_TL00022"/>gave it life. There is also an early mention of puppets worked by machinery.<lb facs="P22_TL00023"/>We read in the Kathasaritsagara, the great collection of tales by the<lb facs="P22_TL00024"/>Kashmiri Somadeva, that Somaprabha, the daughter of the Asura Maya,<lb facs="P22_TL00025"/>a celebrated mechanician, brought as a present to her friend Princess<lb facs="P22_TL00026"/>Kalingasena a basket of mechanical wooden puppets, constructed by her<lb facs="P22_TL00027"/>father. There was a wooden peg in each of the puppets, and when this<lb facs="P22_TL00028"/>was touched, one of them flew through the air. fetched a wreath, and<lb facs="P22_TL00029"/>returned when ordered; another, when desired, brought water in the same<lb facs="P22_TL00030"/>way ; a third danced, and a fourth carried on conversation. This delighted<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>Kalingasena so much that she neglected her meals in order to play with<lb facs="P22_TL00032"/>them ... Talking puppets were also introduced on the stage. In this case<lb facs="P22_TL00033"/>they were not, as a rule, worked by internal mechanism, but by means<lb facs="P22_TL00034"/>of a thread (sntra), manipulated by the puppet player... An allusion to<lb facs="P22_TL00035"/>such puppets, moved by threads, is found as far back as the Mahabharata.<lb facs="P22_TL00036"/>In this work men are compared to puppets, inasmuch as they have no will</ab>

It is the only passage in the whole<lb facs="P23_TL00013"/>of Indian literature where puppets appear on the stage In a Sanskrit<lb facs="P23_TL00014"/>drama, and what is still more important, we learn from it the name for<lb facs="P23_TL00015"/>puppet=pla&gt;er in the tenth century. He is called sutradhara, " thread<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P23_TL00016"/>holder ", which corresponds to the epithet " attached to<lb facs="P23_TL00017"/>threads ", applied to puppets in the Mahabharata. And sutradhar is still<lb facs="P23_TL00018"/>the name for a puppet-player in India at the present day... j£f<lb facs="P23_TL00019"/>" The stage manager (in fully developed Indian drama) is called, as<lb facs="P23_TL00020"/>in the puppet-play, sutradhara, " thread-holder ". From this fact, as early<lb facs="P23_TL00021"/>as 1879, a native scholar of European education, Shankar Pandurang<lb facs="P23_TL00022"/>Pandit by name, drew the reasonable conclusion that performances by<lb facs="P23_TL00023"/>puppets and paper figures must have preceded those by human beings<lb facs="P23_TL00024"/>There was also a second manager, called sthapaka, the setter up.<lb facs="P23_TL00025"/>Except in this connection, this word is applied only to the priest who<lb facs="P23_TL00026"/>had to set up the images of the gods, when they were solemnly conse<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Yet they cannot well see how two<lb facs="P77_TL00023"/>or three authors could sit year after year together, and affably compose<lb facs="P77_TL00024"/>these turbulent, rollicking wonders.<lb facs="P77_TL00025"/>I hazard a guess which Is as much a guess as all the " evidence "<lb facs="P77_TL00026"/>brought together in large volumes about Shakespeare. I believe that<lb facs="P77_TL00027"/>there is a mystery about the authorship of the plays, but not a very<lb facs="P77_TL00028"/>deep one; and that for this reason it has eluded those sappers who have<lb facs="P77_TL00029"/>passed it while delving. 1 consider the mystery to be a subtle one, but<lb facs="P77_TL00030"/>not half so subtle as the Donellys and others would have us suppose.<lb facs="P77_TL00031"/>&amp; In my opinion the Dramas were created by Shakespeare in close<lb facs="P77_TL00032"/>collaboration with the Manager of the Theatre and with the actors ; in<lb facs="P77_TL00033"/>fact, with practically the whole of the company who invented, produced,<lb facs="P77_TL00034"/>and acted them ; and I believe that a glimpse at the manuscript of the<lb facs="P77_TL00035"/>Plays would reveal a mass of corrections, additions , and cuts made in</ab>

We should be less astounded at<lb facs="P79_TL00011"/>Shakespeare's accomplishment were his Dramas less complete... if they<lb facs="P79_TL00012"/>lacked their grossness... their popular appeal... their naturalness, which,<lb facs="P79_TL00013"/>added to the sublimity of their poetic imagery, makes them seem too<lb facs="P79_TL00014"/>complete for one man to have created, alone.<lb facs="P79_TL00015"/>&amp; The naturalness of the Dramas was, 1 believe, wafted to England from<lb facs="P79_TL00016"/>Italy.

                                    <lb facs="P79_TL00018"/>pealed Instantly, like the repartee of the peasants. There was something<lb facs="P79_TL00019"/>so apt, so right about the touch of this new Drama that its fitness was<lb facs="P79_TL00020"/>not decreased by the fact that hundreds of actors could give it birth. It<lb facs="P79_TL00021"/>was not a literary effort... quite the reverse. It was good talk... wonderful<lb facs="P79_TL00022"/>patter.

The Manager having planned<lb facs="P79_TL00029"/>out the story... which he pieced together from old tales... puts the<lb facs="P79_TL00030"/>material into the hands of Shakespeare, with this direction... that he is<lb facs="P79_TL00031"/>to " go easy " with the characters of Benedick, Beatrice, Dogberry and<lb facs="P79_TL00032"/>Verges, for these four roles are to be played by the four first comedians,<lb facs="P79_TL00033"/>and these men know something about acting! &lt;£? £? j£&gt;<lb facs="P79_TL00034"/>&amp; Shakespeare then sets to work.

"What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?"<lb facs="P80_TL00020"/>I have the greatest pride in replying on behalf of the actors of the<lb facs="P80_TL00021"/>sixteenth century... Yes, they were equal to inventing that passage and<lb facs="P80_TL00022"/>very many others, such as the Benedick and Beatrice scenes, Act 2,<lb facs="P80_TL00023"/>Scene 1., and Act 4, Scene 1; besides the Dogberry scenes in Acts 3, 4<lb facs="P80_TL00024"/>and 5. All these, 1 consider, must in great part be attributed to the actors,<lb facs="P80_TL00025"/>jg? Indeed, much of the Elizabethan Comedy is the work of the actors,<lb facs="P80_TL00026"/>produced in that spontaneous manner; many of those brilliant flashes<lb facs="P80_TL00027"/>of genius which have helped to give Shakespeare the position he holds<lb facs="P80_TL00028"/>today were first struck out in the sharp encounter of wits on the boards<lb facs="P80_TL00029"/>of the stage. But although we may quite easily believe this... as everyone<lb facs="P80_TL00030"/>who has studied the history of the Commedia dell'Arte will believe it...<lb facs="P80_TL00031"/>we may also be sure that the repartee was not exactly the same on the<lb facs="P80_TL00032"/>first performance as on the fiftieth. In fact, we may be positive that it<lb facs="P80_TL00033"/>varied much at every performance ; but during those fifty representations<lb facs="P80_TL00034"/>the best part of the actors' improvisations were recorded by some scribe...<lb facs="P80_TL00035"/>perhaps even by Shakespeare... and written into the manuscript. <lb facs="P80_TL00036"/>«&lt;£&gt; Later on, Shakespeare, knowing that the Plays were to be published,<lb facs="P80_TL00037"/>took the whole play and polished it; and if he removed some of its</ab>

In the<lb facs="P81_TL00019"/>second of these two scenes the poet has gathered together the gist of<lb facs="P81_TL00020"/>the speeches of the actors, and has given it to us again in a far more<lb facs="P81_TL00021"/>lovely form than It could ever have possessed originally. But if you<lb facs="P81_TL00022"/>remove many of these lovely passages of Beatrice you do not alter the<lb facs="P81_TL00023"/>shape of the play, in fact, you improve it somewhat if you condense It<lb facs="P81_TL00024"/>into the true Drama.

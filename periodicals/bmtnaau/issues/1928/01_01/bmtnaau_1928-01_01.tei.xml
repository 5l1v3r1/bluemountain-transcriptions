" Haven't you got anything<lb facs="P11_TL00070"/>you want to reserve for yourself ?" asked<lb facs="P11_TL00071"/>his mother-in-law, and Ibsen replied: "Yes,<lb facs="P11_TL00072"/>Magnus Heineson ".

It was<lb facs="P11_TL00089"/>written in Dresden during the war of 1864<lb facs="P11_TL00090"/>and gave expression to Ibsen's feeling of<lb facs="P11_TL00091"/>shame and powerlessness at being compelled<lb facs="P11_TL00092"/>to sit still without being able to do anything.<lb facs="P11_TL00093"/>My next meeting with Ibsen was at the<lb facs="P11_TL00094"/>fete at the Dagmar Theatre, Copenhagen in<lb facs="P11_TL00095"/>honour of his seventieth birthday.

When he at 3 a. m. had to drive<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>to Hotel d'Angleterre (the supper was in a<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>room at the Dagmar Theatre) he demanded<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>that the two ladies should go with him in<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>the carriage, " The two husbands can do<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>without them so long, I suppose " he laughed.<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>I wish I could remember everything he<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>said about his writings and his methods!

I reassembled the<lb facs="P19_TL00009"/>crumpled pages and patched together the<lb facs="P19_TL00010"/>torn—it took me some time—and found that<lb facs="P19_TL00011"/>I had the first two volumes, nothing at all<lb facs="P19_TL00012"/>missing, although I feared, like the trembling<lb facs="P19_TL00013"/>collator of incunabula, that every moment<lb facs="P19_TL00014"/>would bring me to a fatal hiatus. For I had<lb facs="P19_TL00015"/>not failed to notice that there were theatrical<lb facs="P19_TL00016"/>paragraphs and a few portraits of musicians<lb facs="P19_TL00017"/>and actresses.<lb facs="P19_TL00018"/>There could not have been a great many<lb facs="P19_TL00019"/>of these weeklies published.

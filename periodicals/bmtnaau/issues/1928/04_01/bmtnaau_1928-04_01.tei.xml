Today there are less than 500 houses<lb facs="P20_TL00080"/>which ploy legitimate shows. This included<lb facs="P20_TL00081"/>the houses playing pictures five days Weekly<lb facs="P20_TL00082"/>and a show for one night.

You are told ordinary things that<lb facs="P20_TL00091"/>you'd like to know in a plain way: "that<lb facs="P20_TL00092"/>the gross intake at all motion picture houses<lb facs="P20_TL00093"/>is about 60 times greater than all legitimate<lb facs="P20_TL00094"/>houses combined ; and when wishing to<lb facs="P20_TL00095"/>discover what is the gross intake (what it was<lb facs="P20_TL00096"/>in 1925 for example), you turn to page 5<lb facs="P20_TL00097"/>and you can learn that it amounted to<lb facs="P20_TL00098"/>£130,000,000; in words, a hundred and<lb facs="P20_TL00099"/>thirty million pounds. to know<lb facs="P20_TL00100"/>how this money is spent you can discover -<lb facs="P20_TL00101"/>that on the same page.

                                    <lb facs="P38_TL00033"/>1 cannot, however, but deplore the enormous changes that<lb facs="P38_TL00034"/>have lately been taking place with regard to owners<lb facs="P38_TL00035"/>of theatres and impresarios. In the past a theatre company<lb facs="P38_TL00036"/>was one big happy family, in which the director was not<lb facs="P38_TL00037"/>only business manager, chief executive and legislative official,<lb facs="P38_TL00038"/>hut the owner of the theatre, and often the author of the<lb facs="P38_TL00039"/>plays. At the head of the five leading theatres we had some<lb facs="P38_TL00040"/>of the most remarkable men of the day—men who devoted<lb facs="P38_TL00041"/>all their lives, talent and activities to the pursuit of their<lb facs="P38_TL00042"/>art. To-day the director of a company is often a very<lb facs="P38_TL00043"/>able business man who looks upon the whole concern as<lb facs="P38_TL00044"/>a potentially profitable business, and there is consequently<lb facs="P38_TL00045"/>little of thai close friendly relationship that used to prevail.<lb facs="P38_TL00046"/>Therefor, in my opinion, all lovers of the stage should<lb facs="P38_TL00047"/>endeavour to restore some of the happy conditions that<lb facs="P38_TL00048"/>used to prevail in the theatre fifty years ago. Fifty years<lb facs="P38_TL00049"/>ago a manager of a company came in time to know every<lb facs="P38_TL00050"/>single member of the cast as well as if they belonged to<lb facs="P38_TL00051"/>the same family. There was an esprit de corps and a<lb facs="P38_TL00052"/>close relationship between promoter, actors and actresses<lb facs="P38_TL00053"/>that is usually absent to-day. For months all these people<lb facs="P38_TL00054"/>were thrown together in a manner that is almost impossible<lb facs="P38_TL00055"/>nowadays. They toured the country together, lived the<lb facs="P38_TL00056"/>same life, shared the same pleasures, successes and set<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P38_TL00057"/>backs, while jealousy was practically nonexistent. To-day<lb facs="P38_TL00058"/>there is much less of this personal contact, and the pro<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

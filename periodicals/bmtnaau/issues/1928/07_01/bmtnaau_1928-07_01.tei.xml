I met<lb facs="P10_TL00099"/>one of the workmen the day after his death, and told<lb facs="P10_TL00100"/>him of his old comrade's departure. " What, little<lb facs="P10_TL00101"/>Bill gone !" he said.

If a knife grinder, or other<lb facs="P10_TL00107"/>travelling oddity entered the court, Bill buttoned up his<lb facs="P10_TL00108"/>coat, cocked his hat, and bawled in imitation until the<lb facs="P10_TL00109"/>tears ran down the men's faces with laughter.

He was often haunted<lb facs="P16_TL00078"/>by an idea that there was some delusion in his sue-,<lb facs="P16_TL00079"/>cess, and that his fall would be as sudden and marked<lb facs="P16_TL00080"/>as his rise. He was very nervous, and his sufferings<lb facs="P16_TL00081"/>on a ' first night ' were painful to behold. He took<lb facs="P16_TL00082"/>too little rest, and was too much the slave of nervous<lb facs="P16_TL00083"/>excitement.

This was the last new part which he ever re-,<lb facs="P16_TL00092"/>presented, and soon after this period his performances<lb facs="P16_TL00093"/>became so fitful and uncertain, that practically he had<lb facs="P16_TL00094"/>retired from the London stage. He leaves a widow<lb facs="P16_TL00095"/>and family, and a son who is following his father's<lb facs="P16_TL00096"/>profession ".<lb facs="P16_TL00097"/>The son, I believe, is at Dublin, in the old theatre,<lb facs="P16_TL00098"/>where his father was once the popular favourite.<lb facs="P16_TL00099"/>Another writer has made public a few interesting<lb facs="P16_TL00100"/>reminiscences, which will not be deemed out of place<lb facs="P16_TL00101"/>here : —<lb facs="P16_TL00102"/>45 Sixteen years ago", he says, " I went to the<lb facs="P16_TL00103"/>Grecian Theatre (then known as the Grecian Saloon, and<lb facs="P16_TL00104"/>just emancipated from the influence of the ' Eagle ' and<lb facs="P16_TL00105"/>Bravo Rouse ), and saw a little man play Jacob Ear--<lb facs="P16_TL00106"/>wig in Boots at the Swan, in the most astoundingly</ab>

And then he became one of the most<lb facs="P37_TL00062"/>successful actors who ever appeared on<lb facs="P37_TL00063"/>the stage? — Yes; he was seen by the<lb facs="P37_TL00064"/>late Mr Farren, who engaged him for the<lb facs="P37_TL00065"/>Olympic.<lb facs="P37_TL00066"/>2989. Probably if Mr barren had taken the<lb facs="P37_TL00067"/>trouble to go to the Grecian he would<lb facs="P37_TL00068"/>have taken him from there? — I cannot<lb facs="P37_TL00069"/>speak upon probabilities.<lb facs="P37_TL00070"/>2990. We can, at all events, in a great<lb facs="P37_TL00071"/>measure attribute the enjoyment which we<lb facs="P37_TL00072"/>have obtained from the acting of Mr Robson<lb facs="P37_TL00073"/>to his having been an actor at the Grecian?<lb facs="P37_TL00074"/>— All actors have commenced in a humble<lb facs="P37_TL00075"/>way.

But who is to do this, and where<lb facs="P47_TL00039"/>is the money to come from?

Sir Gerald enlarged upon the fact<lb facs="P47_TL00050"/>that in England, and in England alone of all<lb facs="P47_TL00051"/>the countries which have claims to count,<lb facs="P47_TL00052"/>artistically speaking, Craig is recognised at<lb facs="P47_TL00053"/>far less than his true value. In Moscow, in<lb facs="P47_TL00054"/>Florence (and, indeed, all over Italy), and<lb facs="P47_TL00055"/>in Germany, his name is a household word.<lb facs="P47_TL00056"/>" It was forty years ago when I first saw<lb facs="P47_TL00057"/>him ", said Sir Gerald.

In the plate of 44 Franca Trippa—Fritellino *\ He<lb facs="P18_TL00068"/>is embracing a girl and is seen just bahind the left leg of<lb facs="P18_TL00069"/>Fritellino.

The<lb facs="P24_TL00017"/>best and certainly the most entertaining book<lb facs="P24_TL00018"/>about him appeared in Germany in 1920,<lb facs="P24_TL00019"/>entitled " Reinhardt und seine Buhne " by<lb facs="P24_TL00020"/>Ernst Stern and Heinz Herald. Published<lb facs="P24_TL00021"/>by Dr. Eysler and Co, Berlin, it soon ran<lb facs="P24_TL00022"/>into twenty thousand copies and has by now<lb facs="P24_TL00023"/>passed that figure.<lb facs="P24_TL00024"/>This is mainly because of Reinhardt's<lb facs="P24_TL00025"/>popularity in his native land. But its success<lb facs="P24_TL00026"/>was largely due to Ernst Stern the designer,<lb facs="P24_TL00027"/>who crammed the book (not a large one)<lb facs="P24_TL00028"/>with little sketches, big drawings, end pieces<lb facs="P24_TL00029"/>and what not on every page.

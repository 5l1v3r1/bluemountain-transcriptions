The one attacked<lb facs="P31_TL00061"/>the wicked actors, the other went for the<lb facs="P31_TL00062"/>wicked playwrights.<lb facs="P31_TL00063"/>They were alike in one particular.<lb facs="P31_TL00064"/>Both loved the Censor.<lb facs="P31_TL00065"/>It seems to us a strange thing to be able<lb facs="P31_TL00066"/>to say that Shaw could tolerate the Censor,<lb facs="P31_TL00067"/>but it is clear that, had he lived in the age<lb facs="P31_TL00068"/>of Congreve and Wycherley, he himself would<lb facs="P31_TL00069"/>have become the Censor.<lb facs="P31_TL00070"/>Living and writing his plays in our day,<lb facs="P31_TL00071"/>however, he fell foul of the Censor. The<lb facs="P31_TL00072"/>Censor was a man of the world and Shaw<lb facs="P31_TL00073"/>a reformer of it. Naturally reformers have<lb facs="P31_TL00074"/>to be censored more carefully than any other<lb facs="P31_TL00075"/>more ordinary men. In correcting the vices<lb facs="P31_TL00076"/>of the age, the reformers are apt to forget<lb facs="P31_TL00077"/>the first thing in any programme of reform—<lb facs="P31_TL00078"/>themselves. There Mr. Comstock and Mr.<lb facs="P31_TL00079"/>Shaw were altruists: in all else egoists.<lb facs="P31_TL00080"/>Like Falstaff they would banish all the<lb facs="P31_TL00081"/>world but not plump Jack.<lb facs="P31_TL00082"/>It seems to us a strange thing to be able<lb facs="P31_TL00083"/>to picture Comstock and Shaw as a couple<lb facs="P31_TL00084"/>of fat knights; but I take it Comstock is like<lb facs="P31_TL00085"/>the old Fellow gone thin, and Shaw, as can<lb facs="P31_TL00086"/>be seen any day from that immortal drawing<lb facs="P31_TL00087"/>of him made by Mr. Lowe, (!) is, round<lb facs="P31_TL00088"/>the eyes, the mouth, and nose, all Falstaff.<lb facs="P31_TL00089"/>But Falstaff with a purpose. lago posing as<lb facs="P31_TL00090"/>Falstaff.<lb facs="P31_TL00091"/>Not that Shaw would " stab men in the<lb facs="P31_TL00092"/>dark": he would be more likely to drop a<lb facs="P31_TL00093"/>purse of ducats in their pocket and then shout<lb facs="P31_TL00094"/>for the B3 Branch of the Society for carrying<lb facs="P31_TL00095"/>drunken men to Hospital, tip them well, and<lb facs="P31_TL00096"/>go home and write an article attacking that<lb facs="P31_TL00097"/>Society as incompetent and venial.<lb facs="P31_TL00098"/>What I mean is that Shaw puts on the<lb facs="P31_TL00099"/>Falstaffian way to hide the awful direness of<lb facs="P31_TL00100"/>his purpose.

But in Shakespeare's<lb facs="P11_TL00074"/>time the presentation of a play on the open<lb facs="P11_TL00075"/>platform meant to the Elizabethan playgoers<lb facs="P11_TL00076"/>an actual event; it was not makebelieve but<lb facs="P11_TL00077"/>reality, not to the eye but to the ear, and<lb facs="P11_TL00078"/>thence to the mind. Poetry makes her own<lb facs="P11_TL00079"/>pictures as she makes her own music. She<lb facs="P11_TL00080"/>can reveal the loveliness of nature, and she<lb facs="P11_TL00081"/>can also describe its terrors. Unsurpassed in<lb facs="P11_TL00082"/>power over the imagination is Shakespeare's<lb facs="P11_TL00083"/>description of a storm at sea ( , Act I,<lb facs="P11_TL00084"/>Sc. ii, 3.). Poetry takes precedence of history<lb facs="P11_TL00085"/>in its power to illuminate the past. It mellows<lb facs="P11_TL00086"/>the pictures of memory with a special beauty,<lb facs="P11_TL00087"/>and has a more lasting and subtle influence<lb facs="P11_TL00088"/>over the mind than has either music or painting.<lb facs="P11_TL00089"/>In fact the art of the poet presupposes and<lb facs="P11_TL00090"/>comprehends all the other arts. Not a few of<lb facs="P11_TL00091"/>the most beautiful ideas of Homer furnish no<lb facs="P11_TL00092"/>pictures for the artist. But the superiority of<lb facs="P11_TL00093"/>the poem over the picture depends not only<lb facs="P11_TL00094"/>on technical efficiency such as vocabulary and<lb facs="P11_TL00095"/>metre, but also on whether the writer or<lb facs="P11_TL00096"/>the artist is the better gifted with poetic inspi<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Thus,<lb facs="P12_TL00052"/>in the delivery of verse, it is only the trained<lb facs="P12_TL00053"/>elocutionist who can avoid making havoc of<lb facs="P12_TL00054"/>the author's music and meaning, while abuse<lb facs="P12_TL00055"/>of the cadence becomes in the unskilful a<lb facs="P12_TL00056"/>monotonous infliction on the ear.

In passing, one<lb facs="P48_TL00010"/>may say that one hopes the world will<lb facs="P48_TL00011"/>read it. But it should not be necessary<lb facs="P48_TL00012"/>for the whole world to read it so that<lb facs="P48_TL00013"/>France and Paris may benefit. Antoine,<lb facs="P48_TL00014"/>who it would seem was born in 1858,<lb facs="P48_TL00015"/>should be now 68 years of age. That<lb facs="P48_TL00016"/>is to say he should be now in his prime ;<lb facs="P48_TL00017"/>for according to calculations of London<lb facs="P48_TL00018"/>and Paris a man is in his prime when<lb facs="P48_TL00019"/>he is clcse upon seventy. Then he<lb facs="P48_TL00020"/>may open his mouth to speak, for<lb facs="P48_TL00021"/>tiny know that by this time he is<lb facs="P48_TL00022"/>pretty w ll tired of uttering a word,<lb facs="P48_TL00023"/>and that is the very man to be put<lb facs="P48_TL00024"/>in power at the Com6die Frangaise<lb facs="P48_TL00025"/>and reign silently at its head. He will<lb facs="P48_TL00026"/>see the place and the people tumbling<lb facs="P48_TL00027"/>over each other, and smile on and say<lb facs="P48_TL00028"/>nothing. At least that is what everyone<lb facs="P48_TL00029"/>hopes, but I think, in M. Antoine's<lb facs="P48_TL00030"/>case, we can disillusion them.<lb facs="P48_TL00031"/>I was present at a rehearsal for a<lb facs="P48_TL00032"/>new play which he was directing and<lb facs="P48_TL00033"/>that only a few years ago. Yes, I<lb facs="P48_TL00034"/>think I can safely say the people will<lb facs="P48_TL00035"/>bs disillusioned. I never saw a man<lb facs="P48_TL00036"/>of sixty so terribly active, so fearfully<lb facs="P48_TL00037"/>alive ; not that he lost his temper at<lb facs="P48_TL00038"/>all, but he did not bring it with him<lb facs="P48_TL00039"/>into the theatre. After one is sixty,<lb facs="P48_TL00040"/>one is supposed to totter round a little,<lb facs="P48_TL00041"/>but Antoine seemed to jump from the<lb facs="P48_TL00042"/>stage into the stalls, and from the stalls<lb facs="P48_TL00043"/>on to the stage. I never saw such a<lb facs="P48_TL00044"/>man. I hid as well as I could so that<lb facs="P48_TL00045"/>he should not see me, but he grew so<lb facs="P48_TL00046"/>excited, and through this excitement<lb facs="P48_TL00047"/>seemed so to mould the actors 44 into<lb facs="P48_TL00048"/>something rich and strange " that before<lb facs="P48_TL00049"/>long 1 got up and crept out of the<lb facs="P48_TL00050"/>theatre feeling that I was present at<lb facs="P48_TL00051"/>some sort of private rite which was<lb facs="P48_TL00052"/>going on and which it was none of my<lb facs="P48_TL00053"/>business to witness.<lb facs="P48_TL00054"/>I do not quite get that Antoine in<lb facs="P48_TL00055"/>this book, but there are six or seven<lb facs="P48_TL00056"/>Antoines, and I get most of them here.<lb facs="P48_TL00057"/>He is a dreamer; he is a practical<lb facs="P48_TL00058"/>man; he is a passionate man; he is an<lb facs="P48_TL00059"/>indifferent man ; he is a director who<lb facs="P48_TL00060"/>does not wish to be a profit sharer ;<lb facs="P48_TL00061"/>he is a man who dislikes being a rich<lb facs="P48_TL00062"/>man: he is a man ready to praise<lb facs="P48_TL00063"/>every thing that has anything praise<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

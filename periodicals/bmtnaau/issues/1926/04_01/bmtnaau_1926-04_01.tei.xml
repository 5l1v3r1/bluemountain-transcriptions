When, long<lb facs="P54_TL00014"/>before the war, Mr Jones renounced his London vogue<lb facs="P54_TL00015"/>and withdrew to America, he did so, not because he was<lb facs="P54_TL00016"/>crowded out, but because, like Shakespeare, he fell into a<lb facs="P54_TL00017"/>mood of disillusion with English society which he expressed<lb facs="P54_TL00018"/>in plays compared to which Timon of Athens seemed a<lb facs="P54_TL00019"/>genial optimistic comedy, He went away because he could<lb facs="P54_TL00020"/>not stand us any longer, not in the least because we could<lb facs="P54_TL00021"/>not stand him. When he returned after the war he found<lb facs="P54_TL00022"/>himself for a time excluded from the London West End<lb facs="P54_TL00023"/>theatres ; but so were we all.

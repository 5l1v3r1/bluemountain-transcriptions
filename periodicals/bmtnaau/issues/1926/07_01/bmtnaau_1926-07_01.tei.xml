There<lb facs="P47_TL00028"/>is another reason today. Steam and Electricity<lb facs="P47_TL00029"/>have been discovered.

Even Londoners<lb facs="P47_TL00033"/>know it. Yet the fact is forgotten by them<lb facs="P47_TL00034"/>when wondering how it is that Bain is in<lb facs="P47_TL00035"/>Colombo and Beerbohm in Rapallo. Beerbohm<lb facs="P47_TL00036"/>should of course by rights be in the little<lb facs="P47_TL00037"/>village of Hoop-my-zoom near Rotterdam; but<lb facs="P47_TL00038"/>he once sent a telegram and then he took a<lb facs="P47_TL00039"/>train, and after this, enjoying modern inventions<lb facs="P47_TL00040"/>as do few others, he began to look for a<lb facs="P47_TL00041"/>pleasant place to dwell in where he could<lb facs="P47_TL00042"/>live and let live. But it seems he mustn't or<lb facs="P47_TL00043"/>shouldn't. If this be so, then Barrie should not<lb facs="P47_TL00044"/>be in London; Pinero should be returned<lb facs="P47_TL00045"/>to San Alcazor in Spain; Grein to Emmerich<lb facs="P47_TL00046"/>and I to Paisley.<lb facs="P47_TL00047"/>In fact only ambassadors should be allowed<lb facs="P47_TL00048"/>out of the villages, and these only when sent<lb facs="P47_TL00049"/>out.

" The<lb facs="P55_TL00052"/>Mask " is nothing if not historical, and its object is to<lb facs="P55_TL00053"/>make history live. Mr. Gordon Craig has got together<lb facs="P55_TL00054"/>an astonishing number of references to actors, authors, and<lb facs="P55_TL00055"/>others in connection with the plan, and they make good<lb facs="P55_TL00056"/>mixed reading.

A<lb facs="P55_TL00063"/>run through its pages suggests that there are very many<lb facs="P55_TL00064"/>people interested in the theatre, anxious to do their best<lb facs="P55_TL00065"/>for it, and unable to agree with one another about the<lb facs="P55_TL00066"/>best way. There is an article here by Mr. Ashley Dukes,<lb facs="P55_TL00067"/>reprinted from the " London Mercury," which makes one<lb facs="P55_TL00068"/>quite uncomfortable, so much seems to be going wrong.<lb facs="P55_TL00069"/>Perhaps things are going pretty well with him, but that<lb facs="P55_TL00070"/>isn't enough; he is troubled about these realists, both actors<lb facs="P55_TL00071"/>and authors.

                                    <lb facs="P55_TL00073"/>lism. Of course it is not easy to define it, and I think<lb facs="P55_TL00074"/>that those who are classed as realists must read with some<lb facs="P55_TL00075"/>amusement the tale of their ideals or their limitations.<lb facs="P55_TL00076"/>When anything about realism appears in " The Mask " I<lb facs="P55_TL00077"/>always feel that it is aimed at me, or at least that 1 am<lb facs="P55_TL00078"/>involved in it.

Perhaps they are too polite or<lb facs="P55_TL00081"/>too kind to do so. If it is wrong to write these so-called<lb facs="P55_TL00082"/>realistic plays and novels we must give it up.

Yet I cannot arrive at their conclusion that I<lb facs="P55_TL00092"/>ought not to exist. It appears that Mr. Craig complains<lb facs="P55_TL00093"/>of Mr. Shaw for thrusting other dramatists off the stage.<lb facs="P55_TL00094"/>But as I understand them these enthusiasts want to thrust<lb facs="P55_TL00095"/>me off—to S3y nothing of better men.

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00002"/>will employ experts who know who is who in the world of art,<lb facs="P6_TL00003"/>not merely who is somebody. And then, on discovering who can paint,<lb facs="P6_TL00004"/>who can compose, write, produce and act, the great Dailies being<lb facs="P6_TL00005"/>actually great might treat the information in a rather different way<lb facs="P6_TL00006"/>from that in which they treat the information received about cricketers,<lb facs="P6_TL00007"/>society failings, and affairs of the law courts.<lb facs="P6_TL00008"/>We suggest this pertinently. In the great cities, London, Paris<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>and New York, the arts are suffering a set-back, and it is not a<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>little the fault of the great Dailies. They are, one supposes, always<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>happy when they can draw attention to good work; where they<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>fail is in being unable to recognize anything but " great " work, which<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>nine times out of ten is great rubbish.<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>The last thing the editors of the great Dailies suspect is that<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>they are blind. They believe that they are remarkably clear sighted,<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>and in so many matters this is true; in the matter of the arts they<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>are nearly all of them as blind as bats.<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>For art matters they should allow the great city feeling to dominate<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>their minds.<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>Their great city has great theatres, great concert halls, galleries,<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>publishing establishments, .... le, all are great concerns like great bake<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Aghion; a very bad thing to do, when<lb facs="P24_TL00043"/>one has only a few years in which to do<lb facs="P24_TL00044"/>one's own work; and all I found about<lb facs="P24_TL00045"/>M.

I also<lb facs="P24_TL00053"/>wanted the day and year of his birth, and<lb facs="P24_TL00054"/>the day and year of his death. But these<lb facs="P24_TL00055"/>too are denied me. It is enough to put one<lb facs="P24_TL00056"/>in a rage to think that elimination should be<lb facs="P24_TL00057"/>carried to such excess as this. That of course<lb facs="P24_TL00058"/>was only my first thought. I was not going<lb facs="P24_TL00059"/>to be cross for lack of a couple of dates and<lb facs="P24_TL00060"/>a couple of names.</ab>

That affair of the<lb facs="P42_TL00158"/>Coal is a little knubbly bit in the<lb facs="P42_TL00159"/>Devil's scuttle. The mere thought or<lb facs="P42_TL00160"/>coal is a sure card which he can play<lb facs="P42_TL00161"/>over and over again.

Leave<lb facs="P42_TL00167"/>the fear in and the chances are it will<lb facs="P42_TL00168"/>blaze something lovely in time.

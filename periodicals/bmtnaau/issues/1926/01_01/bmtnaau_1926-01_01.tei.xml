                                    <lb facs="P10_TL00003"/>PIERRE LOUETTE was the gardener-steward of Talma on his estate of<lb facs="P10_TL00004"/>Brunoy. An old soldier, a little brusque, a bit of a grumbler, but of an<lb facs="P10_TL00005"/>upright character, he was, perhaps, more than any one else, impressed by the<lb facs="P10_TL00006"/>noble qualities of his master. Wholly devoted to his humble duties, he could<lb facs="P10_TL00007"/>not estimate either the great tragedian or the favourite of the Emperor, he had<lb facs="P10_TL00008"/>only learned to respect the just and good man.<lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>After the death of Talma, he was indignant at certain slanders, and he<lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>had the idea of combatting them by drawing upon his memories. This good<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>fellow, who had never written anything save accounts and estimates, was,<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>without knowing it, a precious historiographer.

                                       <lb facs="P57_TL00062"/>over Europe. It is astonishing how <lb facs="P57_TL00063"/>slow Europe is to adopt an idea pro- <lb facs="P57_TL00064"/>perly; that is to say, without loss of <lb facs="P57_TL00065"/>time, loss of style and loss of money, <lb facs="P57_TL00066"/>And yet how much time, style and <lb facs="P57_TL00067"/>money would be saved if only Europe <lb facs="P57_TL00068"/>would make it more possible to hurry <lb facs="P57_TL00069"/>up with these new ideas. And they <lb facs="P57_TL00070"/>are never so good, never so perfectly <lb facs="P57_TL00071"/>executed, as the day they are invented, <lb facs="P57_TL00072"/>Architecture reproductions are excel- <lb facs="P57_TL00073"/>lent; its text I find a little less enter- <lb facs="P57_TL00074"/>taining than it might be. <lb facs="P57_TL00075"/>In an interesting article on "The <lb facs="P57_TL00076"/>Architect's Bookshelf " by Mr. M. S. <lb facs="P57_TL00077"/>Briggs is the curious statement that <lb facs="P57_TL00078"/>manuals of building construction are <lb facs="P57_TL00079"/>usually dull and that books on archi- <lb facs="P57_TL00080"/>tecture are best when not illustrated. <lb facs="P57_TL00081"/>But if my Serlio, my Vignola, Vitruvio, <lb facs="P57_TL00082"/>and Pozzo lacked their many hundred <lb facs="P57_TL00083"/>copper plates and woodcuts I should <lb facs="P57_TL00084"/>regret it. For all I know " The Ar- <lb facs="P57_TL00085"/>chitecture of Humanism " cited by Mr. <lb facs="P57_TL00086"/>Briggs may be held to be the best histo- <lb facs="P57_TL00087"/>rical essay of the day; but how a few <lb facs="P57_TL00088"/>designs could have hurt it is not clear <lb facs="P57_TL00089"/>to me. Is it so slight a work that the <lb facs="P57_TL00090"/>least image would distract and lead us <lb facs="P57_TL00091"/>astray ? <lb facs="P57_TL00092"/>The Calendar has no illustrations; <lb facs="P57_TL00093"/>but then it is a lively thing; entertain- <lb facs="P57_TL00094"/>ing too (what daring nowadays!) and <lb facs="P57_TL00095"/>is to my mind quite the best literary <lb facs="P57_TL00096"/>magazine issued in England or Ame- <lb facs="P57_TL00097"/>rica. Is it a success? I ask, for <lb facs="P57_TL00098"/>good things sometimes do not pay. <lb facs="P57_TL00099"/>And yet they should, for when was <lb facs="P57_TL00100"/>there such a number of magazines is- <lb facs="P57_TL00101"/>sued in England, all of which are <lb facs="P57_TL00102"/>trying to publish the best. <lb facs="P57_TL00103"/>Is there room for so many ? <lb facs="P57_TL00104"/>The London Mercury seems to be <lb facs="P57_TL00105"/>having a long innings and would be <lb facs="P57_TL00106"/>more readable were its line less long: <lb facs="P57_TL00107"/>and five inches and one eighth of an <lb facs="P57_TL00108"/>inch is too long a line unless the type <lb facs="P57_TL00109"/>used is a much larger one than the largest <lb facs="P57_TL00110"/>used in " The London Mercury ". <lb facs="P57_TL00111"/>For this reason I much prefer the <lb facs="P57_TL00112"/>double column of The American Mer- <lb facs="P57_TL00113"/>cury9 apparently an only too successful <lb facs="P57_TL00114"/>affair. <lb facs="P57_TL00115"/>But neither of these Mercuries is as <lb facs="P57_TL00116"/>entertaining as " The Calendar" (whose <lb facs="P57_TL00117"/>line, by the way, is good, measuring <lb facs="P57_TL00118"/>four inches). They are too thick— <lb facs="P57_TL00119"/>too full; perhaps too literary; not <lb facs="P57_TL00120"/>nimble enough for Mercury. I am <lb facs="P57_TL00121"/>not conscious of quite enough happi- <lb facs="P57_TL00122"/>ness in the writers; and more sense <lb facs="P57_TL00123"/>of happiness surely could not harm <lb facs="P57_TL00124"/>anyone's prose. <lb facs="P57_TL00125"/>Humor, too, is rather too often ab- <lb facs="P57_TL00126"/>sent from these Mercuries.

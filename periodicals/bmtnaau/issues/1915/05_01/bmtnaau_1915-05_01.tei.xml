Let them<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>dash ahead and try to espress their meanings: but a few moments'<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>thought as to what is the meaning of such words as Rhythm, Drama,<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>Theatre, and so forth, is advisable ; for we come across such words five<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>to fifteen times on a page of a modern critic's book.<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>Take the word " Rhythm " for example. Its chief concern is with Time<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>and Measure. The word Time points to precision ; something clean-cut<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>instead of floppy. Yet the moderrs use the word in a vague sense and<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>seem never to trouble to define to themselves its limits.<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>«« Measure," too; something to do with feet and hands; but only, let<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>us hope, with regulation feet and hands, or, for the law-breakers here,<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>an elephant's foot or a baboon's hand would be Included In the standard,...<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>and the result, anarchy of thought.<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>«« Rhythm " Is used nowadays to imply something to do with everything,<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>from sex to sandals A pity.</ab>

In a book, by<lb facs="P36_TL00030"/>Maurepas, dated 1752, I find recorded a " Requeste du sieur Pollchinelle<lb facs="P36_TL00031"/>a Nosseigneurs de i'Academie francaise etablis au Louvre," in which our<lb facs="P36_TL00032"/>intrepid burattino demands that the right should be conceded to him of<lb facs="P36_TL00033"/>taking part in Academical meetings.<lb facs="P36_TL00034"/>With the great king, Louis xiv, marionettes were on excellent terms<lb facs="P36_TL00035"/>from the time when they went to the palace of Saint-Germain to divert<lb facs="P36_TL00036"/>the melancholy early days of the Dauphin, but that friendship was<lb facs="P36_TL00037"/>becoming cooler and the king was beginning to manifest some displeasure</ab>

The monarch laughed heartily over " Victolre de<lb facs="P39_TL00007"/>Denaln," a bold dialogued " pamphlet," in which Marshal de Villars was<lb facs="P39_TL00008"/>represented under the guise of " Scarabombardone," and bitterly attacked<lb facs="P39_TL00009"/>for his fanfaronnades toutes gasconnes."

In 1746 Le Comte d' Eu, a great master of artillery, invited the<lb facs="P39_TL00016"/>i?urattini to his residence in the castle of Sceaux (the same that had<lb facs="P39_TL00017"/>belonged to the Duchesse de Maine), and desired to manage the wires of<lb facs="P39_TL00018"/>the articulated little "figurine" himself, and also to speak for the dumb<lb facs="P39_TL00019"/>" personaggi." Voltaire, who assisted at that unusual spectacle, became<lb facs="P39_TL00020"/>so much interested in the performance, that he was reconciled " Ipso<lb facs="P39_TL00021"/>facto " with the marionettes, who had been guilty of treating his<lb facs="P39_TL00022"/>" Merope " with such scant respect, and, going behind the curtain, took<lb facs="P39_TL00023"/>hold of the wires and directed them with his own hand and, finally,<lb facs="P39_TL00024"/>dragged Pulcinella to the front and improvised a gracious compliment<lb facs="P39_TL00025"/>for the courteous host:..,<lb facs="P39_TL00026"/>'* Polichinelle de grand coeur,<lb facs="P39_TL00027"/>Prince, vous remercie:<lb facs="P39_TL00028"/>.

As the perfor=<lb facs="P54_TL00020"/>ma nee took place in a closed building artificial light was to a certain<lb facs="P54_TL00021"/>extent used in the spectacle, many candles of all sizes as well as oil<lb facs="P54_TL00022"/>lamps being employed. Daylight was also made use of, and this was done<lb facs="P54_TL00023"/>with much knowledge. Everything was on a grand scale, costly in the<lb facs="P54_TL00024"/>extreme.... superb.

The screens can be made<lb facs="P68_TL00010"/>of any size required.

Three<lb facs="P68_TL00012"/>men in three minutes could move or remove a whole scene and, folded<lb facs="P68_TL00013"/>flat, each screen would take up very little space.

To change a scene would no longer<lb facs="P68_TL00016"/>be to roll up or roll down great canvases, to screw and unscrew bolts,<lb facs="P68_TL00017"/>to adjust and fasten ropes, to remove entirely an elaborate built-up set,<lb facs="P68_TL00018"/>and put another in its place. A complete change of scene can be obtained<lb facs="P68_TL00019"/>merely by rearranging a few screens.

Moreover, that terror of Monday morning in<lb facs="P68_TL00024"/>provincial theatres... the " scene-plot "... is reduced to a simple plan of<lb facs="P68_TL00025"/>the stage marked out in squares with the positions of the screens shown,<lb facs="P68_TL00026"/>by letters or figures, and a quarter of an hour's work ought to make<lb facs="P68_TL00027"/>the whole set of changes clear to the stage-hands.<lb facs="P68_TL00028"/>&amp; Ease and quickness of manipulation are matters that interest the<lb facs="P68_TL00029"/>public no less than the stage-manager and scene-shifters.

                                    <lb facs="P69_TL00003"/>models were made; but indoor and outdoor scenes alike were made each<lb facs="P69_TL00004"/>in a few seconds and In two or three movements* and the purport of<lb facs="P69_TL00005"/>each was unmistakable. Quite extraordinary effects of space and spirit<lb facs="P69_TL00006"/>were obtained; and In this the lighting played a very important part.<lb facs="P69_TL00007"/>For one advantage of these screens is that the light can be directed<lb facs="P69_TL00008"/>from almost any point, and a change of light makes a change of mood,<lb facs="P69_TL00009"/>or even of place. Mr. Craig's own desire appears to be to dispense as<lb facs="P69_TL00010"/>far as possible with any colouring on the screens themselves, partly<lb facs="P69_TL00011"/>because each screen can thus take on a much wider range of characters,<lb facs="P69_TL00012"/>so to speak, than if it were coloured. Most of the colouring would be<lb facs="P69_TL00013"/>obtained by means of coloured lights; and there would be no danger<lb facs="P69_TL00014"/>that a scene painted for one light would be robbed of its effect by being<lb facs="P69_TL00015"/>seen later under another light... an error too often made with scenery<lb facs="P69_TL00016"/>as we know it. Further definition... In a forest scene, for instance... can<lb facs="P69_TL00017"/>be obtained by means of an ingenious device for casting shadows; and<lb facs="P69_TL00018"/>" properties "... chairs, tables, and the like... can be as easily used with<lb facs="P69_TL00019"/>these screens as with the curtains of the Elizabethans or with the<lb facs="P69_TL00020"/>built-up sets of the modern stage .<lb facs="P69_TL00021"/>A street scene that would have done equally well for London, Florence,<lb facs="P69_TL00022"/>or Baghdad was made with three screens in three seconds; and there<lb facs="P69_TL00023"/>seems to be no reason why, with a sparing use of colour and pattern, a<lb facs="P69_TL00024"/>modern drawing-room should not be as clearly suggested as a castle or<lb facs="P69_TL00025"/>a magic island. A proscenium that can be easily enlarged or reduced<lb facs="P69_TL00026"/>forms a subsidiary part of the scheme; and sloping stages could, If<lb facs="P69_TL00027"/>necessary, be made flat for the reception of the screens.<lb facs="P69_TL00029"/>provided, simply and quickly worked, and adaptable to practically all<lb facs="P69_TL00030"/>needs. It is certainly of wonderful effect in the suggestion of place and<lb facs="P69_TL00031"/>mood; and experiment with the models only whets the appetite to see<lb facs="P69_TL00032"/>a stage equipped with the new scenery on the full scale.<lb facs="P69_TL00033"/>Moscow. January 9. 1912.<lb facs="P69_TL00034"/>Every scene in the Hamlet has for its foundation an arrangement of<lb facs="P69_TL00035"/>screens which rise to the full height of the proscenium, and consist<lb facs="P69_TL00036"/>of plain panels devoid of any decoration.

A complete change of scene is created<lb facs="P70_TL00004"/>simply by the rearrangement of these screens, whose value lies, of course,<lb facs="P70_TL00005"/>not so much in themselves as in their formation and the lighting.<lb facs="P70_TL00006"/>Mr. Craig has the singular power of carrying the spiritual significance<lb facs="P70_TL00007"/>of words and dramatic situations beyond the actor to the scene in which<lb facs="P70_TL00008"/>he moves. By the simplest of means he is able, in some mysterious way,<lb facs="P70_TL00009"/>to evoke almost any sensation of time or space, the scenes even in<lb facs="P70_TL00010"/>themselves suggesting variations of human emotion.<lb facs="P70_TL00011"/>Take, for example, the Queen's chamber In the Castle of Elsinore.<lb facs="P70_TL00012"/>Like all the other scenes, it is simply an arrangement of the screens<lb facs="P70_TL00013"/>already mentioned. There is nothing which definitely represents a castle,<lb facs="P70_TL00014"/>still less the locality or period; and yet no one would hesitate as to its<lb facs="P70_TL00015"/>significance... and why? Because it is the spiritual symbol of such a<lb facs="P70_TL00016"/>room. A symbol, moreover, whose form is wholly dependent upon the<lb facs="P70_TL00017"/>action which It surrounds; every line, every space of light and shadow<lb facs="P70_TL00018"/>going directly to heighten and amplify the significance .of that action,<lb facs="P70_TL00019"/>and becoming thereby something more than its mere setting... a vital<lb facs="P70_TL00020"/>and component part no longer separable Jrom the whole. Whatever<lb facs="P70_TL00021"/>Mr. Craig has done he has obviously done it not only with the touch of<lb facs="P70_TL00022"/>an artist, but also with all the care and reverence of a true lover of<lb facs="P70_TL00023"/>Shakespeare.<lb facs="P70_TL00024"/>&amp; To Judge from his work he Is not so much a revolutionary as a<lb facs="P70_TL00025"/>reformer. Far from being an enemy to theatrical tradition, he seems to<lb facs="P70_TL00026"/>realize better than any one how much valuable material for Ills art lies<lb facs="P70_TL00027"/>buried in that limbo of things forgotten. He has gone back over a field<lb facs="P70_TL00028"/>whose fertility so many have ignored, and drawn from it all that Is best<lb facs="P70_TL00029"/>and most useful to him.

It concerns the first performance<lb facs="P75_TL00014"/>held by the <lb facs="P75_TL00015"/>built by the Romans In the reign of Marcus Aurelius (121 A. D. 180).<lb facs="P75_TL00016"/>&amp; xhe Dimensions of the theatre are as follows:<lb facs="P75_TL00017"/>Width 338 feet, depth 254 feet.<lb facs="P75_TL00018"/>Height of facade and of rear wall of stage 120 feet.<lb facs="P75_TL00019"/>Radius of auditorium 182 feet.<lb facs="P75_TL00020"/>&amp; And here Is what M. Janvier, the writer of the article, and who was<lb facs="P75_TL00021"/>present at the performance, has to say:<lb facs="P75_TL00022"/>" The theory has been advanced that the great size of the Greek<lb facs="P75_TL00023"/>stage, and of the palace in its rear which was its permanent set of<lb facs="P75_TL00024"/>scenery, so dwarfed the figures of the actors that buskins and padding<lb facs="P75_TL00025"/>were used in order to make the persons of the players more in keeping<lb facs="P75_TL00026"/>with their surroundings. With submission, I hold that this would have<lb facs="P75_TL00027"/>been, in one way, out of proportion with the background. If used at all<lb facs="P75_TL00028"/>in tragedy, buskins and pads probably were used to make the heroic<lb facs="P75_TL00029"/>characters of the drama literally greater than the other characters.<lb facs="P75_TL00030"/>«« In point of fact, the majestic height of the scene did not dwarf the<lb facs="P75_TL00031"/>human figures sustaining serious parts. The effect was precisely ihe<lb facs="P75_TL00032"/>contrary. Mademoiselle standing solitary in that great open space,<lb facs="P75_TL00033"/>with the play of golden light upon her, became also heroic. With the<lb facs="P75_TL00034"/>characters in " (Edlpus " and " Antigone " the result was the same: the<lb facs="P75_TL00035"/>somber grandeur of the tragedies was enlarged by the majesty of the</ab>

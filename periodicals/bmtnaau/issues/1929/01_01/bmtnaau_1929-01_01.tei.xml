As she was still young when I<lb facs="P15_TL00005"/>married her, I perceived none of her evil<lb facs="P15_TL00006"/>propensities, and deemed myself a little less<lb facs="P15_TL00007"/>unfortunate than the majority of those who<lb facs="P15_TL00008"/>contract similar engagements. Neither did<lb facs="P15_TL00009"/>my eagerness diminish after marriage ; yet f<lb facs="P15_TL00010"/>found so much indifference in her that I<lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>began to perceive all my precautions had<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>been useless, and that the feelings she had<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>for me were far indeed from those my<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>happiness demanded. Reproaching myself<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>with a sensitiveness -which seemed ridiculous<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>in a husband, I ascribed to her disposition<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>that which was really due to her want of<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>affection lor me; yet 1 had but too many<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>opportunities of perceiving my error, for the<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>mad passion she contracted soon afterward for<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>the Comte de Guiehe occasioned too much<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>commotion to leave me even this appearance<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>of tranquillity. So soon as 1 knew the truth,<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>finding it impossible to change her, I spared<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>no endeavour to conquer myself. Employing<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>all the strength of mind I could command, I<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>summoned to my aid everything that might<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>console me. Deeming her a person whose<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>sole merit had lain in her innocence, and<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>whose infidelity robbed her of all charm, I<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>resolved henceforth to live with her as an<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>honourable man whose wife is a coquette,<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>and who is well persuaded that, whatever<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>may be said, his reputation is not affected<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>by the misconduct of his spouse. But I<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>had the mortification to discover that a woman<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>without great beauty, who owed what little<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>intelligence she possessed to the education I<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>had given her could in one instant destroy<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>all my philosophy. Her presence made me<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>forget all my resolutions ; the first words she<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>said in her defence left me so convinced that<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>my suspicions were ill founded that f asked<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>her pardon for having been so credulous.<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>However, my kindness wrought no change<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>m her, and in the end I determined to live<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>with her as if she were not my wife ; but if<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>you knew what I suffer, you would pity me.<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>My passion has reached such a point as to<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>cause me to sympathise with her ; and when<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>I realise how impossible it is for me to<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>conquer my feelings for her, 1 then tell myself<lb facs="P15_TL00053"/>that she has, perhaps, a like difficulty in<lb facs="P15_TL00054"/>overcoming her love coquetry; so I find<lb facs="P15_TL00055"/>myself more disposed to pity than to blame,</ab>

But the<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>poets have been merciless only to love itself,<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>never to the human beings. Poets do not<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>take sides ; — the writers of " Memoirs " are<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>too often apt to do so. Neither do all men<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>or all women hand over their secret to us, for<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>it is, after all, they know, part of a far<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>deeper secret,... the whole secret of life.

She was loved by and loved<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>Maurice de Saxe.(l) She was hated by and<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>(1 hope) hated the Duchesse de Bouillon.<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>The Duchess is supposed to have had her<lb facs="P16_TL00052"/>poisoned.

This has not<lb facs="P31_TL00046"/>been done.

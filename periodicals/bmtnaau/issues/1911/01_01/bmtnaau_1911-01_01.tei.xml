At each rise in the road the actors got down and pushed against<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>the wheels. They knew chance resting-places and strange hostelries, all the hazards of the<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>great roads. They forded rivers and climbed mountains • they slept in barns or with the<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>stars for their roof. They saw the sky blaze at midnight with arquebus-shots and the<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>village children run after them with shouts. They passed from hamlet to hamlet, from<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>experience to experience, from success to success. And then the poor rope-dancers of<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>yore, the thin vagabonds with the disjointed bodies, the wasted, wandering sons of mud<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>and night, who wiped their noses with their fingers and knelt in the dust of the road<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>at the tinkling of the Angelus, found the great gates of palaces opened to them, and<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>entered in.

Later, when a comic art arose<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>with fixed and academic rules, Italian Comedy remained pure fancy unrestrained.

Together with Italian music it was henceforth<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>the ornament of every Court, the mainstay of every f§te, the classic diversion of the old<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>regime. But Venice had been the birthplace of Pantaloon, and the home of that incredible<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>Andrea Calmo, who numbered Tintoretto and Aretino and Michael Angelo among his friends.<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>She had shunned tragedy as the plague, and disregarded the written comedy with its odour<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>of the lamp and its reminiscences of Latin.

This " naturae laborantis opus ", as Columbine expressed it in the<lb facs="P12_TL00048"/>Chinois of Regnard and Dufresny, was sometimes accomplished. More often no miracle was<lb facs="P12_TL00049"/>needed to attain the result.

"Of<lb facs="P12_TL00058"/>ten who try to act", said Niccolo Barbieri, "nine are failures", and on these nine, who<lb facs="P12_TL00059"/>composed rather than interpreted it, the success of the piece depended.

Reading them today they no longer make us<lb facs="P25_TL00010"/>laugh; for instance it almost annoys us that it should ever have been possible to laugh at<lb facs="P25_TL00011"/>hearing this order of the Captain to the paper merchant: " for a sheet of paper send me<lb facs="P25_TL00012"/>44 the skin of the dragon Hesperio'; for a pen the horn of the rhinoceros; for ink the tears<lb facs="P25_TL00013"/>44 of the crocodile; for sand, the desert; for wax the foam of Cerberus and for seal the<lb facs="P25_TL00014"/>44 petrifying head of Medusa".

The popular Italian comedy had<lb facs="P29_TL00024"/>there the effect of a gust of wind sweeping away the mist of prejudice, and it was perhaps<lb facs="P29_TL00025"/>not without credit to Ganassa that Lope de Vega, (who at the time of this visit was about<lb facs="P29_TL00026"/>twelve years old,) could say, " When I set out to write a play I lock up the rules under<lb facs="P29_TL00027"/>" ten keys and banish Plautus and Terence from my room for fear that they should murmur<lb facs="P29_TL00028"/>" against me. I write following the style of those who seek the applause of the public,<lb facs="P29_TL00029"/>" since after all, seeing that it is the public which pays, it seems to me only just to speak<lb facs="P29_TL00030"/>" to it, even in an illiterate manner, but always so as to amuse ".</ab>

In 1601<lb facs="P36_TL00018"/>he married at Milan the eighteen=year=o!d Virginia Ramponi, who, aided by the intelligent<lb facs="P36_TL00019"/>direction of her husband, was, under the name of Florinda, to make it seem that the loss<lb facs="P36_TL00020"/>of her mother=in=law was not entirely irreparable.

"We<lb facs="P39_TL00031"/>"must never forget that the priority of this ingenious and piquant imitation of nature<lb facs="P39_TL00032"/>" belongs to Italy, and that, without that rich and interesting precedent, Moliere would<lb facs="P39_TL00033"/>" never have created the real French comedy " says George Sand, and there have not been<lb facs="P39_TL00034"/>lacking Rajnas to search into the reliquaries of the Commedia delTArte and to find there<lb facs="P39_TL00035"/>sketches for plots, scenes, episodes, types, characters, which, in the hand of the genial<lb facs="P39_TL00036"/>playwright, became Tartuffe, the " Malade imaginaire ", f« George Dandin ", " Trissotin<lb facs="P39_TL00037"/>" Sganarelle ", " Scapin ". &amp;<lb facs="P39_TL00038"/>The great artist has added the colours to the outline drawn in charcoal, so that their<lb facs="P39_TL00039"/>vitality is thus no longer perishable.

The wedding of the Duke, William IV with Renata di Lorena, was being<lb facs="P40_TL00013"/>celebrated and one fine day the Duke took it into his head to have a play performed the<lb facs="P40_TL00014"/>next night. He asked one of Maestro Orlando who in his turn asked his colleague Trojano<lb facs="P40_TL00015"/>to help him. No sooner said than done. They devised the " dilettevole soggetto.' and per<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P40_TL00016"/>formed on the following evening an improvised comedy in Italian in presence of all the<lb facs="P40_TL00017"/>" most serene ladies ", and, although the majority did not understand what was said, the<lb facs="P40_TL00018"/>" Magnifico Veneziano " Messer Orlando di Lasso with his " Zanne " succeeded so well as<lb facs="P40_TL00019"/>to convulse them all with laughter. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P40_TL00020"/>The parts were distributed as follows: Messer Orlando himself was " the Magnificent<lb facs="P40_TL00021"/>Messer Pantalone di Bisognosi"; M.

The servant<lb facs="P40_TL00025"/>of Polidoro was Don Carlo Livizzano; the servant of the Spaniard was Giorgio Dori da<lb facs="P40_TL00026"/>Trento; the courtesan, Polidoro's lover, called Camilla, was the Marchese di Malaspina ;<lb facs="P40_TL00027"/>her servant, Ercole Terzo ; there was also a French servant. To enliven the performance<lb facs="P40_TL00028"/>yet more the play was varied by interludes and musical madrigals by Lasso. &amp; •£?<lb facs="P40_TL00029"/>&amp; In Germany it cannot be said that the seeds of the Commedia dell'Arte fell upon<lb facs="P40_TL00030"/>fruitful ground. On the other hand in 1527 there crossed to England a company led by a<lb facs="P40_TL00031"/>Mantuan Harlequin, Drusiano Martinelli, brother of a yet more celebrated Harlequin who<lb facs="P40_TL00032"/>called himself " Dominus Arlecchinorum " and, owing to the queen of France having acted<lb facs="P40_TL00033"/>as Godmother to a daughter of his, called her " commare " and signed himself<lb facs="P40_TL00034"/>"Arlecchino compadre christianissimo ". At the court of Elizabeth it is probable that the<lb facs="P40_TL00035"/>two rival buffoons Tarleton and Wilton learned from him to improvise on mere '♦scenarios"<lb facs="P40_TL00036"/>and to compose these. &amp; a&amp; &amp;<lb facs="P40_TL00037"/>Shakespeare did not came to London until about eight years later. It is known how<lb facs="P40_TL00038"/>familiar he was with our novelists and playwrights and how he drew from that source<lb facs="P40_TL00039"/>plots, scenes and situations. The " Comedy of Errors " is derived from the " Menechmi"<lb facs="P40_TL00040"/>through the medium of an Italian imitation; the "Taming of the Shrew" is in great part<lb facs="P40_TL00041"/>based on the " Suppositi" of Ariosto, and even "Romeo and Juliet" recalls in more than<lb facs="P40_TL00042"/>one place (in one's zeal to appear discreet one must not be unjust 1) the 'Hadriana' of<lb facs="P40_TL00043"/>Luigi Groto. &amp; jz? &lt;£? .g?<lb facs="P40_TL00044"/>Nor are traces of this imitation of our popular Commedia rare or obscure in his works.<lb facs="P40_TL00045"/>In fact when, in " Othello " (1-2) lago calls Brabanzio " il Magnifico " it seems to me that<lb facs="P40_TL00046"/>he wishes to treat him as Pantaloon rather than simply, as commentators interpret it,<lb facs="P40_TL00047"/>to indicate by that title his senatorial dignity. But there is yet a better example. Captain<lb facs="P40_TL00048"/>Parolles in the comedy "All's well that Ends Well" who carries "the whole theorick of<lb facs="P40_TL00049"/>war In the knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of his dagger," is no other<lb facs="P40_TL00050"/>than our Captain Spavento, and one would say that the scene in which, having out of<lb facs="P40_TL00051"/>cowardice fallen into the hands of his own soldiers who have frightened him and who affect<lb facs="P40_TL00052"/>a barbarous language, is dragged with a bandage across his eyes in front of his own ge<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

So also we find our "Spanish<lb facs="P40_TL00055"/>Captain" in that boastful and gallant Spaniard in "Love's Labour Lost." It is enough to hear<lb facs="P40_TL00056"/>how he gives an account of his love to his valet. " I will hereupon confess I am in love;<lb facs="P40_TL00057"/>" and as it is base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my<lb facs="P40_TL00058"/>" sword against the humour off affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of<lb facs="P40_TL00059"/>"it, I would take desire prisoner, and reasom him to any French courtier for a new devised</ab>

In the opinion of the Florentine people and, what is yet more important, in that of<lb facs="P22_TL00043"/>the women, Cecchi has conquered and surpassed Cino who was rather a poeta a scacca=<lb facs="P22_TL00044"/>far a. &amp;<lb facs="P22_TL00045"/>(Scaccafava; a name given to a kind of slipper.

Buonanni and the<lb facs="P22_TL00047"/>family of Cini, so popular and so successful; then Lotto and Cecchi, and other learned men,<lb facs="P22_TL00048"/>have lost courage, this being a bitter pill for them, while il Lasca winks and grins.<lb facs="P22_TL00049"/>Each expecting to be the first called for, had prepared his play; some had shown their<lb facs="P22_TL00050"/>work to this one, others to that one, hoping from hour to hour to be summoned ; but<lb facs="P22_TL00051"/>the people, seeing the glory of the Zanni rise to the very skies, without wanting to hear<lb facs="P22_TL00052"/>or know any thing further, refuse to see any other plays. So let anyone who has composed<lb facs="P22_TL00053"/>one give it to these actors, begging them to accept it; and they will act It so well that<lb facs="P22_TL00054"/>the smallest trifle will appear a fine piece of work. The voices, actions and gestures of<lb facs="P22_TL00055"/>these players are so charming that they amaze the people and make them almost split their<lb facs="P22_TL00056"/>sides with laughter. I do not believe that any actors of the past, whether in Rome or in<lb facs="P22_TL00057"/>Athens, ever performed so charmingly and gracefully on the ancient stage.

The comedy was acted, and<lb facs="P44_TL00024"/>the three beautiful princesses born of the three enchanted oranges made all Venice crowd<lb facs="P44_TL00025"/>to the theatre of St. Angelo.-<lb facs="P44_TL00026"/>4<lb facs="P44_TL00027"/>It may easily be imagined, that Goldoni and Chiari were not spared in the " Tre Aranci ".<lb facs="P44_TL00028"/>Gozzi found means to introduce in it a good many of their theatrical absurdities, and<lb facs="P44_TL00029"/>exposed them to public derision. The Venetians, like all other Italians, do not greatly<lb facs="P44_TL00030"/>care for the labour of searching after truth, and their imagination runs too often away<lb facs="P44_TL00031"/>with them, while their judgement lies dormant. But point out sense to them, and they<lb facs="P44_TL00032"/>will instantly seize it.

The<lb facs="P59_TL00041"/>first ran one hundred and twenty nights, the<lb facs="P59_TL00042"/>second one hundred and seventy, the third<lb facs="P59_TL00043"/>has run for one hundred and thirty and is<lb facs="P59_TL00044"/>still running.<lb facs="P59_TL00045"/>English managers complain that there are<lb facs="P59_TL00046"/>no plays to be had for love or money.

Why managers refused<lb facs="P59_TL00068"/>that play was that they didn't know how to act<lb facs="P59_TL00069"/>it, and that is the reason why most piays are<lb facs="P59_TL00070"/>refused by actor managers of today. &amp;<lb facs="P59_TL00071"/>In an Interview lately given to a London<lb facs="P59_TL00072"/>journal Sir Arthur told everybody pretty<lb facs="P59_TL00073"/>clearly that he has experienced strange<lb facs="P59_TL00074"/>things in the stage world of London.

This is all I have to report from London<lb facs="P59_TL00078"/>A tale about nothing,... and its success. There<lb facs="P59_TL00079"/>is nothing which guides either playwrights,<lb facs="P59_TL00080"/>the public or the managers; nothing which<lb facs="P59_TL00081"/>a critic can criticize but everything that he<lb facs="P59_TL00082"/>can regret.

BECAUSE, in answer to the question, What are Straparola's 44 Nights"?<lb facs="P66_TL00017"/>we reply: They are a collection of bright, rollicking stories in the style of<lb facs="P66_TL00018"/>Boccaccio...now pathetic, anon brimming over with boisterous fun and Rabe-<lb facs="P66_TL00019"/>laisian humour. The laugh rings true, the gallantry is never low-minded, the<lb facs="P66_TL00020"/>morality is sometimes indeed high, and In any case there is no canting smirk<lb facs="P66_TL00021"/>lurking at the corner of the lip: the work reeks with the joy and gaiety<lb facs="P66_TL00022"/>of life.<lb facs="P66_TL00023"/>3. BECAUSE the work consists of two stout Bvo volumes of some 800 pages<lb facs="P66_TL00024"/>in all: and, being a magnificent piece of typography, executed In red and<lb facs="P66_TL00025"/>black throughout, will please all who like fine printing. The initial letters<lb facs="P66_TL00026"/>are in red, the titles of the chapters in red, also the running titles on each<lb facs="P66_TL00027"/>page ; the paper is fine, and of the best English make and quality.<lb facs="P66_TL00028"/>4. BECAUSE, further, to add still more to the literary value of the book,<lb facs="P66_TL00029"/>the Translator has given an exhaustive Introduction, and been prodigal of<lb facs="P66_TL00030"/>notes elucidating names of those persons and places not generally known,<lb facs="P66_TL00031"/>and drawing attention to analogous stories in Boccaccio, Shakespeare, 44 The<lb facs="P66_TL00032"/>Arabian Nights," thus making the work useful to the scholar and student,<lb facs="P66_TL00033"/>as well as agreeable to the general public who read for the sake of pleasure<lb facs="P66_TL00034"/>and amusement.<lb facs="P66_TL00035"/>5. BECAUSE the price is for the moment absurdly low for two such noble<lb facs="P66_TL00036"/>volumes, whereof the value will increase in proportion as the books get scarcer,<lb facs="P66_TL00037"/>like stocks and shares that fluctuate according to the well-known law of<lb facs="P66_TL00038"/>supply and demand.<lb facs="P66_TL00039"/>6.

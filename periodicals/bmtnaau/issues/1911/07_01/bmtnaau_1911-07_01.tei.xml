We of the theatre dislike Mr Shaw only when he brings his social<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>propaganda on to the stage, for it explains too nicely how little Mr<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>Shaw understands the nature of the Theatre, and it is hardly necessary<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>to repeat here that the Theatre is a temple or house for Art, and Art has<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>never flourished when in connection with Social or Political reform<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>*<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>it having nothing in common with either, (i.)<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>Mr Shaw in his Preface says that M.

They profess never to have heard of M.

As artists, as creators who fly with<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>the angels, they will be unheard of.

And we are-all old enough and and wise enough, I<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>think, to realise now that by beauty we mean things not only externally<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>beautiful but beautiful in spirit. Thus things become beautiful in<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>hands that know what beauty of touch is and all things are beautiful<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>as they pass through the thoughts of a really human being...and great<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>artists are more human than M.

But the bad is so abominably bad that it ruins the splendour of<lb facs="P29_TL00018"/>the whole effort. <lb facs="P29_TL00019"/>&amp; Mr Brady invites Mr Charles A.

Mr Brady begins advertising<lb facs="P29_TL00028"/>An admirable art In its own way, but, wedded to architecture, the<lb facs="P29_TL00029"/>results are appalling. And Mr Brady's advertising is worthy of an amateur<lb facs="P29_TL00030"/>advertiser, not of the professional. He has fixed up two of the commonest<lb facs="P29_TL00031"/>type of electric advertising frames at each side of this beautiful new place,<lb facs="P29_TL00032"/>and one over the entrance door.

A delightful evening would<lb facs="P44_TL00025"/>pass in silence. It would be quite sensible for once, but the actors would<lb facs="P44_TL00026"/>be alarmed and believe that the audience had felt nothing, the critics<lb facs="P44_TL00027"/>cocksure that the actors were unpopular, and the wlg=makers would<lb facs="P44_TL00028"/>spread the report that the play was a dismal failure.

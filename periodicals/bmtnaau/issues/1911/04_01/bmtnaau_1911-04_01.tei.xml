I think he was playing the part of a cook. He looked well, he seemed<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>interesting ; he seemed out of the usual run. Then only last year I met him again in<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>London. He said that one of the three famous playwrights had promised to write him<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>a part. He was worrying about that part; it didn't hurry up enough for him; he was out of<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>•work he was one of ten thousand others and was waiting for Barrie or Shaw<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>or Pinero, 1 forget which, to write him a part. A nice fellow, too ; but, great Jupiter,<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>Apollo, Dionysus, the young fellow was waiting &amp;<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>&amp; He'll wait right enough. Patience, what a vice it has become, what a blanket<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>to put out the fire, what a cloak under which to hide the ashes of incapacity. And that's<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>what thousands of English actors are doing... waiting for what they call " their chance ".<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>If only I could help them, if only one could destroy these large liars who enslave the<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>young fellows with their promises of a future to him who has patience to wait for<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>a part. <lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>It seems that I am to have my school very shortly and 1 shall then be able to do some<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

I cannot but feel convinced that the right way of producing a play<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>is to produce it forwards.<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>&amp; Yet some of the London managers at that time were producing plays backwards; calling<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>jerkiness rhythm, gaudiness taste, amateurishness professionalism and reality, Art.<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>And they are still up to these tricks, though everyone knows that confusion Is not order,<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>nor the haphazard lawful in a work of art.<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>&amp; Everyone acknowledges that it is wrong to put a bunch of ;real roses in the painted<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>hand of a painted figure on a canvas at the Royal Academy. It would be anarchy to act<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>in such away; and yet such an anarchy is permitted In the London theatres. It is to<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>destroy anarchy in the theatre, to expose the revolutionary principles which have disgraced<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>our theatre for some time that I am working; therefore when my school is built it will<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>be dedicated not to Revolution but to Order, and we shall teach obedience there, not<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>disobedience, to what always was and will be the ruling principle of the Art of the Theatre;<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>self-reliance and collaboration and quite a number of minor accomplishments, but we<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>shall not encourage any of our pupils to wait patiently until Sir Arthur Pinero writes him<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>a part or Mr. Barrie sees an opening for him in his next play. If there are no openings,<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>no parts, we will make them, for we shall open wide the larger doors of the future to the<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>actor so that he may with self-reliance know that all parts are ready for the comedian<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>who cares to undergo the training which gives the power to improvise, f</ab>

Besides, I do not see the object of insis®<lb facs="P19_TL00005"/>ting to such an extent upon the hypothesis of a historical connection. At a time when a<lb facs="P19_TL00006"/>Spanish soldier, Miguel de Cervantes, succeeded In creating the genial type of the hidalgo<lb facs="P19_TL00007"/>Don Quixote de la Manclia who has also many points of resemblance to our Captain, could<lb facs="P19_TL00008"/>not the Italians, who had daily before their eyes these blustering fellows swollen with pride,<lb facs="P19_TL00009"/>create a 44 Capitano Spavento della ValFlnferna " or a self=styled 44 Matamoros " just as the<lb facs="P19_TL00010"/>Greeks and Romans had been able previously to create a 44 Miles Gloriosus " ?<lb facs="P19_TL00011"/>And besides, who is there to certify that the 44 Miles " was a popular type and not<lb facs="P19_TL00012"/>rather a creature of the individual imagination of the poet, having, however, a counterpart<lb facs="P19_TL00013"/>In the contemporary life ? Might he not be, for instance, a creation such as 44 Fanfulla"<lb facs="P19_TL00014"/>or 44 Don Abbondio " 01* Don Quixote himself ? Whereas It is certain that the Italian Captain<lb facs="P19_TL00015"/>was the personificatien of a sentiment common to all Italians of the Cinquecento : a type<lb facs="P19_TL00016"/>first presented by an actor, and then developed to suit their own taste by the people<lb facs="P19_TL00017"/>themselves, approving with applause and correcting with hisses: and it seems to me that<lb facs="P19_TL00018"/>there! is nothing either unnatural or improbable in admitting that our swaggering fellow<lb facs="P19_TL00019"/>may have sprung spontaneously from the inner consciousness of the Italian people of the<lb facs="P19_TL00020"/>Cinquecento, without a shadow of plagiarism.<lb facs="P19_TL00021"/>&amp; It is conceivable, however, that the Idea may have been suggested to the actor who<lb facs="P19_TL00022"/>first presented that type 011 the stage through the reading of Plautus (1.) as was the case with<lb facs="P19_TL00023"/>many other literary and artistic phenomena of the Renaissance; with musical drama, for<lb facs="P19_TL00024"/>example, the first idea of which sprang from the reading of the Greek tragedians.<lb facs="P19_TL00025"/>&amp; This is probable, but it excludes the hypothesis of the silent tradition of more than<lb facs="P19_TL00026"/>seventeen centuries : and one must also beware of falling into an optical delusion. If one<lb facs="P19_TL00027"/>observes the type of the Captain in the plays of the Cinque® or Seicento one hears again<lb facs="P19_TL00028"/>in them the Plautinian 44 Miles ". For example, .... to cite some of them,.... in the<lb facs="P19_TL00029"/>comedies of Glambattista della Porta, the Captains 44 Basilisco " from the "Furiosa" (1609)<lb facs="P19_TL00030"/>44 Parabola " from the 44 Moro " (1607) 44 Gorgoleone " from the 44 ChSappinaria " (1609),<lb facs="P19_TL00031"/>44 Martibellonio " from the 44 Two Rival Brothers " (1601) 44 Trasiloco " from the 44 Olimpia "<lb facs="P19_TL00032"/>(1589), and 44 Dante " and 44 Pantaleone" from the 44 Fantesca " (1597) and the 44 Cintia "<lb facs="P19_TL00033"/>(1601), seem but pupils of 44 Pirgopolinice " who have inherited from their master his invin®<lb facs="P19_TL00034"/>cible bravery and his incessant boasting. je?<lb facs="P19_TL00035"/>But one cannot, on account of this hint of imitation, affirm that there have been two<lb facs="P19_TL00036"/>different manifestations of that type in Italy, the one derived from the literary tradition,<lb facs="P19_TL00037"/>the other spontaneous and popular. On the contrary, it seems certain that, when the regular<lb facs="P19_TL00038"/>Commedia appropriated from the public squares the already-formed masks and types and<lb facs="P19_TL00039"/>with them the Captain, noting the likeness which he bore to the ancient Plautinian<lb facs="P19_TL00040"/>character, it retouched the sixteenth century braggart with the vivid and characteristic<lb facs="P19_TL00041"/>colours of the Roman soldier, and this retinting has occasioned an optical delusion in<lb facs="P19_TL00042"/>the later critics.<lb facs="P19_TL00043"/>A famous art critic, Signor Ugo Fleres, puts forward a most reasonable and ingenious<lb facs="P19_TL00044"/>comparison; 441t seems to me", he says, "that the 44Guappo" stands in the same relation to<lb facs="P19_TL00045"/>44 the 44 Capitan Fracassa " as this latter to the 44 Miles gloriosus ". That is to say, that as<lb facs="P19_TL00046"/>44 the 44 Miles was born from the insolence of the Roman soldier and the 44 Fracassa " from<lb facs="P19_TL00047"/>" the boasting of the Spanish soldier, (and perhaps also the Basque) so is the 44 Guappo "<lb facs="P19_TL00048"/>44 born of the braggings of our 44 lazzarone (2.)

When scarcely twelve, being opposed by his parents in his desire to become a painter,<lb facs="P21_TL00026"/>he ran away from his home, and, having no resources, joined a company of gypsies or players<lb facs="P21_TL00027"/>bound for Italy. He reached Florence and there began to study, but, being recognised by<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>some merchants, he was sent back to his father. This happened more than once until he at<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>last obtained permission to remain in Italy. He returned later on to Nancy in the service<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>of Henry Duke of Lorraine, and this prince's favour, added to his own talents and charm<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>of character, quickly won him success.<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>jg/ After the capture of Nancy he was urged to engrave a souvenir of this conquest, but<lb facs="P21_TL00033"/>replied proudly that 44 he would sooner cut off his thumb than do anything contrary to<lb facs="P21_TL00034"/>the honour of his prince and country ". Louis XIII, admiring the artist's fine spirit, accepted<lb facs="P21_TL00035"/>this refusal and even offered him a pension of five thousand francs to enter his own service,<lb facs="P21_TL00036"/>but Callot, preferring liberty to all else, refused. *&amp; &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P21_TL00037"/>His works are far too numerous to name, but those which have a peculiar interest for<lb facs="P21_TL00038"/>the student of the theatre are his 44 Balli di Sfessania " (many of the figures from which<lb facs="P21_TL00039"/>appear in this and the preceding number of The Mask) and Illustrations of pageants and<lb facs="P21_TL00040"/>scenes from plays.

But I protest that, far from being puffed up on account of such rare talents,<lb facs="P27_TL00047"/>44 I have always considered them as the result of my lucky star rather than of merit, and<lb facs="P27_TL00048"/>44 if anything has been able to beguile my spirit to such a comparison, it was nothing else<lb facs="P27_TL00049"/>44 but the pleasure of hearing myself applauded after the inimitable Signor Domenico, who<lb facs="P27_TL00050"/>44 carried to such a pitch the excellence of the burlesque in the part of Arlecchino that<lb facs="P27_TL00051"/>44 whoever may have seen him act must always find something to criticise in the most<lb facs="P27_TL00052"/>44 famous Ar leech in os of his time ".

There is no one who cannot<lb facs="P31_TL00015"/>learn by heart and recite upon the stage that which he has learned, but something very<lb facs="P31_TL00016"/>different is required in the Italian actor. To say a 6i good Italian actor " is as much as to<lb facs="P31_TL00017"/>say a man who has depth, who plays more from imagination than from memory, who<lb facs="P31_TL00018"/>composes, while acting, all that he says : who seconds and supports whoever is with him<lb facs="P31_TL00019"/>on the stage, that is to say, fits his words and actions so perfectly to those of his comrade<lb facs="P31_TL00020"/>that he instantly enters into all the acting and movements which the other iequlres of<lb facs="P31_TL00021"/>him In such a manner as to make everyone believe that, they were pre-arranged.<lb facs="P31_TL00022"/>It is by no means the same with an actor who plays merely from memory, fie never<lb facs="P31_TL00023"/>comes upon the stage but to recite as quickly as possible that which he has learned by<lb facs="P31_TL00024"/>heart, and with which he is so much occupied that, without paying attention to the<lb facs="P31_TL00025"/>movements and gestures of his fellows, he always goes his own way, in a furious hurry<lb facs="P31_TL00026"/>to deliver himself of his role as if it were a burden which fatigues him too<lb facs="P31_TL00027"/>much. One may say that such actors are like scholars who come, trembling, to recite a<lb facs="P31_TL00028"/>lesson which they have carefully conned; or rather, they are like echoes, who would<lb facs="P31_TL00029"/>never speak if others had not spoken before them. They are actors in name, but<lb facs="P31_TL00030"/>useless, and a burden to their company. I compare an actor of this kind to a paralised<lb facs="P31_TL00031"/>arm, which, however, useless, always bears the name of an arm. The only difference which<lb facs="P31_TL00032"/>I find between the dead arm and the useless member of the comedy is that, if the former<lb facs="P31_TL00033"/>be of no service to the body it is equally certain that it does not receive from it any<lb facs="P31_TL00034"/>nourishment, this being divided among the members which fulfil their dutyi but the latter<lb facs="P31_TL00035"/>(although quite useless to the theatre), does not fail to receive as much nourishment as the<lb facs="P31_TL00036"/>actors who work more and are more necessary. j&amp;<lb facs="P31_TL00037"/>It may be said then in regard to the useless actors of whom almost all companies are<lb facs="P31_TL00038"/>full, that they are people without life and without art, whom a capricious patronage or<lb facs="P31_TL00039"/>an extraordinary good luck has raised to their position, and who henceforth no longer<lb facs="P31_TL00040"/>regard the theatre but from the financial side and not from the point of view of the work<lb facs="P31_TL00041"/>it demands; always drawing a clear distinction, however, between these actors in name<lb facs="P31_TL00042"/>and those real actors, who, though they indeed learn by heart, yet, after the example of<lb facs="P31_TL00043"/>excellent painters, know how to seek art with art, and who charm the spectators by their<lb facs="P31_TL00044"/>beauty of voice, truth of gesture, perfect flexibility of manner, and a certain gracious,<lb facs="P31_TL00045"/>easy and natural air with which they accompany all their movements and which they impart<lb facs="P31_TL00046"/>to all they utter.<lb facs="P31_TL00047"/>But I am wandering far from my subject &lt;£? <lb facs="P31_TL00048"/>jg?

He gave me three tickets and I went all alone to the<lb facs="P33_TL00048"/>play. As the people were crowding round the door of the parterre to buy tickets I drew two<lb facs="P33_TL00049"/>strangers aside and I said to them: " Gentlemen, I had taken two tickets for two of my<lb facs="P33_TL00050"/>friends who have not turned up. They are thirty sous apiece for the gallery; if you like I<lb facs="P33_TL00051"/>will give you the two for thirty sous; " They accepted the offer, gave me thirty sous which<lb facs="P33_TL00052"/>I put in my pocket, and we all three entered the theatre together. z&amp;<lb facs="P33_TL00053"/>I sat myself down in the middle of the first row of the gallery.

If that idol of pecuniary interest is attacked (with justice it may<lb facs="P37_TL00026"/>be and the best reasons), you will not find in them a shadow of these fine sentiments.<lb facs="P37_TL00027"/>The merest scent of coming profit makes them disregard and blindly sacrifice the persons<lb facs="P37_TL00028"/>who have done them good ; the reputation of the whole world is as nothing to them then ;<lb facs="P37_TL00029"/>they take no thought of the damage they may have to suffer in the future, blinded by<lb facs="P37_TL00030"/>greediness, lulled into security for the time being, and hoping to avoid impending disasters<lb facs="P37_TL00031"/>by address and ingenuity. The present moment is all that actors think of. <lb facs="P37_TL00032"/>Hot and choleric temperaments reveal their true selves more readily among this class<lb facs="P37_TL00033"/>of people. The cool-headed are more difficult to fathom. Their system of cozenage is not<lb facs="P37_TL00034"/>only applied to persons outside the profession, from whom they expect material gains; it<lb facs="P37_TL00035"/>is always at work to take in and delude the members of the guild. Of course they find it<lb facs="P37_TL00036"/>less easy to checkmate the initiated in their own devices. But if they have attained to the<lb facs="P37_TL00037"/>position of being necessary to their comrades in the trade, there is no sort of impropriety,<lb facs="P37_TL00038"/>pretence, injustice, swindling, tyranny, which they do not deem it lawful to employ. &amp;<lb facs="P37_TL00039"/>&amp; These arts, which the progress of our century has extended to many kinds of persons<lb facs="P37_TL00040"/>who are not of the profession, have a certain marked character among the tribe of actors.<lb facs="P37_TL00041"/>Other people, when detected, show some sense of shame and self-abasement. The unmasked<lb facs="P37_TL00042"/>comedian, after all his turns and twists have been employed in vain, is so unprejudiced and<lb facs="P37_TL00043"/>candid that he laughs good-humouredly in the face of his detective, and seems to exclaim<lb facs="P37_TL00044"/>with indescribable effrontary; " You are a great fool if you flatter yourself that you have<lb facs="P37_TL00045"/>made a notable discovery.<lb facs="P37_TL00046"/>Such is my experience. But of course it is possible that among the innumerable actors,<lb facs="P37_TL00047"/>male and female, whom I have known, conversed with, and studied, some phoenix of the<lb facs="P37_TL00048"/>one or the other sex may have escaped my observation.<lb facs="P37_TL00049"/>&amp; In what concerns the practise of their art, all that these people know is how to read and<lb facs="P37_TL00050"/>write; one better, and one worse.

It is the<lb facs="P40_TL00021"/>attitude of the over-righteous who says, 44 I can't come to your dance if Jones comes ;<lb facs="P40_TL00022"/>because why ? because, forsooth, Jones is different from me. How different ? Well,<lb facs="P40_TL00023"/>they do say, ! and then follows a list of Jones's enormities and indiscretions.<lb facs="P40_TL00024"/>Such methods are mean and wholly unreasonable; foolish, too, in matters of Art, for<lb facs="P40_TL00025"/>in that connection there is but one question of any value to be put in regard to a<lb facs="P40_TL00026"/>man : Is he a good workman ? does he act well ? paint well ? build well ? If yes, then he<lb facs="P40_TL00027"/>is the man we are looking for; if no, then find the man, but don't ask if he is a good<lb facs="P40_TL00028"/>man because no other man can act as judge in this matter; that must be left to the<lb facs="P40_TL00029"/>Creator of men.<lb facs="P40_TL00030"/>Riccoboni seems, however, to have been suffering from an exaggerated moral sense, and<lb facs="P40_TL00031"/>it was this which probably accounts, not only for the insertion of the second and fifth<lb facs="P40_TL00032"/>clauses in the contract, but for his attempt to reestablish the literary drama. His pious<lb facs="P40_TL00033"/>soul had doubtless been shocked and scandalised by the elder comedians, .....his parents<lb facs="P40_TL00034"/>in art, and their overflowing manners and jovial plays. Reaction perhaps produced<lb facs="P40_TL00035"/>in him, as usually in the case of sons of overflowing fathers, an eagerness to be correct;<lb facs="P40_TL00036"/>he could not better them on their own lines, therefore he would strike out in another<lb facs="P40_TL00037"/>direction and seek for that moral correctness of which they had been so joyously careless,<lb facs="P40_TL00038"/>and establish this correctness in the theatre by a careful choice of his fellow actors and<lb facs="P40_TL00039"/>through the restoration of those seemly literary plays which could be thoroughly censored<lb facs="P40_TL00040"/>before being set upon the stage.<lb facs="P40_TL00041"/>In regard to the administration of the business affairs of the Company all the actors<lb facs="P40_TL00042"/>without distinction, Riccoboni himself included, had equal shares, the funds being kept<lb facs="P40_TL00043"/>by one member and two others appointed to oversee the expenditure. Each one had to<lb facs="P40_TL00044"/>provide his own costumes with the exception of Fabio Sticotti, to whom they were furnished<lb facs="P40_TL00045"/>by the Company.<lb facs="P40_TL00046"/>In June 1733 Riccoboni, together with his wife and son, became a naturalised French<lb facs="P40_TL00047"/>subject and in April 1737 he obtained permission to absent himself for two months and go<lb facs="P40_TL00048"/>to act in England, while two years later leave was granted him to retire from [the stage<lb facs="P40_TL00049"/>with his wife and son with an annual pension of one thousand francs.

He who has not studied long and closely by<lb facs="P41_TL00029"/>rule comports himself, when he comes to act, either too stiffly or in too free-and-easy a<lb facs="P41_TL00030"/>manner. Doubtless there are some who say that on the stage one should imitate real<lb facs="P41_TL00031"/>life as closely as possible, and that whoever seeks or desires more than this is a fool.

He must have the fiery eye<lb facs="P42_TL00007"/>which menaces death, the bearing at once lofty and courteous, the voice which can both<lb facs="P42_TL00008"/>terrify and inspire, and how are such things to be found in one physically deformed ? <lb facs="P42_TL00009"/>&amp; And so is it in the playing of the lovers' parts. A sigh, a glance, a b0w,... these from<lb facs="P42_TL00010"/>one so handicapped may be not only unbecoming but positively absurd.<lb facs="P42_TL00011"/>No, the only possible way of escaping the limitations imposed by Nature lies in turning<lb facs="P42_TL00012"/>defects themselves to advantage by the choice of suitable parts, so that misfortune may<lb facs="P42_TL00013"/>itself be made a gain. A fraudulant king or one who falsely feigns himself a knight, such<lb facs="P42_TL00014"/>parts as these may yield excellent results when interpreted by one who is deformed since<lb facs="P42_TL00015"/>it Is ever amusing to see a misshapen person imitating beauty.... and this is advice not<lb facs="P42_TL00016"/>to be disdained. jg? <lb facs="P42_TL00017"/>On the other hand, the well-shaped actor is too apt to think that his physical gifts alone<lb facs="P42_TL00018"/>are enough to set him above his fellows, but it is useless to be handsome if stupidity lies<lb facs="P42_TL00019"/>beneath. The danger of the handsome actor lies in moving too much by rule and compass,<lb facs="P42_TL00020"/>calculating every step and acting stiffly as children do when they are set to recite some<lb facs="P42_TL00021"/>piece they have learned in school and make five or six set gestures to each word. &amp;<lb facs="P42_TL00022"/>Such an actor is too prodigal of gesture, but he should consult reason. What is it which<lb facs="P42_TL00023"/>prompts or controls him when he talks with various people in the house or street ? So<lb facs="P42_TL00024"/>convinced is the author of the importance of this frugality of gesture that he goes on to pray<lb facs="P42_TL00025"/>the Muse that each actor may feel as though lie were entirely deprived of arms and legs, and<lb facs="P42_TL00026"/>so, and so only, he wili be unembarassed and act well and his fame will go from east to west;<lb facs="P42_TL00027"/>and he continues praying that he himself, as actor, may understand the true and living<lb facs="P42_TL00028"/>sense of what he acts, for, he says, 44 I am the interpreter, I the priest ". He declares that<lb facs="P42_TL00029"/>in imagination he can hear them all inveighing against the 44 great reformer " who would<lb facs="P42_TL00030"/>thus mutilate the actor of his four principle limbs, leaving him, in moments of the fiercest<lb facs="P42_TL00031"/>passion, like a 44 boccale ; " (i.) but, let them say what they like ; if they can prove him to be<lb facs="P42_TL00032"/>wrong he will accept the correction gladly, but he still asserts that 44 the marking of every<lb facs="P42_TL00033"/>comma with a gesture is a trespass against truth " and that nothing is more annoying to<lb facs="P42_TL00034"/>the audience.<lb facs="P42_TL00035"/>The principal and necessary thing for the actor is, he asserts, to show clearly that he<lb facs="P42_TL00036"/>does not depart from the truth, for so he can almost convince his audience that what is<lb facs="P42_TL00037"/>feigned is not false, and unless he attains to this he will not please them. The actor, to<lb facs="P42_TL00038"/>give a natural effect, should forget not only his four limbs, but perhaps also the fifth, the<lb facs="P42_TL00039"/>head; but. he must feel what he acts,..;, love, anger, jealousy; feel like a king or like<lb facs="P42_TL00040"/>Beelzebub, and if he really feels all these emotions, if 44 with his heart he measures his<lb facs="P42_TL00041"/>movements" they will of themselves germinatq in him and move him to the right<lb facs="P42_TL00042"/>action.<lb facs="P42_TL00043"/>In the third Canto the actor is pictured as objecting that he can't feel like Beelzebub;<lb facs="P42_TL00044"/>like Achilles, for instance, he manage to feel, but not like Beelzebub ; no, that is<lb facs="P42_TL00045"/>a little too much to expect. The author admits that he has left the actor in a hard position<lb facs="P42_TL00046"/>at the end of the last canto, but that he does not really mean to send him to school to<lb facs="P42_TL00047"/>Hell. What he means is that when right feeling is master it imparts the right movements<lb facs="P42_TL00048"/>to the limbs. &amp;<lb facs="P42_TL00049"/>The actor must regard just proportion and not over-pass the truth. He certainly does not<lb facs="P42_TL00050"/>want to hear himself called a monkey, and the very characteristic of a monkey is that it<lb facs="P42_TL00051"/>imitates the reality of the living man but disfigures it by over-stepping truth. <lb facs="P42_TL00052"/>The actor should remember that Nature has its limits. He must also avoid extremes,<lb facs="P42_TL00053"/>bearing in mind that he has to please both the poor man and the prince. But in trying<lb facs="P42_TL00054"/>to be human he must be careful not to lower himself. If his imagination sweeps him out<lb facs="P42_TL00055"/>of the direct way let him ever keep the helm turned rather towards the higher extreme<lb facs="P42_TL00056"/>than the lower; And here the author, to emphasize his meaning, gives an example of the<lb facs="P42_TL00057"/>undignified behaviour of a king he once saw upon the stage.<lb facs="P42_TL00058"/>(1) A " boccale " la a kind of bottle.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P43_TL00002"/>This king had assembled before him his royal counsellors to examine and try a serious<lb facs="P43_TL00003"/>case. The accused was his own son, and, for the maintenance of the law, there was a<lb facs="P43_TL00004"/>universal murmur of 44 Death. ' The king, who was seated, rested his elbows on his knees<lb facs="P43_TL00005"/>and his chin between his hands, until, says Riccoboni, 44 he really seemed to me, in all<lb facs="P43_TL00006"/>good faith, one of those Pagodas that come from China, the only difference being that he<lb facs="P43_TL00007"/>was made of flesh and bone instead of clay. " Another example of the unbecoming behaviour<lb facs="P43_TL00008"/>of such petty kings was in a scene where a monarch, seated opposite his great lords and<lb facs="P43_TL00009"/>robed in kingly splendour, received a foreign ambassador and listened to the orator with<lb facs="P43_TL00010"/>his legs crossed and nibbling a glove. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P43_TL00011"/>Of course all the stupid immediately began to cry out, 44 how natural, how true to life!<lb facs="P43_TL00012"/>why, I did that myself! ", 44 and 1, more than once; " which could be well believed, since<lb facs="P43_TL00013"/>it was a gesture worthy of base persons, but certainly not of kings. True, a king might<lb facs="P43_TL00014"/>have made such gestures, but they should never have been offered as typical 44 kingly<lb facs="P43_TL00015"/>actions " on the stage.<lb facs="P43_TL00016"/>The actor must show nature, yes; but in an elevated and noble form, the trivial,<lb facs="P43_TL00017"/>(which may be becoming enough to the common people), being reserved for the streets or<lb facs="P43_TL00018"/>for the house. 44 In Comedy one smells at every flower, but Tragedy is a lady to be respected<lb facs="P43_TL00019"/>and full of majesty " and if the actor finds himself applauded for such actions as those<lb facs="P43_TL00020"/>cited above he must remember that it is false applause and that the glory bestowed by<lb facs="P43_TL00021"/>the base people is of little worth. In comedy it is permissable to show the low and trivial<lb facs="P43_TL00022"/>life of the city, but when a king is brought upon the stage, (although it may be that in<lb facs="P43_TL00023"/>real life there are kings who degrade themselves), he should be shown as noble and with<lb facs="P43_TL00024"/>all the dignity and beauty at command. &amp;<lb facs="P43_TL00025"/>The actor should be careful to make himself heard to the most distant spectator and<lb facs="P43_TL00026"/>also to make all his gestures visible, being heedful at the same time not to appear to those<lb facs="P43_TL00027"/>close at hand to be shouting and wildly gesticulating. As for other matters, those must be<lb facs="P43_TL00028"/>left to the actor's own good sense until he find the right way,<lb facs="P43_TL00029"/>In the fourth Canto facial expression is principally discussed. The author declares that<lb facs="P43_TL00030"/>interest is concentrated upon the actor's face. He cites examples from pictures wherein<lb facs="P43_TL00031"/>the impression caused by one central action is differently depicted upon each face in the<lb facs="P43_TL00032"/>group, and says that the actor must show feeling or he will not be believed to feel, and in<lb facs="P43_TL00033"/>that case all is lost. It is foolish to delude oneself with the idea that the audience note<lb facs="P43_TL00034"/>only gesture, form and voice. Why, it a line could be drawn from the eyes of every spectator<lb facs="P43_TL00035"/>to the point where his gaze fixes itself where would all the lines terminate and meet ? in<lb facs="P43_TL00036"/>the actor's face;<lb facs="P43_TL00037"/>&amp; This shews the value and importance of facial expression and the actor should practise<lb facs="P43_TL00038"/>this in front of a mirror. He should seek after the old mimic art, now unknown to us,<lb facs="P43_TL00039"/>remembering that those ancient mimes had only gestures and face by which to express<lb facs="P43_TL00040"/>everything, and yet the modern actor, with eyes, hands, ears and mouth at his command,<lb facs="P43_TL00041"/>seems often unable to express joy or sorrow or any emotion, giving, by his immobility, the<lb facs="P43_TL00042"/>impression that Nature sleeps in him.<lb facs="P43_TL00043"/>In weeping on the stage the actor must be careful not to disfigure his face and so<lb facs="P43_TL00044"/>make the people laugh or he will produce the opposite effect from that which he desires.<lb facs="P43_TL00045"/>A woman crying in a scene with her lover should, for instance, give the impression that<lb facs="P43_TL00046"/>her emotion is real to him, but should make it appear feigned to the audience, so that<lb facs="P43_TL00047"/>they may see 44 the deception joined with the truth and yet distinct ".

The screens were placed<lb facs="P60_TL00025"/>slantwise across the stage and were folded<lb facs="P60_TL00026"/>so as to suggest pillars. The lighting was<lb facs="P60_TL00027"/>from the top and the sides. One did not get,<lb facs="P60_TL00028"/>however, the sense of space which was<lb facs="P60_TL00029"/>intended by the artist. Possibly this is the<lb facs="P60_TL00030"/>fault of the construction of the theatre, the<lb facs="P60_TL00031"/>proscenium being so close to the auditorium,<lb facs="P60_TL00032"/>but it seemed to be in some measure due<lb facs="P60_TL00033"/>to the arrangement of the background. The<lb facs="P60_TL00034"/>lighting again was difficult to judge, partly<lb facs="P60_TL00035"/>because of the play, and partly because one<lb facs="P60_TL00036"/>was wandering in 44 worlds not realised. "<lb facs="P60_TL00037"/>If one may venture, in one's ignorance, to<lb facs="P60_TL00038"/>question, why was there so much amber<lb facs="P60_TL00039"/>and so little white light ?

BECAUSE, further, to add still more to the literary value of the book,<lb facs="P65_TL00030"/>the Translator has given an exhaustive Introduction, and been prodigal of<lb facs="P65_TL00031"/>notes elucidating names of those persons and places not generally known,<lb facs="P65_TL00032"/>and drawing attention to analogous stories in Boccaccio, Shakespeare, 44 The<lb facs="P65_TL00033"/>Arabian Nights," thus making the work useful to the scholar and student,<lb facs="P65_TL00034"/>as well as agreeable to the general public who read for the sake of pleasure<lb facs="P65_TL00035"/>and amusement.<lb facs="P65_TL00036"/>5. BECAUSE the price is for the moment absurdly low for two such noble<lb facs="P65_TL00037"/>volumes, whereof the value will increase in proportion as the books get scarcer,<lb facs="P65_TL00038"/>like stocks and shares that fluctuate according to the well-known law of<lb facs="P65_TL00039"/>supply and demand.<lb facs="P65_TL00040"/>6. BECAUSE only a small number of copies have been printed, and when<lb facs="P65_TL00041"/>these are sold out, or given away...the terms are nearly convertible in the<lb facs="P65_TL00042"/>present case...there will be no more obtainable, as we bind ourselves never<lb facs="P65_TL00043"/>to reprint the book, however great the demand.<lb facs="P65_TL00044"/>Detailed Prospectus and two specimen plates<lb facs="P65_TL00045"/>may he had for the Asking against sixpence<lb facs="P65_TL00046"/>to cover Cost of Postage.<lb facs="P65_TL00047"/>BRITISH BIBLIOPHLES ' SOCIETY.<lb facs="P65_TL00048"/>10 Rue de la Tribune, Brussels, Belgium</ab>

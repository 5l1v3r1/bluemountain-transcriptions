                                    <lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>sidered as seriously as the other arts, has been Craig's constant preoc«&gt;<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>cupation.

I hat they lie entwined among the roots of life<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>itself he has long since discovered. His aim, then, is clear. The Theatre<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>exists to interpret life.... use not in the accidental sense in which most<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>people conceive it, but that essense through which all things are made<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>manifest. <lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>Builder,sculptor,painter and musician have worked together to bring the<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>significance of life to bear upon the Church so that when the people wished<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>to commune with their Gods their presence has been felt and their voices<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>heard about them. That the atmosphere of the Theatre should be one and<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>the same and should serve a similar purpose not the purpose<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>of the preacher, is the object of Craig's labours. This is the end for which<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>he has worked and Is still striving; as a man, lost in tortuous caverns<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>suddenly sees far off a speck of light and knows then he will find his way<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>into the light of the sun, so he too is beginning to see a clear way out.</ab>

The whole spectacle is not a little farcical. &amp;<lb facs="P27_TL00005"/>Let us now look at the work of M. Bakst who, once an intelligent if<lb facs="P27_TL00006"/>successful painter, has become a scene and costume designer to the troupe<lb facs="P27_TL00007"/>and who shares the laurels with the dancers Nijinsky and Karsavina. 0<lb facs="P27_TL00008"/>OM. Bakst has a pretty knack of drawing coloured supplements and<lb facs="P27_TL00009"/>covers for the Illustrated papers. Although the designs are ugly they are<lb facs="P27_TL00010"/>only ugly enough to shock Parisians, (This has become a very easy feat<lb facs="P27_TL00011"/>of late years). The ugliness of Bakst's designs is not due to any stern<lb facs="P27_TL00012"/>qualities in his work; it is never terrible like Daumier, nor has it the<lb facs="P27_TL00013"/>irony of Beardsley's demon. Bakst is ugly on account of his clumsy sense<lb facs="P27_TL00014"/>of the sensual. All his women, (and he is never tired of putting them<lb facs="P27_TL00015"/>before the public,) are drugged and in a kind of sofa orgy. They seem to<lb facs="P27_TL00016"/>hate ecstacy and they adore a good wriggle.<lb facs="P27_TL00017"/>The costumes he puts them into are mute; they want to speak and<lb facs="P27_TL00018"/>cannot; they are the old refurbished wardrobe of the old Racinet and of<lb facs="P27_TL00019"/>Sarah Bernhardt, save that these two spoiled us often with stockings,<lb facs="P27_TL00020"/>underwear and sleeves, vests and pinafores.<lb facs="P27_TL00021"/>0 Bakst has a passion for beads, and his evidently sincere devotion to<lb facs="P27_TL00022"/>thick lips and flat noses enables him to indulge In a ring or two now and<lb facs="P27_TL00023"/>again. When he is at a loss how to get away from Racinet he fills In the<lb facs="P27_TL00024"/>gap, he covers his confusion, with a bead.<lb facs="P27_TL00025"/>0 The women he draws protrude ; therefore when he attempts to suggest<lb facs="P27_TL00026"/>something Indian or Chinese (and Russian Ballets are wedded to the<lb facs="P27_TL00027"/>East), he gets curiously confused. Indians and Chinese hate that which<lb facs="P27_TL00028"/>bulges. Bakst adores bulge ; ...it helps his beads so much. In short Bakst<lb facs="P27_TL00029"/>is vulgar. He is like a decorator of the French match boxes ; on seeing<lb facs="P27_TL00030"/>these maidens of the French match box one is reminded of Bakst.<lb facs="P27_TL00031"/>On paper his vulgarity beams with a kind of blue glow which is not<lb facs="P27_TL00032"/>without charm and he has fingers which can draw in delicate outlines<lb facs="P27_TL00033"/>his gross visions. 0 0 7<lb facs="P27_TL00034"/>0 On the stage Bakst is not vulgar, he is simply lost. &amp;<lb facs="P27_TL00035"/>0 His designs for "La Peri " and 44 Narclsse " are charming in the<lb facs="P27_TL00036"/>magazines ; in actuality they are nonexistent.

The feather worn in the hat and cap was<lb facs="P33_TL00020"/>often jewelled up the quill, and a large jewel or medallion usually covered<lb facs="P33_TL00021"/>the base of It.

The Theatre has a peculiar advantage towards elevating or degrading<lb facs="P56_TL00009"/>the tone of a nation. 1 think the Theatre always has aspired to a<lb facs="P56_TL00010"/>position among the fine arts.

I have<lb facs="P57_TL00034"/>/<lb facs="P57_TL00035"/>seen the work of the modern theatres in England, in Russia and in<lb facs="P57_TL00036"/>Germany and have studied it carefully.

                                    <lb facs="P58_TL00003"/>The standard In Germany and Russia for the scenic representation<lb facs="P58_TL00004"/>Is much higher than it was ten years ago. Both their realistic and<lb facs="P58_TL00005"/>poetic dramas have great care spent on them when in course of<lb facs="P58_TL00006"/>preparation when compared with the very same dramas as produced<lb facs="P58_TL00007"/>here in England. This Is to be greatly regretted.<lb facs="P58_TL00008"/>jSf Putting aside the scenic side of the question I should say that<lb facs="P58_TL00009"/>the standard for acting pure and simple is much higher in Italy<lb facs="P58_TL00010"/>than elsewhere. I regret that I have never visited Spain. &amp; &amp;<lb facs="P58_TL00011"/>2. In answer to your second question I would say that there are<lb facs="P58_TL00012"/>few managers who have added distinction to the stage since the<lb facs="P58_TL00013"/>days of Irving. Stanislawsky in Moscow has done so; Professor Max<lb facs="P58_TL00014"/>Reinhardt tries to do so, a very earnest German, Mr Herbert<lb facs="P58_TL00015"/>Trench tried to do 50,... and I believe Sir Herbert Tree would like to.<lb facs="P58_TL00016"/>3.4. &amp; You ask if Mr George Edwardes and Sir Herbert Tree have raised<lb facs="P58_TL00017"/>the stage in any way and if I can say in exactly what way. I cannot<lb facs="P58_TL00018"/>do so: but I feel that Sir Herbert Tree when a young man had<lb facs="P58_TL00019"/>an idealist's view of the stage. I remember well being struck by a<lb facs="P58_TL00020"/>photograph I saw of the celebrated actor-manager when he was<lb facs="P58_TL00021"/>quite a youth and thinking that he had the face of a man who would<lb facs="P58_TL00022"/>always be on the side of the angels. Irving had such a face to the<lb facs="P58_TL00023"/>end of his days.<lb facs="P58_TL00024"/>I believe Mr George Edwardes makes no pretentions to having raised<lb facs="P58_TL00025"/>the standard of the Theatre or its work, though I daresay he does<lb facs="P58_TL00026"/>raise it for I understand he is thorough in all that he takes up. Sir<lb facs="P58_TL00027"/>Herbert Tree, on the contrary, is, after a careful test, known to me<lb facs="P58_TL00028"/>as not thorough. I regret that I am obliged to make this statement<lb facs="P58_TL00029"/>but I have good proof now that what I state is unfortunately correct.<lb facs="P58_TL00030"/>As a rule I fear that the managers of the London Theatre are less<lb facs="P58_TL00031"/>thorough and more pretentious than is good for the stage. <lb facs="P58_TL00032"/>5* You ask me if I think the Theatre has ever aspired to a position<lb facs="P58_TL00033"/>among the Pine Arts and ever can aspire to such a position. I am<lb facs="P58_TL00034"/>only living so as to prove that. You tell me that the /Referee denies<lb facs="P58_TL00035"/>the Theatre that right. The Referee may go on denying until it<lb facs="P58_TL00036"/>becomes a quarterly journal and The Mask is a daily journal, but<lb facs="P58_TL00037"/>I think that will make no difference.</ab>

It Is the volume abstracted by Secretary<lb facs="P104_TL00007"/>tiarlan from Whitman's desk in the Interior Department and made the basis for<lb facs="P104_TL00008"/>Whitman's discharge from that branch of the service. An account of this incident,<lb facs="P104_TL00009"/>written by Whitman himsif, will be photographically reproduced and<lb facs="P104_TL00010"/>included. The edition will be limited to five hundred copies. The price fixed<lb facs="P104_TL00011"/>ten dollars for each copy.

In order to<lb facs="P104_TL00015"/>maintain a strict likeness to the original, in which Whitman used black ink and pen =<lb facs="P104_TL00016"/>cils of several colors, it will be necessary for each sheet to go through the press from<lb facs="P104_TL00017"/>three to five times. This is a costly process.<lb facs="P104_TL00018"/>The production of this work calls for the finest skill of the photographer, engraver<lb facs="P104_TL00019"/>and printer. But it will be faithfully supervised to the remotest particulars<lb facs="P104_TL00020"/>Each volume will be authenticated by a number and my signature.

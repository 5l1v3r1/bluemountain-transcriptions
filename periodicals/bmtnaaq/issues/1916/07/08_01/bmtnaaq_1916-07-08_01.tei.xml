                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00067"/>vice-chancellor of the order! Here was an opporunity<lb facs="P7_TL00068"/>exceeding my wildest dreams—to murder I could add<lb facs="P7_TL00069"/>insubordination and treachery. It was what my good<lb facs="P7_TL00070"/>mother would have called 'a special Providence.'<lb facs="P7_TL00071"/>"At about this time something occurred which caused<lb facs="P7_TL00072"/>my cup of joy, already full, to overflow on all sides, a<lb facs="P7_TL00073"/>circular cataract of bliss. Three men, strangers in that<lb facs="P7_TL00074"/>locality, were arrested for the stage robbery in which I<lb facs="P7_TL00075"/>had lost my money and watch. They were brought to<lb facs="P7_TL00076"/>trial and, despite my efforts to clear them and fasten<lb facs="P7_TL00077"/>the guilt upon three of the most respectable and worthy<lb facs="P7_TL00078"/>citizens of Ghost Rock, convicted on the clearest proof.<lb facs="P7_TL00079"/>The murder would now be as wanton and reasonless as<lb facs="P7_TL00080"/>I could wish.<lb facs="P7_TL00081"/>"One morning I shouldered my Winchester rifle and,<lb facs="P7_TL00082"/>going over to my uncle's house, near Nigger Head, asked<lb facs="P7_TL00083"/>my Aunt Mary, his wife, if he were at home, adding that<lb facs="P7_TL00084"/>I had come to kill him. My aunt replied with a peculiar<lb facs="P7_TL00085"/>smile that so many gentlemen called on the same errand<lb facs="P7_TL00086"/>and were afterward carried away without having per<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

She said I did not look as if I<lb facs="P7_TL00089"/>would kill anybody, so, as a guarantee of good faith, I<lb facs="P7_TL00090"/>leveled my rifle and wounded a Chinaman who happened<lb facs="P7_TL00091"/>to be passing the house. She said she knew whole families<lb facs="P7_TL00092"/>who could do a thing of that kind, but Bill Ridley was a<lb facs="P7_TL00093"/>horse of another color. She said, however, that I would<lb facs="P7_TL00094"/>find him over on the other side of the creek in the sheep<lb facs="P7_TL00095"/>lot; and she added that she hoped the best man would<lb facs="P7_TL00096"/>win.<lb facs="P7_TL00097"/>"My Aunt Mary was one of the most fair-minded<lb facs="P7_TL00098"/>women whom I have ever met.<lb facs="P7_TL00099"/>"I found my uncle down on his knees engaged in skin<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Seeing that he had neither gun nor pistol<lb facs="P7_TL00101"/>handy, I had not the heart to shoot him, so I approached<lb facs="P7_TL00102"/>him, greeted him pleasantly, and struck him a powerful<lb facs="P7_TL00103"/>blow on the head with the butt of my rifle. I have a<lb facs="P7_TL00104"/>very good delivery, and Uncle William lay down on his<lb facs="P7_TL00105"/>side, then rolled over on his back, spread out his fingers,<lb facs="P7_TL00106"/>and shivered. Before he could recover the use of his<lb facs="P7_TL00107"/>limbs I seized the knife that he had been using and cut his<lb facs="P7_TL00108"/>ham-strings. You know, doubtless, that when you sever<lb facs="P7_TL00109"/>the tendon Achillis the patient has no further use of<lb facs="P7_TL00110"/>his leg; it is just the same as if he had no leg. Well, I<lb facs="P7_TL00111"/>parted them both, and when he revived he was at my<lb facs="P7_TL00112"/>service. As soon as he comprehended the situation, he<lb facs="P7_TL00113"/>said:<lb facs="P7_TL00114"/>" 'Samuel, you have got the drop on me, and can afford<lb facs="P7_TL00115"/>to be liberal about this thing. I have only one thing to<lb facs="P7_TL00116"/>ask of you, and that is that you carry me to the house<lb facs="P7_TL00117"/>and finish me in the bosom of my family.'</ab>

I sound the knocker on her door. The<lb facs="P8_TL00080"/>old maid opens and smiles and lets me enter. I go into<lb facs="P8_TL00081"/>the living room.

It merely<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>coins new names for old things, the need for these new<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>mames arising from various old things being developed,<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>and assuming a new conspicuousness. For example, the<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>steam-engine and the aeroplane are driven by forces which<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>are eternal; but the modern prominence of these forces,<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>the momentous use to which they have been put, have<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>inevitably resulted in an elaborate nomenclature growing<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>dp around them, and the like happens constantly where<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>art is concerned. Thus the school of Claude Monet, who<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>styled themselves Impressionists, and were regarded by<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>most of their contemporaries as a complete novelty, were<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>simply concerned with exploiting certain perennial laws<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>in colour-harmony; and analogous exploiting had been<lb facs="P16_TL00038"/>"essayed long before it had received the definite name of<lb facs="P16_TL00039"/>Impressionism, an outstanding anticipator of this method<lb facs="P16_TL00040"/>of painting being Delacroix. In the same way, in the<lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>middle of the last century, Britain was signally wanting<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>in any taste for the applied arts; and presently Ruskin and<lb facs="P16_TL00043"/>William Morris began striving eloquently to inculcate<lb facs="P16_TL00044"/>■that taste, which thereupon acquired the name of<lb facs="P16_TL00045"/>: a word previously little in vogue, this thing<lb facs="P16_TL00046"/>to which it referred being very old withal. For, of course,<lb facs="P16_TL00047"/>during hundreds of years prior to the advent of machinery,<lb facs="P16_TL00048"/>a love of the applied arts was widely in evidence, the<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>Georgian era being one wherein it was specially salient,<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>nor does it appear ever to have been thought silly in those<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>•days.

The delightful journal of Delacroix is rich<lb facs="P16_TL00089"/>in matter of this sort, as also is the autobiography of<lb facs="P16_TL00090"/>Goethe; while others like Dominique Ingres, Leonardo da<lb facs="P16_TL00091"/>Vinci and G.

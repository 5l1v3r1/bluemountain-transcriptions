But there was that<lb facs="P7_TL00070"/>sadness always prevailing: "How happy could we be if<lb facs="P7_TL00071"/>we had money, at least enough to have a home of our own<lb facs="P7_TL00072"/>wherein to bring up our children and live our lives."<lb facs="P7_TL00073"/>Sadness was reflected in the big eyes of the little orphan<lb facs="P7_TL00074"/>whom Mr. Allan "a rich, respectable merchant" later<lb facs="P7_TL00075"/>adopted.<lb facs="P7_TL00076"/>Mr. Allan took the "poor child" who had been denied<lb facs="P7_TL00077"/>the blessings "of a respectable, Christian home" to his<lb facs="P7_TL00078"/>mansion. But the fact that his adopted son was an actor's<lb facs="P7_TL00079"/>child was well advertised among those associating with<lb facs="P7_TL00080"/>the Allan household. His schoolmates and play friends<lb facs="P7_TL00081"/>looked upon him as a foundling picked up on the streets<lb facs="P7_TL00082"/>by the goodness of a respectable citizen. His teachers,<lb facs="P7_TL00083"/>who otherwise would have paid attention to his originality,<lb facs="P7_TL00084"/>saw in it only the arising "evil spirit." And again he<lb facs="P7_TL00085"/>was isolated.<lb facs="P7_TL00086"/>Wasn't there once an hour of awakening when the boy<lb facs="P7_TL00087"/>thought they might be right after all.

He will travel<lb facs="P12_TL00010"/>in the company of my own private secretary, he will start<lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>out in New York, go to Japan, to India, across the Red<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>Sea to Europe, stay awhile on the Riviera, go to Italy,<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>France, Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, and return,<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>after visiting Asia, Egypt and South Africa, to New York.<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>If he wishes to go to Australia he is welcome to do so<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>and to tour the country for three months. The trip will<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>last three years; I will grant him one year's stay in New<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>York in order to prepare himself properly to study foreign<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>languages. Coal miners, not younger than thirty years,<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>can enter this competition. The conditions are as follows:<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>"First:—He has to be a coal miner for at least ten<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>years.<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>"Second must be intelligent, he must have a keen<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>gift of observation and be very vivacious.<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>"Third:—He must agree to work ten more years after<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>his return in one of my coal mines.<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>"As judges in this competition, there will be six inde<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

AZY.<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>About six thousand men applied for the trip. Two<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>hundred and forty were chosen and their names placed<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>upon the ballot. There was no graft whatever connected<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>with the election and Francis Rooth of New Orleans, a<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>man of about thirty-two years of age, was the lucky one.<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>Rooth was a single man and he looked rather old for<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>his age, but one doesn't work in a coal mine for thirteen<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>years without showing signs of hard work. His bearded<lb facs="P12_TL00043"/>face was serious and skinny. His eyes were sad-looking<lb facs="P12_TL00044"/>and his tall figure was slightly bent over. As a young<lb facs="P12_TL00045"/>man, he had written poems to a young girl. He had<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>enclosed them in his application, but he himself had lost<lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>the sense of beauty he had expressed in the poems of his<lb facs="P12_TL00048"/>youth. Anyhow, he had sent in his application more as a<lb facs="P12_TL00049"/>joke following his quick impulse. He never expected an<lb facs="P12_TL00050"/>answer. One nice morning, they called him into the<lb facs="P12_TL00051"/>offices of the mine and told him that he, Francis Rooth,<lb facs="P12_TL00052"/>would enjoy the three years trip around the world.<lb facs="P12_TL00053"/>And at first he didn't feel even happy. He heard the<lb facs="P12_TL00054"/>words but he couldn't quite believe them.<lb facs="P12_TL00055"/>"You don't even smile?" asked the superintendent.<lb facs="P12_TL00056"/>"Oh yes, I do," replied Francis, and he did his best to<lb facs="P12_TL00057"/>grin in a friendly way.<lb facs="P12_TL00058"/>The superintendent again read to him all conditions of<lb facs="P12_TL00059"/>the agreement, and then he asked him to sign it. <lb facs="P12_TL00060"/>"There is one thing of importance," he said.

He studied<lb facs="P12_TL00073"/>the art of being well dressed, and how to associate with<lb facs="P12_TL00074"/>women. He received piano lessons. His mentor took him<lb facs="P12_TL00075"/>to the opera and to theatres. He became an expert in<lb facs="P12_TL00076"/>sailing, rowing, driving and motoring. He lived in a<lb facs="P12_TL00077"/>little house on the sea-shore and his daily companion was<lb facs="P12_TL00078"/>a young artist who drew his attention to the beauties of j<lb facs="P12_TL00079"/>the sea, to the wonders of the setting sun and to the<lb facs="P12_TL00080"/>miracles of Spring and Winter.

                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00104"/>vered and worshipped by millions. His friend, the artist,<lb facs="P12_TL00105"/>had letters of introduction to the nicest and kindest people<lb facs="P12_TL00106"/>on earth. He met the big poets of Europe, he met the<lb facs="P12_TL00107"/>greatest among the living and he met women with bad<lb facs="P12_TL00108"/>reputations. He was the guest in palaces and in castles<lb facs="P12_TL00109"/>and he visited the poor in their dungeon holes. His<lb facs="P12_TL00110"/>most wonderful day he lived in Java, but of that, we<lb facs="P12_TL00111"/>can speak another time.<lb facs="P12_TL00112"/>On the 15th of October, 1928, he landed in New York<lb facs="P12_TL00113"/>and everything seemed to him like the beautiful dream of<lb facs="P12_TL00114"/>one night. He wished to call upon Mr. K. R. Azy, but<lb facs="P12_TL00115"/>his friend, the painter, said: "You had better wait; he<lb facs="P12_TL00116"/>will send you an invitation." On the 19th of October, (<lb facs="P12_TL00117"/>he arrived in New Orleans. He went to his old home, i<lb facs="P12_TL00118"/>and he was shocked by its smallness, darkness and its<lb facs="P12_TL00119"/>poverty.

And the eleven hours<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>passed. After working hours, Francis Rooth kept to<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>himself. He didn't feel like talking, and they called him<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>"haughty." He spoke to nobody.<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>On the third day, they called him into the offices of<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>the company. Mr. K. R. Azy awaited him in his richly<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>appointed private office.<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>"Do ypu want to change your clothes?" he was asked.<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>"No." "So much the better." Mr. K. R. Azy wished<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>to see him anyhow in the attire of a mine worker. Only<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>a little souvenir for his benefactor, Francis Rooth wished<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>to bring over from his home. He could do that in a<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>minute.<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>He saw his benefactor for the first time.<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>A lazy, pale, greasy man was seated almost lying in a<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>big upholstered arm-chair. His puffed-up face seemed<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>drowsy. His fat hand indicated a slow movement as a<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>greeting.<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>"Take a seat, Mr. Rooth, and tell me how you feel?"<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>"Thank you, I prefer to stand up.

Where shall I start?"<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>The spongy face smiled lazily; "Oh no, please don't,<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>you shall tell me how you feel now."<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>Francis Rooth had suspected that the multi-millionaire<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>would not ask for the adventures of his trip around the<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>world. Therefore he had put into his pocket the little<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>souvenir. But just to be sure, he asked again; "Shall I<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>tell you about India ... or about the nights in<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>Norway ... or about our tiger huntingTn India?"<lb facs="P13_TL00045"/>The pale fat face smiled still more lazily and the hideous<lb facs="P13_TL00046"/>massive greasy hand pointed down to the floor: "No. no,<lb facs="P13_TL00047"/>my dear man, leave alone those things. How are you<lb facs="P13_TL00048"/>feeling right now, down there in that coal mine where you<lb facs="P13_TL00049"/>are going to spend the next ten years of your life?"<lb facs="P13_TL00050"/>It was very quiet in the private offices of his benefactor.<lb facs="P13_TL00051"/>Francis Rooth put his hand into the pocket where he<lb facs="P13_TL00052"/>had placed his souvenir, out came quick as lightning a<lb facs="P13_TL00053"/>gun and he shot down his benefactor, Mr. Charles K.

"You are a six spot, a<lb facs="P17_TL00067"/>white chip. You give me de hunch of my life." And so<lb facs="P17_TL00068"/>it came about that young Bill Nimmack, the only son<lb facs="P17_TL00069"/>of the leading hay-feed merchant of Waterburg, roomed<lb facs="P17_TL00070"/>and boarded with Florida May in one of the swellest<lb facs="P17_TL00071"/>hotels in the Catskills.

He felt quite proud of his<lb facs="P17_TL00079"/>mission. And she bubbled over with good spirits.

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00004"/>THERE was once a poet, who did not win any laurels<lb facs="P8_TL00005"/>and who never was advertised in magazines and<lb facs="P8_TL00006"/>book stores. At length he thought of committing suicide.<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>"Then," he said, "I shall be famous forever." So he<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>arranged all his unsold manuscript in a neat pile and went<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>into a public park on the evening of a great national<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>holiday. "Now is the time and this is the place!" he<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>cried, and where the crowd was thickest he shot himself<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>and died. But he had come so far away from his friends<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>that there was no one in all the vast multitude who knew<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>him. He was buried in Potter's Field, unidentified;<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>and was soon quite forgotten, even by his creditors, but<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>his manuscripts were found by the well-known compiler<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>of a literary review. He read them with great interest,<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>adopted a few of them for his own works and published<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>the balance anonymously under the title "Poems as found<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>in a Furnished Room." Literary reviewers wondered who<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>the author of this novel and beautiful little volume might<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>be. In years to come the compiler of literature who had<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>been unofficially identified as the author of the anonymous<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>book had himself forgotten whether he had really written<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>those poems or simply compiled them.<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>At the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>New York Crimes Book Review he blushingly admitted<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>his authorship.<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>The dead poet is slumbering peacefully away with<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>thousands of other unknown wayfarers on the road to<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>Fame and Success which they did not achieve in reaching.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>oughfare lived Martin Hupp and his mother. They lived<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>on the ground floor of a little two-storied house of red<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>brick, which had been painted over and over again. On<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>the inside it looked like it had been half-scrubbed away.<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>There were depressions in the floors where bristles and<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>soap had left their mark. Even the furniture looked<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>colorless and grooved from too diligent cleaning. But of<lb facs="P16_TL00038"/>late the dust had begun to settle, and the smoke from the<lb facs="P16_TL00039"/>trains was awful, since there was no one to keep it down<lb facs="P16_TL00040"/>like the old woman used to.<lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>The old woman was going off her head, and getting<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>weaker and nobody seemed to know what was the matter<lb facs="P16_TL00043"/>with her at all. But Martin thought it was just old age,<lb facs="P16_TL00044"/>because she had always been like that, only now she was<lb facs="P16_TL00045"/>worse. He had to begin doing the work and cooking<lb facs="P16_TL00046"/>supper after he got home. She sat in her old chair and<lb facs="P16_TL00047"/>grumbled at him. She said he was as worthless as his<lb facs="P16_TL00048"/>father had been before he died. "You couldn't use your<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>hands—none of you—and surely it wasn't from me you<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>got shiftless ways." Martin paid no attention to what<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>she said, except sometimes to tell her to shut up; he was<lb facs="P16_TL00052"/>keeping her and maybe they would do better by her at the<lb facs="P16_TL00053"/>home for old folks. She said, "Mighty poor keeping."<lb facs="P16_TL00054"/>When his father was living he always saw him make<lb facs="P16_TL00055"/>her stop nagging by slapping her. One time when his<lb facs="P16_TL00056"/>father was in a towering rage, he gave her a sound kiss,<lb facs="P16_TL00057"/>which was ridiculous to Martin, because they were both<lb facs="P16_TL00058"/>so old. But she did not seem to like it, because she held<lb facs="P16_TL00059"/>her tongue for two days. He guessed she had always<lb facs="P16_TL00060"/>been bitter and wrinkled. He would have had to laugh<lb facs="P16_TL00061"/>right out if anybody said she ever was pretty, or looked</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00062"/>like girls looked. Because, when he first knew them, both<lb facs="P16_TL00063"/>his father and mother were old. He learned by their<lb facs="P16_TL00064"/>talk that he had a brother and a sister. They went away<lb facs="P16_TL00065"/>some time when he was little and the old people never<lb facs="P16_TL00066"/>answered whether it was for good or bad. They argued<lb facs="P16_TL00067"/>about them a lot, but they never seemed to have a good<lb facs="P16_TL00068"/>word for them. When Martin did anything the old<lb facs="P16_TL00069"/>woman did not like, her tongue was a whip. "Your pa<lb facs="P16_TL00070"/>was just like you. His friends all got up in the world,<lb facs="P16_TL00071"/>but he sat still and dirtied the floor with his pipe. He<lb facs="P16_TL00072"/>burnt a hole in my wedding dress. Don't you ever let me<lb facs="P16_TL00073"/>see you bein' proud of yourself, Martin Hupp." Mr.<lb facs="P16_TL00074"/>Hupp once wrote a poem called "Billy McCann."<lb facs="P16_TL00075"/>On the day of Mr. Hupp's funeral she took Martin<lb facs="P16_TL00076"/>home and told him all his father's faults. He thought<lb facs="P16_TL00077"/>it sounded like she was reading from the Scriptures. It<lb facs="P16_TL00078"/>was a joke, too, because—what good did it do? At the<lb facs="P16_TL00079"/>end she told him he inherited them all, and what's more,<lb facs="P16_TL00080"/>they would never leave him. She said: "You'd just as<lb facs="P16_TL00081"/>well kill yourself as even look at a whiskey bottle." She<lb facs="P16_TL00082"/>said not one of her children had red hair, as she had,<lb facs="P16_TL00083"/>which was proof enough for her. It had always been a<lb facs="P16_TL00084"/>sign in her family that only the red-heads turned out<lb facs="P16_TL00085"/>right. Martin was satisfied God meant people to be<lb facs="P16_TL00086"/>bitter like his mother and not to like anything. Even<lb facs="P16_TL00087"/>when people worked hard she grumbled, too. He told<lb facs="P16_TL00088"/>her, what if he did work, she jumped him anyhow—and<lb facs="P16_TL00089"/>his hands scarred from the cutting when he came home<lb facs="P16_TL00090"/>late every night to do housework.<lb facs="P16_TL00091"/>She said Johnny Mcßride was making more money than<lb facs="P16_TL00092"/>he—the Bentz woman told her. "The Bentz woman<lb facs="P16_TL00093"/>is a liar, because I caught her in more than one," he<lb facs="P16_TL00094"/>answered. He thought he had reason for hating Johnnj-<lb facs="P16_TL00095"/>Mcßride, as he always did. He knew if he stayed there<lb facs="P16_TL00096"/>talking to her like that any longer he would be sorry he<lb facs="P16_TL00097"/>had not left her sooner, so he went to bed. He wanted<lb facs="P16_TL00098"/>to slam the door as 'he went out, but his hand brought it<lb facs="P16_TL00099"/>to silently. He held his feet in both hands in bed and<lb facs="P16_TL00100"/>wondered where to get the money for her funeral.<lb facs="P16_TL00101"/>In his work he had all day to run a knife on leather<lb facs="P16_TL00102"/>sheets, cutting out parts that, later, were sewed into the<lb facs="P16_TL00103"/>body of the shoe. The knife was sharp and it was tempta<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00104"/>tion to work fast. He could hardly remember a day he<lb facs="P16_TL00105"/>did not get a fresh mark on his hand where the knife went<lb facs="P16_TL00106"/>wrong. Martin was the clumsiest cutter in the factor}*<lb facs="P16_TL00107"/>He knew, because everybody seemed to try to keep from<lb facs="P16_TL00108"/>talking to him about it. His mother said it was too skill<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00109"/>ful a kind of work for a Hupp. He sometimes stopped his<lb facs="P16_TL00110"/>ears so as not to hear what she said, but when he heard<lb facs="P16_TL00111"/>her he always had to believe her. After she scolded him<lb facs="P16_TL00112"/>he always worked harder. The company said they would<lb facs="P16_TL00113"/>give a prize to whoever did the best work for some special<lb facs="P16_TL00114"/>shoes. Everybody did their best and held their breath<lb facs="P16_TL00115"/>until they found out who won. One day a man came<lb facs="P16_TL00116"/>in and said Martin won. They were all so surprised they<lb facs="P16_TL00117"/>did not even ask to look what he got. He put it in his<lb facs="P16_TL00118"/>pocket right away. It was a red-colored medal with a<lb facs="P16_TL00119"/>shoe on one side. He was afraid to show it to his mother.<lb facs="P16_TL00120"/>But at last he threw it on the table as though he did not<lb facs="P16_TL00121"/>care about it and told her how he got it. She only<lb facs="P16_TL00122"/>laughed at it. "Now, you'll be getting the big head and<lb facs="P16_TL00123"/>doing things worse and worse. It's better to be makin'<lb facs="P16_TL00124"/>things like that. Nobody was ever any good that ever</ab>

Everything was clean and tied up<lb facs="P17_TL00006"/>all over the house. He asked his mother if she had been<lb facs="P17_TL00007"/>moving around some,<lb facs="P17_TL00008"/>"I ain't been out of this chair, and you didn't even<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>bring me a newspaper, though Lord knows there's nuthin'<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>in 'em," she said. "You're thinkin' about the house<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>cleanin'; if you wouldn't be hidin' your thoughts and<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>would ever tell the truth. You're a suspicious one. Well,<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>it wasn't me that done it, as you might see if you looked<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>at that pile of dust over there, which I've been seein'<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>right under my nose all day long, and at the bed pulled<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>out that ain't been half pushed back. You're a smart<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>one puttin' that skinny Mcßride girl up to comin' in her<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>and doin' my work."<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>Martin did not say anything then. The Mcßride<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>girl spoke to him so sharply, he wondered why she hated<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>him. But he felt like going right out of the house to find<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>her. He told his mother, after he thought, that he was<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>glad the Mcßride girl knew something. She said: "You<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>needn't go on about it, boy. If any more strangers come<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>around my house actin' like they don't have work of their<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>own to do, I know how to make 'em feel they're not<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>wanted. Charity is for folks that ask for it, and when<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>other people do your work look out for trouble. I'm<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>not hankerin' for more than I've got and you'll have to<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>be sendin' her away." She stopped and looked at Martin<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>so hard he thought she was getting ready to jump up at<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>him. "Martin, the most wicked thing you could do<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>would be marryin" she said.<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>He ate everything in sight that she left, and ran down<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>the street. The back door of the Mcßride house was<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>closed and the kitchen was dark. Somebody struck a<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>match. In a few minutes Jean came to the door'and said,<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>"Oh, Martin Hupp." He pulled his cap off his tousled<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>hair. "Are you drunk?" she said. "I mean because<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>father is, and you never came to see me before." Martin<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>asked her to go to the picture show. "I don't like them,<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>you know," she said. "All the other girls do and I don't<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>see why you asked me instead of them." She held out a<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>handful of her pale, yellow hair, laughing. "I've just<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>washed it; smell it. It smells like soap. It'll look awful.<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>Shall we go to the one that's just opened?"<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>She told Martin to wait outside. He thought he was<lb facs="P17_TL00048"/>afraid of her—she talked just like his mother, about any<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00049"/>thing that came into her head. Anyway, if she said<lb facs="P17_TL00050"/>anything again about not wanting to go with him—he<lb facs="P17_TL00051"/>would just walk away from her. He thanked her first<lb facs="P17_TL00052"/>for helping his mother, as soon as she came back. He<lb facs="P17_TL00053"/>thought she acted ashamed. Everybody called her ugly,<lb facs="P17_TL00054"/>and he guessed, after all, she was, though he could not<lb facs="P17_TL00055"/>help looking at her.<lb facs="P17_TL00056"/>After he thanked her, they were both silent, and then<lb facs="P17_TL00057"/>Jean laughed. ."She hates me awful," she said. "You<lb facs="P17_TL00058"/>can't tell me she's your mother, because I never thought<lb facs="P17_TL00059"/>you looked like her at all. I never do things when I<lb facs="P17_TL00060"/>have to ,do you? Unless somebody makes me. I did it<lb facs="P17_TL00061"/>because I just saw it made your mother mad. Mamma<lb facs="P17_TL00062"/>makes me sew, and I don't mind, because I put things<lb facs="P17_TL00063"/>together wrong. I can't help. She has to do it all over<lb facs="P17_TL00064"/>again."</ab>

In<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>order to be well informed on the progress of the several<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>conflicts now going on we cannot devote much time to a<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>study of the battles of a bygone day. And we are so<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>accustomed to hearing about the slaughter of men by the<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>tens of thousands that a battle in which a few hundred<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>men are killed is given scant attention.<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>But forty years ago all the world was interested in the<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>campaign of the United States troops against the Sioux<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>Indians of the Northwest, and General G. A. Custer was<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>a national hero.<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>On the 25th day-of June, 1876, the Seventh Cavalry<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>under command of Custer, met the Sioux Indians under<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>Gall, Crazy Horse, Inkpaduta, Black Moon and Sitting<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>Bull. The Indian camp was found upon the west side<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>of the Little Big Horn River and was reached by Custer's<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>command at about nine o'clock in the morning. Custer<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>sent Major Reno with three troops to attack it from<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>the south, and Captain Benteen with three troops to<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>prevent the Indians from retreating to the west, and<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>Captain McDougal with one troop was left to guard the<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>pack train, while Custer, with five troops, moved to the<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>north, down the river, to attack the camp at the upper<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>end.<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>Every school boy in the land knows what happened.<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>Reno was forced to retreat to the east side of the river<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>where he entrenched his troops on the top of a hill. He<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>was joined here by Benteen and McDougal, while Custer<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>and his men were wiped out to the last man.<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>While this fight may seem quite insignificant when<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>compared with our modern battles, the men who fought<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>and died there were every bit as brave as the heroes of<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>to-day.<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>And so, in commemoration of the event, the fortieth<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>anniversary of the fight was celebrated in a fitting manner<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>on the battle field beside the picturesque Little Big Horn<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>River in Montana.

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00050"/>tions of the Custer Fight. Hours and hours, that have<lb facs="P18_TL00051"/>lengthened into many a long day have been spent by<lb facs="P18_TL00052"/>students of Indian warfare in telling just how it came<lb facs="P18_TL00053"/>about. The men who were in the country then, the<lb facs="P18_TL00054"/>soldiers, scouts and trappers, each has had his own version<lb facs="P18_TL00055"/>of the affair to tell, and nearly all of them have written<lb facs="P18_TL00056"/>books about it. There has been many an argument brought<lb facs="P18_TL00057"/>up by these survivors, and many a question asked that<lb facs="P18_TL00058"/>has remained unanswered, until one can hardly blame<lb facs="P18_TL00059"/>some people who refuse to believe what they hear or half<lb facs="P18_TL00060"/>they see.<lb facs="P18_TL00061"/>I suppose that the aevarge reader of this article will<lb facs="P18_TL00062"/>not believe that I have written the original copy on a<lb facs="P18_TL00063"/>field desk that was used by General Custer. The very<lb facs="P18_TL00064"/>desk where he penned such glowing accounts of his travels<lb facs="P18_TL00065"/>through the wild and untamed west. lam sure that many<lb facs="P18_TL00066"/>of the old timers will say that it is not his desk, but I<lb facs="P18_TL00067"/>will continue to believe it is until presented with mighty<lb facs="P18_TL00068"/>strong evidence to the contrary.<lb facs="P18_TL00069"/>We have positive proof that Curly, the Crow scout, was<lb facs="P18_TL00070"/>the-only man with Custer's command who got out alive.<lb facs="P18_TL00071"/>But from time to time we see newspaper accounts of the<lb facs="P18_TL00072"/>discoverer of "the only survivor of the fight." These<lb facs="P18_TL00073"/>"survivors" have amounted to quite a number, and if<lb facs="P18_TL00074"/>they could all be brought together, they would constitute<lb facs="P18_TL00075"/>a body of men far in excess of the number who actually<lb facs="P18_TL00076"/>were with Custer. Taking their word for it, we find that<lb facs="P18_TL00077"/>not a man was killed excepting the general, and we may<lb facs="P18_TL00078"/>find him bobbing up in some unexpected corner in the<lb facs="P18_TL00079"/>vicinity of one of our insane asylums, perhaps.<lb facs="P18_TL00080"/>Did Custer really wear long hair?

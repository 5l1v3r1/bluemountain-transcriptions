The old fellow<lb facs="P8_TL00061"/>fumbled for the change, and while he was doing so, said:<lb facs="P8_TL00062"/>"Look through." Rather reluctantly the young man did<lb facs="P8_TL00063"/>so. He would have preferred first to have his change safe<lb facs="P8_TL00064"/>in hand.<lb facs="P8_TL00065"/>There was quite a large star visible. It looked like our<lb facs="P8_TL00066"/>moon but seemed slightly lopsided. He was pondering<lb facs="P8_TL00067"/>whether the old fellow would return to him ten cents or<lb facs="P8_TL00068"/>fifteen. Meanwhile the proprietor of the telescope was<lb facs="P8_TL00069"/>explaining that the star was the planet Jupiter; and the<lb facs="P8_TL00070"/>young man began to perceive that it was not lopsided,<lb facs="P8_TL00071"/>those were the smoky bands that he saw, and there were<lb facs="P8_TL00072"/>the attendant moons—four of them!<lb facs="P8_TL00073"/>At first he was overcome with a feeling of awe, then<lb facs="P8_TL00074"/>he was frightened. It was as though he stood on tiptoe<lb facs="P8_TL00075"/>at the edge of the world and might, at any minute, fall<lb facs="P8_TL00076"/>off and get lost in that shimmery blueness. But, after a<lb facs="P8_TL00077"/>steady gaze, he got his balance. He no longer felt uneasy.<lb facs="P8_TL00078"/>He had left this little globe with its two for a nickel<lb facs="P8_TL00079"/>people and was wandering through the heavens! Then<lb facs="P8_TL00080"/>suddenly, but very quietly and seriously, but confidently,<lb facs="P8_TL00081"/>he looked into the eyes of the Great I Am. He saw into<lb facs="P8_TL00082"/>the illimitable. Time and Space fell from him like a<lb facs="P8_TL00083"/>shrouding garment. He grasped at and for a moment<lb facs="P8_TL00084"/>held, the Infinite.<lb facs="P8_TL00085"/>Then he looked away.<lb facs="P8_TL00086"/>He had two coins thrust into his hand.

When he had gone<lb facs="P8_TL00088"/>two blocks he began fearfully to wonder what was the<lb facs="P8_TL00089"/>value of those coins. "But, perhaps/' he thought, "the<lb facs="P8_TL00090"/>old man was a magician or something and gave me two<lb facs="P8_TL00091"/>pieces of gold." He took the money out and by the light<lb facs="P8_TL00092"/>of the street lamp saw that it was, fifteen cents—but good<lb facs="P8_TL00093"/>money!<lb facs="P8_TL00094"/>The night was chill.

He only smiled. Their boy<lb facs="P8_TL00098"/>was asleep. The man looked at him for a moment and<lb facs="P8_TL00099"/>fondly realized that he would soon be walking. Then a<lb facs="P8_TL00100"/>feeling almost of panic came upon him and he cried to<lb facs="P8_TL00101"/>himself: "I must earn more money." . . ,<lb facs="P8_TL00102"/>To-day he did better work than for weeks past and to<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

She said it was the<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>easiest thing to be a villager from the very first day, if<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>one only comes properly prepared. And so I bought a<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>pink and white striped skirt, a green smock with red and<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>black trimmings, a white tarn o' shanter, big walking shoes<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>without heels, in quite a manly fashion. Once in New<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>York, I boarded a bus at the Penn. station, which bore<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>the inscription of the Dorado of my destiny: "Washing<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Virginia had written<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>"You must have cigarettes right from the start. Carry<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>them in a little case in the pocket of your smock." Well,<lb facs="P14_TL00051"/>I set out to hunt for rooms. Next to the famous Garret<lb facs="P14_TL00052"/>of Bruno, whose door was locked and labelled with the<lb facs="P14_TL00053"/>inscription: "If your knock is not answered, please go<lb facs="P14_TL00054"/>away, as I don't want you."—l was not wanted—are<lb facs="P14_TL00055"/>several houses with 'Jto rent" signs on the door. I rang<lb facs="P14_TL00056"/>a bell at one of these houses and a Frenchwoman opened<lb facs="P14_TL00057"/>the door. She looked me over carefully, scrutinized my<lb facs="P14_TL00058"/>satchel and asked not very invitingly: "Do you paint or<lb facs="P14_TL00059"/>write?" I was tickled to think that this person should<lb facs="P14_TL00060"/>think me an artist at first glance and I admitted—really<lb facs="P14_TL00061"/>I blushed—that I was a newspaperwoman. "What paper<lb facs="P14_TL00062"/>are you with?" was the next query. I wanted to see her<lb facs="P14_TL00063"/>studios and I indicated in a rather stern voice that I had</ab>

The price was not very high<lb facs="P14_TL00067"/>and I paid one month in advance. She left me alone in<lb facs="P14_TL00068"/>my new home. I have a hugh fireplace filled with old<lb facs="P14_TL00069"/>ashes and cigarette stumps.

She also told me to enquire for Jack MacGrath<lb facs="P14_TL00075"/>who is the official introducer and "make-yourself-at-home"<lb facs="P14_TL00076"/>man in the Village.<lb facs="P14_TL00077"/>"If you can get him friendly towards you," she said,<lb facs="P14_TL00078"/>"you will know everybody in less than a week.

She told me everything<lb facs="P14_TL00084"/>about everybody in the Village and she described them so<lb facs="P14_TL00085"/>vividly that I was sure I should be able to pick them out<lb facs="P14_TL00086"/>in a crowd.<lb facs="P14_TL00087"/>I fixed my hair in a fashion that could have passed for<lb facs="P14_TL00088"/>"bobbed" and I went out to have dinner at Polly's. I<lb facs="P14_TL00089"/>found an old building next to a church surrounded by<lb facs="P14_TL00090"/>Italian grocery stores and tenement houses.<lb facs="P14_TL00091"/>In the backyard of the house, under a tent, were tables<lb facs="P14_TL00092"/>and chairs and a lot of people talking, laughing and eating.<lb facs="P14_TL00093"/>Nobody paid any attention to me.

                                    <lb facs="P14_TL00094"/>barrassed. Finally I decided to take a chair at a table<lb facs="P14_TL00095"/>where a couple of girls and three men were seated. They<lb facs="P14_TL00096"/>evidently knew each other very well. They did not speak.<lb facs="P14_TL00097"/>One of the girls had red hair and red cheeks and they<lb facs="P14_TL00098"/>called her "Billy." One of the men wore a blue shirt<lb facs="P14_TL00099"/>with turnover collar and had long hair. He was anxious<lb facs="P14_TL00100"/>to get food and called at short intervals, with a very deep<lb facs="P14_TL00101"/>voice: "Mike, I say Mike!" Then Billy asked for a glass<lb facs="P14_TL00102"/>of water, drank it in one draught and the scene repeated<lb facs="P14_TL00103"/>itself. I was handed, by a nice girl who could not have<lb facs="P14_TL00104"/>been Polly—because Polly has bobbed hair and this girl<lb facs="P14_TL00105"/>had not—a yellow pad and pencil, to write down my name<lb facs="P14_TL00106"/>and order.<lb facs="P14_TL00107"/>Billy wanted another glass of water. Mike just arrived<lb facs="P14_TL00108"/>with some food for the hungry poet with long hair. I was<lb facs="P14_TL00109"/>sure he was a poet. My order came and I soon finished,<lb facs="P14_TL00110"/>paid and went out. I was very much disappointed. I had<lb facs="P14_TL00111"/>thought that Polly's was a sort of all-world meeting place<lb facs="P14_TL00112"/>where one could talk with another quite informally and<lb facs="P14_TL00113"/>now I had eaten a solitary dinner all by myself and had<lb facs="P14_TL00114"/>nothing else to do but to walk home. I had missed my<lb facs="P14_TL00115"/>only chance to make some acquaintances. I strolled<lb facs="P14_TL00116"/>through the park. The rain had ceased some time ago and<lb facs="P14_TL00117"/>a lot of children had come out, playing noisily. The<lb facs="P14_TL00118"/>benches were filled with men and women who evidently<lb facs="P14_TL00119"/>had no other place to sit in.<lb facs="P14_TL00120"/>Later in the Night<lb facs="P14_TL00121"/>I cannot sleep. I went to bed quite early. But this<lb facs="P14_TL00122"/>constant noise of the buses and my new surroundings<lb facs="P14_TL00123"/>drives me out of bed. I think it novel that I should talk<lb facs="P14_TL00124"/>to you, little book, because I have no one else, not even,<lb facs="P14_TL00125"/>a book to read. My trunk with my travelling library has<lb facs="P14_TL00126"/>not arrived I am in Greenwich Village. What will it</ab>

"I'd<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>rather walk," she said, standing on tiptoe and poking her<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>chin out to him, "let's just walk." He felt as he did when<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>he saw something good to eat lying on a table, and could<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>just take it and nobody would know. As they walked<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>along she took his arm and said: "Can I have the dime<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>you were going to buy the tickets with?" He said, "Sure,"<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>and handed it to her. She took it and said, "Thanks,"<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>and then said, "Now you'll never say 'sure' in that mean<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>way again, because I won't stand it. I'm not like the<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>rest of my family."<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>They came to a bakery box sitting against the wall on<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>the sidewalk, and she asked him to sit down with her.<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>Martin saw the same things she did, but he would have<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>thought he was a fool if he talked about them so much.<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>"I like to watch people and a girl can't at night when<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>it's better, because the men are with them," she said. "I<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>hate to see women alone." She picked up his hand and<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>said it scratched her, it was so rough. He felt like he<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>ought to hold her's until after she wanted to let go, but<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>he was afraid to. "You ought to get rich, Martin, she<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>said, "but none of my family will. Maybe I'll marry<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>riches."<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>They were beginning to feel the cold and presently she<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>said, "Let's go home, because I want to tell you some-</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>thing." As they passed the picture show again, she stopped<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>and looked square at him and told him: "I didn't want to<lb facs="P18_TL00046"/>go in there, but I wanted to go out. The druggist didn't<lb facs="P18_TL00047"/>give me the ice cream; I bought it and asked you for the<lb facs="P18_TL00048"/>dime, because a gentleman should always treat a lady.<lb facs="P18_TL00049"/>So now, if you're mad, you can go home to your old<lb facs="P18_TL00050"/>mother; she's sulky enough." Martin wanted to hit her,<lb facs="P18_TL00051"/>but the next instant she grabbed hold of his arm and<lb facs="P18_TL00052"/>pinched it and was saying for him not to be a fool like so<lb facs="P18_TL00053"/>many boys were. She added, "I couldn't tell you about<lb facs="P18_TL00054"/>the ice cream unless I was walking. I always have to<lb facs="P18_TL00055"/>walk when there's something on my soul."<lb facs="P18_TL00056"/>She told him she was eighteen and would never work<lb facs="P18_TL00057"/>in a factory after her father died, and she hated the drug<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00058"/>gist because he once told her she was pretty, and everybody<lb facs="P18_TL00059"/>knew he was a liar. She said she loved to get up early<lb facs="P18_TL00060"/>in the morning and dress, and that she loved to dress, all<lb facs="P18_TL00061"/>except shoes, and that some day she would never wear<lb facs="P18_TL00062"/>shoes again—she would just forget them. Martin thought<lb facs="P18_TL00063"/>it was funny she had not been born a boy, and that it<lb facs="P18_TL00064"/>would be nice to have money, because she might look<lb facs="P18_TL00065"/>better in a new dress. When he asked to come to see her,<lb facs="P18_TL00066"/>she said sometimes she cried and he had better bring a<lb facs="P18_TL00067"/>bucket along.<lb facs="P18_TL00068"/>She did Mrs. Hupp's work all the time after that. The<lb facs="P18_TL00069"/>old woman went on about it, but Martin never said any<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00070"/>thing to her at all. It was a great comfort to have things<lb facs="P18_TL00071"/>pretty and clean and find supper on the fire when he came<lb facs="P18_TL00072"/>in. He always used to hold the door open a little too<lb facs="P18_TL00073"/>long, no matter how cold it was, because he was a fresh<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00074"/>air crank. Sometimes he would see the girl and his mother<lb facs="P18_TL00075"/>together. He thought Jean was like lightning, she was so<lb facs="P18_TL00076"/>quick about doing things. When she aad his mother spoke<lb facs="P18_TL00077"/>to each other they almost always seemed mad. Jean would<lb facs="P18_TL00078"/>stop in the middle of her work while they looked hard<lb facs="P18_TL00079"/>into each other's eyes, as though it were a trial of strength.<lb facs="P18_TL00080"/>But sometimes she just went on like she had not heard<lb facs="P18_TL00081"/>Mrs. Hupp speak. And the old woman followed the girl<lb facs="P18_TL00082"/>around with her sharp glances, which never seemed to miss<lb facs="P18_TL00083"/>looking at everything.</ab>

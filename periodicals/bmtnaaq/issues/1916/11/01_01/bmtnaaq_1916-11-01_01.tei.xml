He accepts the<lb facs="P3_TL00047"/>praise as his due and meets his adversaries with contempt.<lb facs="P3_TL00048"/>He believes in himself; his self-reliance is unlimited. "He is."<lb facs="P3_TL00049"/>says his English publisher, W. M. Rosetti, "above all else the<lb facs="P3_TL00050"/>one man who has earnest convictions and confesses that now<lb facs="P3_TL00051"/>as in the future, he will be the founder of a new poetical<lb facs="P3_TL00052"/>literature, a great literature suitable to the material grandeur<lb facs="P3_TL00053"/>and incalculable destinies of America." He believes that the<lb facs="P3_TL00054"/>future will consider him as much the maker of America as it<lb facs="P3_TL00055"/>will Columbus as the discoverer of the Western continent, or<lb facs="P3_TL00056"/>Washington as the founder of the States. A sublime conviction<lb facs="P3_TL00057"/>indeed, expressed more than once by the poet in magnificent<lb facs="P3_TL00058"/>words, none more splendid than those beginning the poem:<lb facs="P3_TL00059"/>Come, I will make the continent indissoluble,<lb facs="P3_TL00060"/>I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shown upon,<lb facs="P3_TL00061"/>I will make divine, magnetic lands,<lb facs="P3_TL00062"/>With the love of comrades,<lb facs="P3_TL00063"/>With the lifelong love of comrades.<lb facs="P3_TL00064"/>This has a proud ring.

If you will take a walk<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>up to the Newberry Park, in front of the Newberry Library,<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>you can well imagine yourself on Washington Square.

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>houses, a few queer eating-places, a little bit of vice, the<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>University as a background here as well as in Newberry Park,<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>some tragedy and some romance—and there you are. But the<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>people here—you surely couldn't duplicate them anywhere.<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>And such bunches of them—just one like another, just as if<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>they had been made after the same pattern. And still they<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>think that they are "so different." Everyone of them did<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>something some time ago, and spend the balance of their lives<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>in telling each other what they did, and seem to study ways<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>and means to get in some way or another an appreciation for<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>it.

Yet it<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>is the same spring that every season pervades the whole earth<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>with meditative sweetness. The cares of winter are forgotten,<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>as with a thin vague haze, murmuring of the green world<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>outside, it envelopes all objects in the languor of a dream.<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>Suddenly she heard a merry laugh. Se looked about. There<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>over the fence opposite, appeared a little fellow with a shock of<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>blonde hair, and peered curiously into the yard: "Say lady,<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>give me some flowers. I want to make some bee jam for the<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>baby." The sun played upon its head and shining from the<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>rear made happiness that she had hoped for, had never entered<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>her life, waved her hand in greeting, and threw a cluster over<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>to him with a cheerful "Here you are." The boy seriously<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>nodded, "Thank you, lady," and disappeared from view.<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>The scene had suddenly changed from her, everything had<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>lost its color. The garden seemed to lie in shadow, as it were,<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>although the sun poured upon it as before. An immense lone<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>liness possessed her. The line between her thin but well cut<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>lips grew straight. What could it be that affected her so?<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>She had often felt the emptiness in her life—that her woman<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>hood was not complete—but she had never felt it so keenly<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>before. The great happiness that she had hoped for, had<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>never entered her life. The room that had been her nursery<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>stood empty. Would it ever ring with childish prattle and<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>laughter? Would she ever hold a new life to her breast?<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>What else but that deep hope had inflamed kisses upon her lips.<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>She was destined to pine away like an unopened but*.<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>Was it her fault, was it her husband's?

She knew<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>that there were some who did not wish for any, something she<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>could not understand. And, yet as she went over the list of<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>her married acquaintances they were nearly all childless. The<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>New Englanders were played out as a race, a large percentage<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>were no longer capable of fatherhood and motherhood, her<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>husband had told her. Just like these wisteria, coming from a<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>foreign land with their vitality exhausted so that their seeds<lb facs="P8_TL00045"/>are useless. How often had she tried to replant a few branches<lb facs="P8_TL00046"/>along the trellised walk but c*«spite the tender care bestowed<lb facs="P8_TL00047"/>upon them they would not grow. There had never been a<lb facs="P8_TL00048"/>change for their existence. In summers past, the present stems<lb facs="P8_TL00049"/>had yielded all they could give. And what remote causes,<lb facs="P8_TL00050"/>operating from time immemorial through series of generations,<lb facs="P8_TL00051"/>had condemned her to the same insufficiency. Was the sap of<lb facs="P8_TL00052"/>life also extinguished in her family?<lb facs="P8_TL00053"/>She had remembered that she had read somewhere that<lb facs="P8_TL00054"/>Chinese women in quaint flowered gowns would sing litanies<lb facs="P8_TL00055"/>to the goddess of fecundity. Uh! that the same pagan angel<lb facs="P8_TL00056"/>of annunciation would enter her quiet home. And by a sudden<lb facs="P8_TL00057"/>wild impulse she plucked a big bunch of wisteria and called<lb facs="P8_TL00058"/>out to the boy, "Do you want some more flowers?" The boy's<lb facs="P8_TL00059"/>head appeared once more, smiling and nodding with a curious<lb facs="P8_TL00060"/>mien. In feverish haste she hurried back and forth from the<lb facs="P8_TL00061"/>porch to the fence, with her arms full of blossoms and the little<lb facs="P8_TL00062"/>fellow clapped his hands in glee.<lb facs="P8_TL00063"/>Then she looked with a half happy, yet painful smile at the<lb facs="P8_TL00064"/>demolished flower wall, a silent symbol of her beautiful but<lb facs="P8_TL00065"/>empty revolt. She had sacrificed her favorite flowers for a<lb facs="P8_TL00066"/>flower that may never bloom in her life.</ab>

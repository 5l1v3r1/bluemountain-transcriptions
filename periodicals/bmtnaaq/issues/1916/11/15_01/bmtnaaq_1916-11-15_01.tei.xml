How hard it is for one who can work to<lb facs="P4_TL00006"/>accept alms. No matter what you call it, this money given us<lb facs="P4_TL00007"/>under all sorts of names is alms.<lb facs="P4_TL00008"/>Twenty marks. . . .! It itches in my fingers. It seems<lb facs="P4_TL00009"/>so very much money if one is accustomed to carry only a few<lb facs="P4_TL00010"/>pennies in one's pocketbook. If only I did not have to pay out<lb facs="P4_TL00011"/>most of it! I do need some coal and wood. I have frozen<lb facs="P4_TL00012"/>bitterly in my cold room during the past weeks. To go to the<lb facs="P4_TL00013"/>cafe and sit in its warmth and read papers will be impossible<lb facs="P4_TL00014"/>for me for quite awhile.<lb facs="P4_TL00015"/>For the thirty pfennigs I would have to leave there I can<lb facs="P4_TL00016"/>buy myself a supper. One always needs so much in order to<lb facs="P4_TL00017"/>sustain life. And what sort of life is this? That one does<lb facs="P4_TL00018"/>not starve is the only pleasant feature.

Especially on<lb facs="P4_TL00021"/>days like today, with the sun shining again and warm outside,<lb facs="P4_TL00022"/>one feels it more than ever.<lb facs="P4_TL00023"/>Nov. 23, 1915.<lb facs="P4_TL00024"/>One would like to recall every hour spent in previous times<lb facs="P4_TL00025"/>merrily and in spending money: travelling in society, at the<lb facs="P4_TL00026"/>bar, or drinking wine with girls. Yes. . . . girls! They<lb facs="P4_TL00027"/>have become wholly uninteresting; love has become a mere<lb facs="P4_TL00028"/>play. The world now is rough and does not bother about the<lb facs="P4_TL00029"/>smaller things. And what should we do with girls? We can't<lb facs="P4_TL00030"/>give them anything any more and so they have become untrue<lb facs="P4_TL00031"/>to us. We are the superfluous people. At present they are<lb facs="P4_TL00032"/>crazy over our field-gray soldiers.<lb facs="P4_TL00033"/>I stood today in front of a candy shop. I have never liked<lb facs="P4_TL00034"/>sweetmeats very much. But today I did not seem to be able<lb facs="P4_TL00035"/>to tear myself away from that shop window. I studied the<lb facs="P4_TL00036"/>prices as if I expected to be a salesman in the shop. There<lb facs="P4_TL00037"/>were chocolate bars for five pfennig apiece. I viewed them<lb facs="P4_TL00038"/>for a long time. Finally I left the place. I have to be very<lb facs="P4_TL00039"/>saving. Two rolls, war bread, mean more to me than one<lb facs="P4_TL00040"/>chocolate bar. The bread has to remain dry. I haven't seen<lb facs="P4_TL00041"/>butter for months. And one has been accustomed to a better<lb facs="P4_TL00042"/>life. Life without sweets is hard even if one does not starve<lb facs="P4_TL00043"/>but remains steadily upon the verge of starvation.<lb facs="P4_TL00044"/>I have never been a heavy eater but now the stomach is first<lb facs="P4_TL00045"/>consideration.

Our stomachs are at work, we learn to enjoy what we<lb facs="P4_TL00048"/>took for granted only a year ago. We have become simple<lb facs="P4_TL00049"/>Milk is a luxury. Bread, dry bread, something delicious.<lb facs="P4_TL00050"/>Sausages, which we never would have thought of eating, taste<lb facs="P4_TL00051"/>delightful to us.

The<lb facs="P4_TL00056"/>chocolate bars were irresistible. I was weak. I did not even<lb facs="P4_TL00057"/>try to resist. I bought one. . . . Just one, but it was so<lb facs="P4_TL00058"/>little, so very little for a supper. Two war rolls are more.<lb facs="P4_TL00059"/>I went to bed hungry.<lb facs="P4_TL00060"/>I am very often hungry now. It is something I never have<lb facs="P4_TL00061"/>known in previous years. I always used to leave something<lb facs="P4_TL00062"/>over on my plate. Now my plates are clean. I hardly need<lb facs="P4_TL00063"/>to wash them. Of course I have to do all my own work.

Maybe this is the reason for my having so little to put<lb facs="P4_TL00067"/>on the plates. My tea contains water so plentifully that even<lb facs="P4_TL00068"/>seven cups would not hurt the weakest heart.<lb facs="P4_TL00069"/>It seems to me that I really never experienced a real winter.<lb facs="P4_TL00070"/>Freezingâ€”hunger.

On this very same spot Agnes, his former<lb facs="P6_TL00116"/>chambermaid, had caught up with him a week ago as he was<lb facs="P6_TL00117"/>returning from a walk, had accosted him violently and her<lb facs="P6_TL00118"/>parting words still rung in his ear:<lb facs="P6_TL00119"/>"You just wait!â€”l will show you what it means to seduce<lb facs="P6_TL00120"/>innocent girls! I will throw the child before your door. . . .<lb facs="P6_TL00121"/>I will go into the courts. . . . I'll tell your wife all about<lb facs="P6_TL00122"/>it. . . ." and then she had demanded that he deposit to her<lb facs="P6_TL00123"/>name in the bank five thousand rubles. Migujew thought of<lb facs="P6_TL00124"/>all this again, sighed deeply and was sincerly sorry that he<lb facs="P6_TL00125"/>had permitted the weakness of a moment to burden him with<lb facs="P6_TL00126"/>such worries.<lb facs="P6_TL00127"/>After he had reached his house, Migujew seated himself on<lb facs="P6_TL00128"/>the porch and rested. It was ten o'clock and the moon peeped<lb facs="P6_TL00129"/>bashfully through the heavy clouds that covered the heavens.<lb facs="P6_TL00130"/>The street and the alleys round the houses were deserted. The<lb facs="P6_TL00131"/>older generation of inhabitants were about to retire and the<lb facs="P6_TL00132"/>young people had walked out to the woods. Migujew fumbled<lb facs="P6_TL00133"/>in his pockets for matches to light a cigarette and his elbow hit<lb facs="P6_TL00134"/>against something soft; uninterestedly he looked in its direction<lb facs="P6_TL00135"/>and suddenly he was seized by a fright as if he had discovered<lb facs="P6_TL00136"/>a snake at his feet. On the porch, propped up against the<lb facs="P6_TL00137"/>door, lay a bundle. Something oblong seemed to be wrapped<lb facs="P6_TL00138"/>up in a coverlet of some sort. The one end of the bundle was<lb facs="P6_TL00139"/>open and the lieutenant felt something warm and damp as he<lb facs="P6_TL00140"/>touched it with his hand. Awestricken he rose and looked<lb facs="P6_TL00141"/>around like a prisoner who anticipates escaping his guards.<lb facs="P6_TL00142"/>"She has done it then!" he murmured through his teeth, and<lb facs="P6_TL00143"/>clenched his fists angrily. "Here it lies. . . . here lies the sin!<lb facs="P6_TL00144"/>Oh, God in Heaven!"<lb facs="P6_TL00145"/>Fright, anger and shame made him rigid. . . . What was he<lb facs="P6_TL00146"/>to do now? What would his wife say when she learned the<lb facs="P6_TL00147"/>truth? And what his fellow officers? His Excellency surely<lb facs="P6_TL00148"/>would pat his shoulders, burst out into laughter and say: "I<lb facs="P6_TL00149"/>congratulate. . . .

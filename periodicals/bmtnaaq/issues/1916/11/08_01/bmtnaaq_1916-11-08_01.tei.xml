                                    <lb facs="P2_TL00006"/>"J*HE old frame house on the corner of Washington Square South and of Thompson Street, which was known as Bruno's<lb facs="P2_TL00007"/>Garret, shows no more the big black signs inviting you in white letters to drop in and to see an exhibition of works of<lb facs="P2_TL00008"/>some artist or other, or to stop in and listen to some poet read his own poetry.<lb facs="P2_TL00009"/>The Garret was closed on November Ist.<lb facs="P2_TL00010"/>I am not a friend of prospectuses and of announcements. Two years ago I conceived the idea of having a place where<lb facs="P2_TL00011"/>I could publish a magazine whose pages would be open to everybody who has something to say, whose walls would welcome<lb facs="P2_TL00012"/>the paintings and drawings any artist would choose to bring to it; a place where poets could come and read their poetry to<lb facs="P2_TL00013"/>an audience that had strolled in accidentally as had they themselves. I did not send out prospectuses and announcements.<lb facs="P2_TL00014"/>But I opened my doors and sent out my invitations and whoever wanted to come came. The Garret became known, at first<lb facs="P2_TL00015"/>in New York and later all over the United States, and it made friends in England, and Germany, in Austria and France,<lb facs="P2_TL00016"/>in Italy. The Slavic countries sent their friendly messages and even China and Japan were represented by artists and by<lb facs="P2_TL00017"/>poets. The war brought over many refugees, artists and writers who came to Bruno's Garret before they went out to make<lb facs="P2_TL00018"/>the rounds of art galleries and magazine editors in the city.<lb facs="P2_TL00019"/>I could fill pages with reminiscences and memories vibrating with the sentiment of obsequies. I could write a book of<lb facs="P2_TL00020"/>melancholic sadness in verse libre while leaving these rooms that have become so dear to me. I could picture to you, dear<lb facs="P2_TL00021"/>reader, in tear-wet words how badly I feel at abandoning the place where I have worked two of the best years of my life.<lb facs="P2_TL00022"/>In turn you would feel sad and you would send me a few thoughts of sympathy.<lb facs="P2_TL00023"/>But I don't do all this because lam always and always on my way. I have no time to sit beside the road reviewing<lb facs="P2_TL00024"/>memories. My past can never pass into my future. My present is the big wall that prevents memories of the past from<lb facs="P2_TL00025"/>mingling with the dreams of the future.<lb facs="P2_TL00026"/>I love deeds and no matter if well done or badly done, verily they are better than words.<lb facs="P2_TL00027"/>And so I say, the Garret has fulfilled its mission. Here has been the debut of men and women who have made their<lb facs="P2_TL00028"/>mark in art and letters since. The Garret has earned its place in the history of contemporary art and letters. It will live in<lb facs="P2_TL00029"/>the memory of those who used to gather there. The literature that bears its imprint is the testimony of its spirit.<lb facs="P2_TL00030"/>Everything I undertook there was done upon its own merit. I never asked for anything without giving value for value.<lb facs="P2_TL00031"/>I opened up the Garret and I closed it.<lb facs="P2_TL00032"/>Per aspera ad astra.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>this happened long ago. She was younger and nicer in<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>those days. Nikolai Petrowitch Kolpakow, her admirer,<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>was visiting her in her country home. It was unbearably hot<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>and humid. Kalpakow had finished his noonday meal, and had<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>drunk a whole bottle of bad port wine; he did not feel very<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>well and was in a bad mood. Both were bored, waiting for<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>the cooler evening to take a walk.<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>Suddenly the doorbell rang. Kolpakow was in his shirt<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>sleeves. He jumped up from his seat and looked questioningly<lb facs="P7_TL00046"/>at Pasha.<lb facs="P7_TL00047"/>"Maybe it is the letter carrier, or perhaps a girl friend,"<lb facs="P7_TL00048"/>said the actress.<lb facs="P7_TL00049"/>Kolpakow didn't mind in the least Pasha's girl friends nor<lb facs="P7_TL00050"/>the letter carrier. But to be sure he picked up his coat and<lb facs="P7_TL00051"/>went into the next room while Pasha went out to open the<lb facs="P7_TL00052"/>door.<lb facs="P7_TL00053"/>To her great surprise it was not the letter carrier, nor one<lb facs="P7_TL00054"/>of her friends, but a young and beautiful lady, handsomely<lb facs="P7_TL00055"/>dressed in a refined style; she looked like a "good" woman.<lb facs="P7_TL00056"/>The stranger was pale and breathing heavily as if she had<lb facs="P7_TL00057"/>ascended several flights of stairs.<lb facs="P7_TL00058"/>"What is it you wish?" asked Pasha.<lb facs="P7_TL00059"/>The lady did not answer immediately.

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00061"/>peared to be in pain. It was some time before she had com<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00062"/>posed herself and was able to speak. She took a seat.<lb facs="P7_TL00063"/>"Is my husband here?" she asked finally, raising her eyes<lb facs="P7_TL00064"/>which were red from crying.<lb facs="P7_TL00065"/>"Whose husband?" asked Pasha, and she became suddenly<lb facs="P7_TL00066"/>so frightened that her hands and feet grew cold. "Whose<lb facs="P7_TL00067"/>husband?" she repeated, trembling with emotion.<lb facs="P7_TL00068"/>"My husband, Nikolai Petrowitch Kolpakow."<lb facs="P7_TL00069"/>"No, . . . madam . . . I . . I never knew a husband."<lb facs="P7_TL00070"/>A few minutes of silence lapsed. The lady repeatedly wiped<lb facs="P7_TL00071"/>her eyes with a lace handkerchief. Pasha had not dared to<lb facs="P7_TL00072"/>sit down. She looked at her visitor frightened and helplessly.<lb facs="P7_TL00073"/>"You maintain then that he is not here?" asked the lady with<lb facs="P7_TL00074"/>a firm voice and a curious smile.<lb facs="P7_TL00075"/>"I ... I do not know whom you mean."<lb facs="P7_TL00076"/>"You vulgar low woman . . ~" murmured the lady, looking<lb facs="P7_TL00077"/>with hatred and contempt at Pasha. "Yes, yes . . . you are a<lb facs="P7_TL00078"/>vulgar woman and I am happy, very happy that I have finally<lb facs="P7_TL00079"/>a chance to tell you so face to face!"</ab>

"But it does<lb facs="P7_TL00090"/>not matter whether he is here or not. I simply want to tell<lb facs="P7_TL00091"/>you that embezzlements have been discovered and that they are<lb facs="P7_TL00092"/>looking for Nikolai Petrowitch. They are going to arrest him.<lb facs="P7_TL00093"/>And that is your work!"<lb facs="P7_TL00094"/>The lady arose and paced the room in great excitement.<lb facs="P7_TL00095"/>Pasha looked at her in astonishment. She could not grasp<lb facs="P7_TL00096"/>what all this meant.<lb facs="P7_TL00097"/>"Today he will be found and arrested," said the lady, crying<lb facs="P7_TL00098"/>and sobbing.

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00100"/>tempt she felt for Pasha. It looked as if she would spit in her<lb facs="P7_TL00101"/>face the next moment. "I am powerless . . .

The lady walked up and<lb facs="P7_TL00108"/>down while Pasha stared at her; she could not understand and<lb facs="P7_TL00109"/>expected momently that something dreadful would happen.<lb facs="P7_TL00110"/>"I know nothing of all this, madam," she said, and com<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

I have<lb facs="P7_TL00113"/>known you for a long while. I know that there has not been<lb facs="P7_TL00114"/>a day during the last four months that he did not spend with<lb facs="P7_TL00115"/>you!"<lb facs="P7_TL00116"/>"Yes? And what of it?

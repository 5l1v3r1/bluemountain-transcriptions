It was the work of a historian, the honored<lb facs="P3_TL00085"/>Palacky, a statesman and leader of his nation, to bring back<lb facs="P3_TL00086"/>to memory the national importance of Bohemia. It was shortly<lb facs="P3_TL00087"/>after the year 1848 that he proved not only to his own people<lb facs="P3_TL00088"/>but to the entire world that Bohemia had a language, a highly<lb facs="P3_TL00089"/>cultivated language; that Bohemia had a literature, and a right<lb facs="P3_TL00090"/>to national liberty and independence.<lb facs="P3_TL00091"/>In those days it was considered a political crime to confess<lb facs="P3_TL00092"/>to Bohemian nationality, to speak Bohemian in public places or<lb facs="P3_TL00093"/>on the street, A system of police surveillance was strictly kept<lb facs="P3_TL00094"/>up by the imperial Government in Vienna; and to be known as<lb facs="P3_TL00095"/>a Bohemian sympathizer meant social and often financial ruin.<lb facs="P3_TL00096"/>And even to-day are the electoral laws such that 3,000,000<lb facs="P3_TL00097"/>Germans are enabled to elect fifty-three Deputies to Parliament,<lb facs="P3_TL00098"/>while 5,000,000 Bohemians can elect only fifty.

The<lb facs="P4_TL00112"/>result met their most optimistic expectations. At the end of<lb facs="P4_TL00113"/>each term, the Son came home more and more Respectable,<lb facs="P4_TL00114"/>more and more Snobbish and more and more contemptuous of<lb facs="P4_TL00115"/>everybody who wasn't in his set or whose ancestors had not<lb facs="P4_TL00116"/>dwelt in"the land of the Awlrites the same length of time as<lb facs="P4_TL00117"/>his own.<lb facs="P4_TL00118"/>The Very Respectable Couple were delighted and so, when<lb facs="P4_TL00119"/>the time came? to consider the education of Daughter in order<lb facs="P4_TL00120"/>that she too might become Very Respectable, they spoke to each<lb facs="P4_TL00121"/>other after the following fashion: If a college education has<lb facs="P4_TL00122"/>had such a satisfactory effect upon our Son, why wouldn't it be<lb facs="P4_TL00123"/>equall) advantageous for our Daughter?" that it<lb facs="P4_TL00124"/>would, they immediately set to work to find the snobbiest col<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Consequently they turn out<lb facs="P4_TL00146"/>a conventional product. Colleges for women, on the other hand,<lb facs="P4_TL00147"/>are the relatively new and unconventional thing which of<lb facs="P4_TL00148"/>course makes their product unconventional.

"How<lb facs="P4_TL00152"/>stupid of us not to have thought of that. We must go and pick<lb facs="P4_TL00153"/>out a good Finishing School at once."<lb facs="P4_TL00154"/>"Alas, it is too late," declared the Soothsayer.

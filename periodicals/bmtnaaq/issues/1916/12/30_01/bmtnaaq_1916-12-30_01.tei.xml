This is perhaps fortunate,<lb facs="P3_TL00048"/>since they are generally kept locked; and even when they are<lb facs="P3_TL00049"/>open, they are jealously guarded in the spirit of that Westminster<lb facs="P3_TL00050"/>Abbey verger who, not long ago, had a stranger arrested for<lb facs="P3_TL00051"/>kneeling down, and explained, when remonstrated with, that if<lb facs="P3_TL00052"/>that sort of thing were tolerated, they would soon have people<lb facs="P3_TL00053"/>praying all over the place. Happily, it is not so everywhere.<lb facs="P3_TL00054"/>You may now ride or tramp into a village with a fair chance of<lb facs="P3_TL00055"/>finding the church-door open and a manuscript placard in the<lb facs="P3_TL00056"/>porch, whereby the parson, speaking no less as a man and a<lb facs="P3_TL00057"/>brother than as a porter of the House Beautiful gives you to<lb facs="P3_TL00058"/>understand that the church is open always for those who have<lb facs="P3_TL00059"/>any use for it.<lb facs="P3_TL00060"/>Inside such churches you will often find not only carefully<lb facs="P3_TL00061"/>cherished work from the ages of faith, which you expect to find<lb facs="P3_TL00062"/>noble and lovely, but sometimes a quite modern furnishing of<lb facs="P3_TL00063"/>the interior and draping of the altar, evidently done, not by<lb facs="P3_TL00064"/>contract with a firm celebrated for its illustrated catalogues, but<lb facs="P3_TL00065"/>by someone who loved and understood the church, and when<lb facs="P3_TL00066"/>baffled in the search for beautiful things, had at least succeeded<lb facs="P3_TL00067"/>in avoiding indecently commercial and incongruous ones. And<lb facs="P3_TL00068"/>then the search for beauty is not always baffled.

Go to Milan,<lb facs="P3_TL00104"/>and join the rush of tourists to its petrified christening-cake of<lb facs="P3_TL00105"/>a cathedral. The projectors of that costly ornament spared no<lb facs="P3_TL00106"/>expense to prove that their devotion was ten times greater than<lb facs="P3_TL00107"/>that of the builders of San Ambrogio. But every pound they<lb facs="P3_TL00108"/>spent only recorded in marble that their devotion was a hundred<lb facs="P3_TL00109"/>times less. Go on to Florence and try San Lorenzo, a really<lb facs="P3_TL00110"/>noble church (which the Milan Cathedral is not,) Brunelleschi's<lb facs="P3_TL00111"/>masterpiece. You cannot but admire its intellectual command<lb facs="P3_TL00112"/>of form, its unaffected dignity, its power and accomplishment, its<lb facs="P3_TL00113"/>masterly combination of simplicity and homogeneity of plan<lb facs="P3_TL00114"/>with elegance and variety of detail: you are even touched by<lb facs="P3_TL00115"/>the retention of that part of the beauty of the older time which<lb facs="P3_TL00116"/>was perceptible to the Renascent intellect before its weaning<lb facs="P3_TL00117"/>from heavenly food had been followed by starvation. You<lb facs="P3_TL00118"/>understand the deep and serious respect which Michael Angelo<lb facs="P3_TL00119"/>had for Brunelleschi—why he said "I can do different work,<lb facs="P3_TL00120"/>but not better." But a few minutes walk to Santa Maria<lb facs="P3_TL00121"/>Novella or Santa Croce, or a turn in the steam tram to San<lb facs="P3_TL00122"/>Miniato, will bring you to churches built a century or two<lb facs="P3_TL00123"/>earlier; and you have only to cross their thresholds to feel,<lb facs="P3_TL00124"/>almost before you have smelt the incense, the difference between<lb facs="P3_TL00125"/>a church built to the pride and glory of God (not to mention<lb facs="P3_TL00126"/>the Medici) and one built as a sanctuary shielded by God's<lb facs="P3_TL00127"/>presence from pride and glory and all the other burdens of life.<lb facs="P3_TL00128"/>In San Lorzeno up goes your head—every isolating advantage<lb facs="P3_TL00129"/>you have of talent, power or rank asserts itself with thrilling<lb facs="P3_TL00130"/>poignancy.<lb facs="P3_TL00131"/>In the old churches you forget yourself, and are the equal<lb facs="P3_TL00132"/>of the begger at the door, standing on ground made holy by<lb facs="P3_TL00133"/>that labor in which we have discovered the reality of prayer.<lb facs="P3_TL00134"/>You may also hit on a church like the Santissima Annunziata,<lb facs="P3_TL00135"/>carefully and expensively brought up-to-date, quite in our<lb facs="P3_TL00136"/>modern church-restoring manner, by generations of princes<lb facs="P3_TL00137"/>chewing the cud of the Renascence; and there you will see the<lb facs="P3_TL00138"/>worship of glory and the self-sufficiency of intellect giving way<lb facs="P3_TL00139"/>to the display of wealth and elegance as a guarantee of social<lb facs="P3_TL00140"/>importance—in another word, snobbery.<lb facs="P3_TL00141"/>In later edifices you see how intellect, finding its worshippers<lb facs="P3_TL00142"/>growing colder, had to abandon its dignity and cut capers to<lb facs="P3_TL00143"/>attract attention, giving the grotesque, the eccentric, the baroque,<lb facs="P3_TL00144"/>even the profane and blasphemous, until, finally, it is thoroughly<lb facs="P3_TL00145"/>snubbed out of its vulgar attempts at self-assertion, and mopes<lb facs="P3_TL00146"/>conventionally in our modern churches of St. Nicholas Without<lb facs="P3_TL00147"/>and St. Walker Within, locked up, except at service time, from<lb facs="P3_TL00148"/>week's end without ever provoking the smallest protest from a<lb facs="P3_TL00149"/>public only too glad to have an excuse for not going into them.<lb facs="P3_TL00150"/>You may read the same history of the human soul in any art you<lb facs="P3_TL00151"/>like to select; but he who runs may read it in the streets by<lb facs="P3_TL00152"/>looking at the churches.</ab>

A novel or two, some stories, a<lb facs="P5_TL00043"/>play, essays and tentative poems were passionately, arduously,<lb facs="P5_TL00044"/>awkwardly, silently and secretly committed to paper. "Edna"<lb facs="P5_TL00045"/>was one of these. It was the lad's own experience, "Amos Lane"<lb facs="P5_TL00046"/>his nom-de-guerre in the telling of it.<lb facs="P5_TL00047"/>The story was presented to Mr. Bruno and published by him<lb facs="P5_TL00048"/>about two years ago.

I have done so, and offer herewith<lb facs="P5_TL00056"/>the following paragraph:<lb facs="P5_TL00057"/>"Edna" is not a story one would choose for reading aloud<lb facs="P5_TL00058"/>to a seminary of young ladies. But it was evidently not intended<lb facs="P5_TL00059"/>for that benign purpose. Nor can it be termed an immortal<lb facs="P5_TL00060"/>achievement, in the light of what artistry it does not contain.<lb facs="P5_TL00061"/>It is, however, so clean and so honest a transcription of one<lb facs="P5_TL00062"/>phase of a theme which will always be timely, as to have held<lb facs="P5_TL00063"/>my attention by its sheer humanity. Not the least interesting<lb facs="P5_TL00064"/>trait is the outright self-condemnation of the author. In a<lb facs="P5_TL00065"/>phrase, the really poignant sincerity of the effort moves me to<lb facs="P5_TL00066"/>confess that I am proud of my close affiliation with the author.<lb facs="P5_TL00067"/>I may even go so far as to say that I am ashamed of all those<lb facs="P5_TL00068"/>compositions since perpetrated on my part in which I may have<lb facs="P5_TL00069"/>fallen short of the ideal of truthfulness so frankly championed in<lb facs="P5_TL00070"/>Edna."

The station platform<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>was crowded with citizens, trying to get a glimpse of "wild<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>Oscar," as they called him, and these were anxiously watching<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>the door of the car where the Evangelist might be supposed to<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>be, while he was quietly getting into a carriage and getting<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>under way for Lamy's.

He was received with a polite friendliness that was<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>winning. The Apostle had no lily nor yet a sun flower. He wore<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>a velvet jacket which seemed to be a good jacket.

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>sensus of the opinions of Amherst people decides that Oscar's<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>hair is not good. It is the color of straw, slightly leonime, and<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>straight as an Indian's. It is faded and bleached looking, and<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>when not looked after goes climbing all over his features. Mr.<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>Wilde was communicative and genial. He said that he found<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>Canada pleasant. He liked the scenery of New Brunswick, as<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>it lent itself readily to art. There were no towering mountains,<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>and deep gulches such as he had seen in the West. There were<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>no large rivers, but the scenery was always changing as one<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>passed through. Every turn in the road brought a small surprise.<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>The streams wound attractively through the land, and there<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>were innumerable hills and valleys of all conceivable forms.<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>Had our autumn forests finer colors than those in England?<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>Well, he would not say that.

I told Mr. Wilde that years ago I had ventured to lay<lb facs="P7_TL00123"/>down as the glaring defect of all Canadian pictures that they<lb facs="P7_TL00124"/>showed an entire want of the power of drawing with exactitude<lb facs="P7_TL00125"/>any living forms, trees or animals. This he earnestly and almost<lb facs="P7_TL00126"/>passionately approved. "Art," said he, "is not looked upon as<lb facs="P7_TL00127"/>an exact science, as it should be; there can be no art without<lb facs="P7_TL00128"/>truth of form, and no beauty can exist where is falsehood in<lb facs="P7_TL00129"/>drawing or color."</ab>

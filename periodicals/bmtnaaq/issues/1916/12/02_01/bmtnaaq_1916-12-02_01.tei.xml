The<lb facs="P5_TL00114"/>Austro-Hungarian Empire may be an intolerable hotch-potch of<lb facs="P5_TL00115"/>nationalities, and the Hapsburg the most oppressive of all<lb facs="P5_TL00116"/>rulers, but the Austrians, the gay Vienennese or the men of the<lb facs="P5_TL00117"/>Tyrolâthese are really leisurely, attractive people.

She is like a man<lb facs="P5_TL00122"/>who has made a deal of money out of soap; Austria is rather<lb facs="P5_TL00123"/>the finished aristocrat among nations. Let one of Arthur<lb facs="P5_TL00124"/>Schnitzler's little "Anatol" plays represent Vienna to you; you<lb facs="P5_TL00125"/>get the impression of a gay, unconcerned people, loose and<lb facs="P5_TL00126"/>wicked perhaps, but with polish and not too much feverish<lb facs="P5_TL00127"/>industry or seriousness. No one outside France knows how to<lb facs="P5_TL00128"/>turn a compliment so neatly as the characters of these little<lb facs="P5_TL00129"/>playsâwhich, by the way, should be read, if possible, in the<lb facs="P5_TL00130"/>original and not in Granville Barker's adaptation. You will<lb facs="P5_TL00131"/>have the impression that in Austria there is a sense of form and<lb facs="P5_TL00132"/>style which Germany has indeed begun to acquire, but only in<lb facs="P5_TL00133"/>a very external and artificial fashion.

He should be known, too, for his versions of classical<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>drama such as "King CEdipus and the Sphinx," for his lyrical<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>dramas such as "The Death of Titian" (1892), "The White<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>Fan" (1897), and"The Fool of Death" (1893), where the<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>tradition is mostly Stefan Georg's carried over into a loose<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>dramatic form, and for his poems, which are full of symbolist<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>influence conveyed from Mallarme through Georg and the<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>"Blatter fur die Kunst" pioneers.

To forward to your sweetheart a book which you<lb facs="P6_TL00086"/>have not read, or to lay it under the Christmas tree for your<lb facs="P6_TL00087"/>wife or for your child is synonimous with introducing a stranger<lb facs="P6_TL00088"/>as a friend to those who will take him in as your friend ; who<lb facs="P6_TL00089"/>will open to him heart and home, because of the love and<lb facs="P6_TL00090"/>esteem they have for you.

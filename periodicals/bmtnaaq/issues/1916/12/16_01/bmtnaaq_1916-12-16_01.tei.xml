Consequently, when a Witness reporter was<lb facs="P2_TL00114"/>ushered into the poet's room at the Windsor Hotel this morning,<lb facs="P2_TL00115"/>his personal as well as professional curiosity was somewhat<lb facs="P2_TL00116"/>disappointed to find no poet visible.

"Here," said Mr. Wilde, "is a letter only received this<lb facs="P2_TL00014"/>morning, referring to tbe effect of my visit to Philadelphia last<lb facs="P2_TL00015"/>week." The letter was from Charles Leland, the famous "Hans<lb facs="P2_TL00016"/>Breitmann," and a member of ''the school," thanking Mr. Wilde<lb facs="P2_TL00017"/>for the good he had done in connection with the teaching of<lb facs="P2_TL00018"/>art principles to the young. These results are being seen in<lb facs="P2_TL00019"/>the increase of orders given to the art societies. Mr. Wilde<lb facs="P2_TL00020"/>mentioned an incident which showed the way in which he was<lb facs="P2_TL00021"/>able to help on native art. In Chicago he came across a young<lb facs="P2_TL00022"/>American sculptor of really extrordinary power and genius,<lb facs="P2_TL00023"/>but unknown. He spoke about him, and told the people that<lb facs="P2_TL00024"/>they could not really appreciate art if they neglected the native<lb facs="P2_TL00025"/>talent in their own city.

"In America, you see, I have<lb facs="P2_TL00030"/>for the first time been face to face with people who have never<lb facs="P2_TL00031"/>seen any good art; as to their reception of what I say, while,<lb facs="P2_TL00032"/>no doubt, many come to hear me just from curiosity, yet after<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

It might be thought otherwise from those<lb facs="P2_TL00054"/>who live in beautiful places not speaking about beauty, but<lb facs="P2_TL00055"/>they have no need to talk about it. That is our object. We<lb facs="P2_TL00056"/>want to see the homes of the people beautiful, and when that<lb facs="P2_TL00057"/>is the case people will no longer talk of the beautiful at all.<lb facs="P2_TL00058"/>We are forced to do so now because there are so many ugly<lb facs="P2_TL00059"/>things in the world. In the ideal state of art there will be no<lb facs="P2_TL00060"/>art lecturer.<lb facs="P2_TL00061"/>Mr. Wilde went on to speak of the knowledge of art in the<lb facs="P2_TL00062"/>different countries, England and America."In England, now,<lb facs="P2_TL00063"/>we have the great advantage of models of art always with us,<lb facs="P2_TL00064"/>in the cathedrals, in the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge,<lb facs="P2_TL00065"/>and in many buildings of the finest architecture. In America<lb facs="P2_TL00066"/>the great want is of absolute models of art. The art which is<lb facs="P2_TL00067"/>learned from books is very worthless at best." Speaking of<lb facs="P2_TL00068"/>the aims of the movement with which he is identified, Mr.<lb facs="P2_TL00069"/>Wilde urged strongly that people should occupv a good deal<lb facs="P2_TL00070"/>more of their time with simple things. &gt; ''It is all very well to<lb facs="P2_TL00071"/>devote time to little flower vases; they do for ladies' drawing<lb facs="P2_TL00072"/>rooms, but that is not touching the people.

Shortly after<lb facs="P3_TL00035"/>noon, on the invitation of the Society of Artists, the apostle<lb facs="P3_TL00036"/>visited the exhibition of paintings in the Society's rooms on<lb facs="P3_TL00037"/>King Street.

Mr. Martin who acted as cicerone had<lb facs="P3_TL00053"/>to stand by and hear praise lavished on more than one of his<lb facs="P3_TL00054"/>own pictures. But H. R. Watson's paintings took Mr. Wilde's<lb facs="P3_TL00055"/>fancy most. He expressed great surprise when he learned the<lb facs="P3_TL00056"/>artist's age and that he had never been to Paris. "He has <lb facs="P3_TL00057"/>exact manner of the modern French artists."<lb facs="P3_TL00058"/>Mr. Wilde afterwards went to the University in company<lb facs="P3_TL00059"/>with Professor Pike, who is a college mate. In conversation<lb facs="P3_TL00060"/>with the reporter, Oscar said that he approved of the outward<lb facs="P3_TL00061"/>designs of the Canadian architects, but in most instances the<lb facs="P3_TL00062"/>interior colouring was bad.

                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00099"/>He is picturesque. But sometimes the picturesque requires<lb facs="P3_TL00100"/>distance. Too near, Oscar Wilde has too much of the neutral<lb facs="P3_TL00101"/>tint. The gray of the velvet and the gray of the face make<lb facs="P3_TL00102"/>the monotone—to change the figure—a little weary. See him<lb facs="P3_TL00103"/>on the platform and listen to him. Then, there is a man whom<lb facs="P3_TL00104"/>no man or woman will fail to recognize as among the highest.<lb facs="P3_TL00105"/>Is Milton high? The man whose youth produced L'Allegro<lb facs="P3_TL00106"/>and Comus, and, when he was poor, old and blind—the vision<lb facs="P3_TL00107"/>of Paradise Lost. Then is Oscar Wilde high. His is the first<lb facs="P3_TL00108"/>Miltonic face there has been in England since John Milton.<lb facs="P3_TL00109"/>John the Divine—John the beloved—who laid his head on the<lb facs="P3_TL00110"/>breast of Christ, and in solitary exile saw the Apocalypse—<lb facs="P3_TL00111"/>Oscar Wilde's face is such as the classic painters give to him.<lb facs="P3_TL00112"/>He also has a gospel-—yet no new gospel, for Christ compre<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

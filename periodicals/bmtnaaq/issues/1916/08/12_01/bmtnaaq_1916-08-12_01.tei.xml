She was constructed of pipe and palmetto logs,<lb facs="P4_TL00028"/>her armor being railway iron, and her iron turrets were<lb facs="P4_TL00029"/>six inches thick. In the same year the Confederates at<lb facs="P4_TL00030"/>Charleston used a submarine boat against the blockading<lb facs="P4_TL00031"/>Federal squadron.

It is surmised that American<lb facs="P4_TL00086"/>submarines were used by Admiral Togo to destroy the<lb facs="P4_TL00087"/>Russian Fleet in the Sea of Japan in 1905.<lb facs="P4_TL00088"/>Among the requirements of the first Holland boat was<lb facs="P4_TL00089"/>that it should make 8 knots per hour for 6 hours, and<lb facs="P4_TL00090"/>reach a depth of 20 feet in one minute after receiving<lb facs="P4_TL00091"/>orders to dive. By 1910 the United States had 27 of<lb facs="P4_TL00092"/>these torpedo boats, some of which have made good<lb facs="P4_TL00093"/>records. The U. S. submarine "Narwhale" has made<lb facs="P4_TL00094"/>two clean hits out of four at a distance of 2000 yards<lb facs="P4_TL00095"/>while traveling at full speed and 40 feet below surface.<lb facs="P4_TL00096"/>It may also be noted that the small U. S. submarine<lb facs="P4_TL00097"/>"Petrel" during the Spanish War easily destroyed two<lb facs="P4_TL00098"/>Spanish torpedo boats.<lb facs="P4_TL00099"/>Thus after hundreds of years of tireless and dangerous<lb facs="P4_TL00100"/>experiment, man's ingenuity won the day, and we have<lb facs="P4_TL00101"/>only to read the war despatches of the past few weeks<lb facs="P4_TL00102"/>to realize that the submarine war-ship, as a great designer<lb facs="P4_TL00103"/>of them (John P.

Whatever defects there are will doubtless<lb facs="P4_TL00112"/>be removed before long. A cardinal defed: is the inability<lb facs="P4_TL00113"/>of the submarine to see further than a few yards when<lb facs="P4_TL00114"/>submerged; its restricted radius of action and low speed<lb facs="P4_TL00115"/>come next, and then there is to be considered the cramped,<lb facs="P4_TL00116"/>confined life of the crew which is very enervating.<lb facs="P4_TL00117"/>But there is little doubt that these obstacles to perfect<lb facs="P4_TL00118"/>control and swift action will be overcome, and in the<lb facs="P4_TL00119"/>fulness of time perhaps a more peaceful field of activity<lb facs="P4_TL00120"/>and usefulness for submarine craft may open up when<lb facs="P4_TL00121"/>they are used for commercial travel, marine surveying,<lb facs="P4_TL00122"/>and in locating and removing sunken treasure.<lb facs="P4_TL00123"/>A notable instance of the fear in which submarine war<lb facs="P4_TL00124"/>vessels are held was on the occasion of the sinking of the<lb facs="P4_TL00125"/>"Aldabaran" in the North Sea by the Russian war-ship<lb facs="P4_TL00126"/>"Kamschatka" a few years ago.

He was no longer a fighter. On the<lb facs="P5_TL00044"/>contrary, he appeared tired and as if disillusioned. He<lb facs="P5_TL00045"/>seemed weighed down by a great sorrow. It flashed across<lb facs="P5_TL00046"/>my mind that in his limpid eyes, deep behind the arch of<lb facs="P5_TL00047"/>his brows, I saw an expression of unspeakable suffering—<lb facs="P5_TL00048"/>like a reflection of destpair, of irremediable nostalgia.<lb facs="P5_TL00049"/>All Mirbeau seems revealed in these two attitudes.

                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00010"/>tinguished actor in the metropolis of the world, is a long<lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>stretch. This, however, has been accomplished by Herbert<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>Beerbohm, later Mr. Tree and now Sir Herbert Tree.<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>To-day, Sir Herbert Tree is an institution. Londoners<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>attend his productions as faithfully as they patronize the<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>Derby races. And like all institutions, he is likely to<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>arouse the criticism and often the ire of the young artist,<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>pulsating with a restlessness and a hunger for newer<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>inroads into life and beauty.<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>The home of Tree productions is His Majesty's Theatre<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>in Haymarket, truly one of the most magnificent and<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>beautiful playhouses in London. Here there is presented<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>a continual flow of new and old plays, in which the art<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>of Tree as producer, manager and actor is afforded the<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>fullest scope and before an audience that is ever ready to<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>applaud, to acclaim and to praise. In defining this<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>peculiar hold over a vast number of playgoers evercised<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>by Tree, it is necessary to point out that he has always<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>sat on the right side of the public. Tree's attitude has<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>been that the public can be trusted to appreciate the good<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>and high in drama and when a very fine type of play had<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>been placed with infinite care upon the boards of His<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>Majesty's Theatre and had not received the support that<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>it deserved, Tree has been very careful not to harrangue<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>the public for their lack of appreciation. Good-humoredly<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>he taken his "defeat" and the public was given to<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>understand that the management of His Majesty's Theatre<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>understands its attitude. Thus with a public that "has<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>ever been diplomatically and gently handled, Tree has<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>established himself as a marked favourite of whom it is<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>proud and of whom it carries the illusion (this is<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>important) that it "possesses." The public is never happy<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>with a dramatist like Shaw, whom it can never control or<lb facs="P12_TL00043"/>a politician like Lloyd George capable of outbursts or a<lb facs="P12_TL00044"/>man like Winston Churchill ever on the verge of changing<lb facs="P12_TL00045"/>political colour. The public requires of its idols that they<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>shall meet with its fixed ideas of, them. Thus they like<lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>Asquith in politics; Mrs. Humphrey Ward in literature;<lb facs="P12_TL00048"/>the"Daily News" in Journalism and Herbert Tree in the<lb facs="P12_TL00049"/>theatre.<lb facs="P12_TL00050"/>All this might be taken as a disparagement of the noted<lb facs="P12_TL00051"/>actor. But this is not meant. As an actor, Tree stands<lb facs="P12_TL00052"/>out to-day as one of the foremost in his profession. What<lb facs="P12_TL00053"/>he has done, however, which will prove of little importance<lb facs="P12_TL00054"/>when the summing of his life work is considered, is his<lb facs="P12_TL00055"/>attempt with that of Sir George Alexander to make acting<lb facs="P12_TL00056"/>a "respectable" profession, instead of allowing it to re<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>footed and it's just a joy," she said. She told him she had<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>to fix her sixter's doll; she never played with dolls, they<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>were so foolish. She laughed and said, "It ain't hard to<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>have a baby. I know all about it." He answered, "Shut up<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>now." Jean told him he would have to be good now until<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>he died, because his mother would know everything he did.<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>When they came by the house again she wanted to sit on<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>the steps. "It's so nice here because nobody's inside; but<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>we'll have to talk in whispers, anyway, on account of your<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>mother." She asked him, "What would you rather be,<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>Martin? I'd rather be a heroine and save a child from a<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>fire—and be all scarred up so I had to stay in the hospital<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>and get flowers." He said she would surely court death;<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>that her dress would fly out and catch a flame if there<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>were any to speak of. She said, "Yes, I know it's awful;<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>but it would be fun, too." Then she told him he would<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>be rich now, with only himself. She sighed and scratched<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>her hand on his rough one, as she always did when they<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>were alone.

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>cause then she would tussle with him and sometimes he<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>would hurt her. Martin thought from what she said and<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>did that she liked being hurt more than anything.<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>He said no, he would never be any good and could not<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>ever marry, because he might have children. He thought<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>it was wrong to have children unless you could send them<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>to school even after they got big. "Yes, all our people<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>are such fools," said Jean. She was standing up on the<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>step and he was below her. She suddenly closed her eyes<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>and stiffened up. Then she said, "Oh!" and started to<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>fall. He caught her just in time and her weight came<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>full against him. He wondered that she was so light and<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>. seemed so little. All at once he felt himself aching all<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>over and did not remember anything more except her hair<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>in his mouth and her face in front of his, right up against<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>it. The face did not seem like hers at all, it was close to<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>him, and it was three times as big as hers and looked so<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>wild. They both made funny little sounds in their throats<lb facs="P18_TL00046"/>when he let her go. Martin's throat was so dry he Could<lb facs="P18_TL00047"/>not speak. He took her arm without knowing it and they<lb facs="P18_TL00048"/>walked to her house. She laid her head on his shoulder</ab>

He thought she was crying, but when she<lb facs="P18_TL00051"/>looked up he saw she was laughing. "I was so scared,<lb facs="P18_TL00052"/>Martin, darling," she said. "Something pushed me off the<lb facs="P18_TL00053"/>step. It kept pushing me right at you and I couldn't stop."<lb facs="P18_TL00054"/>He was scared, too, and shivered and they held each other<lb facs="P18_TL00055"/>tighter. Presently she said, "Now, you must always tell<lb facs="P18_TL00056"/>me I'm pretty, but if you don't mean it, I'll know by your<lb facs="P18_TL00057"/>}y<lb facs="P18_TL00058"/>voice.<lb facs="P18_TL00059"/>After she had gone in he felt he was perspiring all over.<lb facs="P18_TL00060"/>He went home and splashed water on himself. When he<lb facs="P18_TL00061"/>started to fix the clock he remembered what she said about<lb facs="P18_TL00062"/>it and wanted to throw it out of the window.<lb facs="P18_TL00063"/>The next night Martin tried to see her again and she<lb facs="P18_TL00064"/>told him she would never let herself out of somebody's<lb facs="P18_TL00065"/>sight with him again; that she might have known he had<lb facs="P18_TL00066"/>no chivalry. He said to quit beating around the bush, to<lb facs="P18_TL00067"/>tell him what was the trouble. She had a bucket with<lb facs="P18_TL00068"/>some eggs in it, taking it home. She held it up and said,<lb facs="P18_TL00069"/>"Let me pass." Martin stood in her way and she tried<lb facs="P18_TL00070"/>to dodge past him, but he stopped her everv time. She<lb facs="P18_TL00071"/>said, "You'd have had more senses not to take advantage<lb facs="P18_TL00072"/>of a fainting woman." It made him so mad he held her<lb facs="P18_TL00073"/>and kissed her about twenty times. She said it was not<lb facs="P18_TL00074"/>her that let him, but the eggs, and he need not flatter him<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

He made her sit down and told her life had<lb facs="P18_TL00079"/>got to be hard with him now; he did not think like he<lb facs="P18_TL00080"/>used to, and if his mother was back it would be better for<lb facs="P18_TL00081"/>him, because he knew he had lost her too soon for his own<lb facs="P18_TL00082"/>good. Jean straightened up and tried to look like a teacher<lb facs="P18_TL00083"/>in school and took his hand and said, "Now it's my duty<lb facs="P18_TL00084"/>tp take her place and I've been such a fool not to know<lb facs="P18_TL00085"/>what you meant." She said it was hard for a girl to<lb facs="P18_TL00086"/>know when she had any friends and she did not really hate<lb facs="P18_TL00087"/>him at all, but something had told her tj acr tnat way.<lb facs="P18_TL00088"/>He was so glad to feel her hand* again she said he almost<lb facs="P18_TL00089"/>broke her thumb. Then she kissed him on the cheek and<lb facs="P18_TL00090"/>said, "I've always hated myself, and now more than ever.''<lb facs="P18_TL00091"/>She came over every day, long enough, anyway, to move<lb facs="P18_TL00092"/>something so he would know she had been there. He got<lb facs="P18_TL00093"/>so he would take everything in the house that she had<lb facs="P18_TL00094"/>touched and hold it against his coat, where his heart ought<lb facs="P18_TL00095"/>to be, for a minute. They went out together almost every<lb facs="P18_TL00096"/>night for a walk or in the park or to one of the gardens.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00062"/>lion of war, I have been able, since my return, to discover<lb facs="P3_TL00063"/>how completely it disorganized the literary world, and the<lb facs="P3_TL00064"/>commercial concerns which depend upon the literary<lb facs="P3_TL00065"/>world. At the end of July the monthly financial accounts<lb facs="P3_TL00066"/>of the French publishing houses, with their agencies in<lb facs="P3_TL00067"/>the provinces and abroad, had not been settled. TL here<lb facs="P3_TL00068"/>was, therefore, a lack of money, which had an immediate<lb facs="P3_TL00069"/>effect on the writers themselves. From the first day it<lb facs="P3_TL00070"/>was certain that the literary world would have much to<lb facs="P3_TL00071"/>suffer if the war were to be a long one. When I returned<lb facs="P3_TL00072"/>at the beginning of October, committees of relief had been<lb facs="P3_TL00073"/>organized for writers, and the "Societe des Gens de<lb facs="P3_TL00074"/>Lett res" had instituted free dinners for its members. It<lb facs="P3_TL00075"/>is apparent how rapidly distress had broken out since they<lb facs="P3_TL00076"/>had had to raise such Homeric remedies.<lb facs="P3_TL00077"/>It is only now that I begin to understand how closely<lb facs="P3_TL00078"/>even the most disinterested productions of genius are<lb facs="P3_TL00079"/>governed by the general conditions of social life. Liberty<lb facs="P3_TL00080"/>of the mind is the first necessity, but prosperity and<lb facs="P3_TL00081"/>equilibrium of the nation are also necessary. And a nation<lb facs="P3_TL00082"/>at war, above all a nation which has war within its own<lb facs="P3_TL00083"/>frontiers, can never be a prosperous nor a well-balanced<lb facs="P3_TL00084"/>nation. Even supposingâ€”an absurd propositionâ€”that the<lb facs="P3_TL00085"/>war had disorganized neither commerce nor industry, in<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00086"/>tellectual productions would not have been disturbed.<lb facs="P3_TL00087"/>There is a close relation between the different parts of an<lb facs="P3_TL00088"/>organism, and if disintegration had not begun in the lesser<lb facs="P3_TL00089"/>parts it would have begun in the greater.

                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00092"/>tinies are daily at stake. But the truth is that all parts<lb facs="P3_TL00093"/>of the literary organism were attacked at once. The<lb facs="P3_TL00094"/>writers could not write, the printers could not print, the<lb facs="P3_TL00095"/>readers could not buy and read. The literary organism<lb facs="P3_TL00096"/>slept. It still sleeps, and no one knows when it will be<lb facs="P3_TL00097"/>reawakened.<lb facs="P3_TL00098"/>Now for a few details. The Goncourt brothers, in the<lb facs="P3_TL00099"/>first pages of their "Journal," note, as one of the most<lb facs="P3_TL00100"/>distressing events of their literary career* that the coup<lb facs="P3_TL00101"/>d'etat of the second of December, 1851, occurred on the<lb facs="P3_TL00102"/>night which preceded the publication of their first book,<lb facs="P3_TL00103"/>"En 18â€”/' As a consequence this book remained abso<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00107"/>nition, practically all hope of publicity is lost. The works<lb facs="P3_TL00108"/>of the best writers now appear very late in the summer<lb facs="P3_TL00109"/>season and go straight to readers in the couniry or at the<lb facs="P3_TL00110"/>seaside. I know of several books which were going to be<lb facs="P3_TL00111"/>sent in this way. They have been spared a useless voyage,<lb facs="P3_TL00112"/>and they have remained done up in parcels.

It was full of<lb facs="P4_TL00010"/>confidence in the future:<lb facs="P4_TL00011"/>"L'avenir, l'avenir est a moi!<lb facs="P4_TL00012"/>Sire, 1' avenir n'est a personnel"â€”<lb facs="P4_TL00013"/>(Victor Hugo)<lb facs="P4_TL00014"/>At the bottom of what trench do these conscripts lie,<lb facs="P4_TL00015"/>what new fever had suddenly made them men of action?<lb facs="P4_TL00016"/>I have kept the only number of this Review.

They have no son on the battlefield,<lb facs="P4_TL00024"/>and as to their friends, they treat them less as motives of<lb facs="P4_TL00025"/>anxiety than as a means to gratify their vanity. Their<lb facs="P4_TL00026"/>businessâ€”they are naturally business menâ€”is, as they<lb facs="P4_TL00027"/>say, a business which deals in the first necessities of life,<lb facs="P4_TL00028"/>which has. been increased rather than depreciated by the<lb facs="P4_TL00029"/>war. Their employees are women or old men. They<lb facs="P4_TL00030"/>have taken their holidays as usual, but they found that<lb facs="P4_TL00031"/>the trains ran very badly. "Such a disgraceful state of<lb facs="P4_TL00032"/>things is very bad for business." As they only returned<lb facs="P4_TL00033"/>to Paris at the beginning of October, when Paris was<lb facs="P4_TL00034"/>refreshed and had come partially to life again, they have<lb facs="P4_TL00035"/>kept their good spirits. One phrase keeps coming up in<lb facs="P4_TL00036"/>their conversation: "Things have been greatly ex<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The book-buyer, who was<lb facs="P5_TL00006"/>thought to have vanished has reappeared, and, since there<lb facs="P5_TL00007"/>are no new books, he asks for last season's, and even for<lb facs="P5_TL00008"/>last year's. This is another symptom of a revival of litera<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00009"/>ture. Perhaps even when the enemy is driven from France<lb facs="P5_TL00010"/>a few new books might be published. To explain this it<lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>should be borne in mind that Paris, to which many rich<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>people returned during the month of October, is totally<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>deprived of amusements; there are no exhibitions, no<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>social gatherings, no horse races, no theatres. Everyone<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>feels the necessity for amusement, and everyone chooses<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>what is perhaps the most speculative, for a man of the<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>world, but the most secret and most discreetâ€”reading.<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>In certain circles they are beginning to think that it was<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>a mistake to close all the theatres. The reason given is<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>that numbers of actors and supers are on the streets, and<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>they are the less resigned to their fate since winter is<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>coming on and their hardships will become more and more<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>distressing. Here also they will proceed discreetly, and<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>little by little the drama will reoccupy a small niche in<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>the social world without the theatres being actually<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>opened; it is said that matinees will be organized in the<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>town-halls. They will not play dramas, but they will<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>recite poetry and read pages of good prose. This seems<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>to me very reasonable. It will be a step towards the<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>greatly desired reopening of a few theatres.<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>Yesterday I \met a dramatic author who confided his<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>woes to me. Whenever one goes out in Paris a meeting<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>with an actor or with a dramatic author is absolutely<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>certain; there are,, in fact, too many of them, especially<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>now when they are all out of work. This "homme de<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>theatre" was in a sort of despair. He had had a great<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>play, a kind of tragedy in prose, taken by the Theatre<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>Francais just before the war. "But," he said, "will<lb facs="P5_TL00039"/>people want tragedies after the war? They will have<lb facs="P5_TL00040"/>seen so many far crueller than any that could be invented.<lb facs="P5_TL00041"/>Will people not want less harrowing spectacles, which<lb facs="P5_TL00042"/>will entirely change our idea of things?" "Everything<lb facs="P5_TL00043"/>is possible," I replied, "but I am not going to embark on<lb facs="P5_TL00044"/>any kind of prophecies. That kind of boat is too often<lb facs="P5_TL00045"/>wrecked." a<lb facs="P5_TL00046"/>What will the theatre of to-morrow be, and what the<lb facs="P5_TL00047"/>literature? If we knew, it would be deprived of much<lb facs="P5_TL00048"/>of its interest; for all literary work, even the most serious,<lb facs="P5_TL00049"/>derives part of its value from the quality of novelty. It<lb facs="P5_TL00050"/>is always disappointing to find things happen exactly at<lb facs="P5_TL00051"/>the hour and in exactly the manner foretold. Genius<lb facs="P5_TL00052"/>loves surprises: we shall be surprised if genius has any<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00053"/>thing to do with the war. But will it? Shells and bullets<lb facs="P5_TL00054"/>also love surprises. A young officer, himself a writer,<lb facs="P5_TL00055"/>with whom I was discussing this question the other day<lb facs="P5_TL00056"/>on his return from the fifteenth battle during one month,<lb facs="P5_TL00057"/>said to me, "If the new literature is sincere it will be<lb facs="P5_TL00058"/>cynical like war itself. Those who have passed through<lb facs="P5_TL00059"/>it will have no illusions. They will know human nature<lb facs="P5_TL00060"/>through and through." He talked to me for a long time<lb facs="P5_TL00061"/>in this way, and even more bitterly. But he is, perhaps,<lb facs="P5_TL00062"/>an exception. Nothing changes a man's temperament.<lb facs="P5_TL00063"/>Each one will feel the war according to his nature, and<lb facs="P5_TL00064"/>that will be a very excellent thing.</ab>

He was born in Calcutta, India, and reared<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>in Italy and Switzerland.

His education he received at the Royal Academy of<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>Munich and came to this country twenty years ago. When<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>he grew tired of dear, old New York with its glittering<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>electric signs, he went to Mexico. That was in 1906.<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>Instead of painting the picturesque scenes of that marvel<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

He sleeps most<lb facs="P11_TL00050"/>of the day and wanders from cafe to cafe most of the<lb facs="P11_TL00051"/>night. With the fair sex he is most charming and gallant,<lb facs="P11_TL00052"/>but is galling bitter when he portrays them with pen or<lb facs="P11_TL00053"/>brush. But he is far from being a woman kater.

However, there are some people<lb facs="P12_TL00070"/>who never know when they have enough money. Never<lb facs="P12_TL00071"/>did I yet meet a man who said that he had enough money.<lb facs="P12_TL00072"/>Even I haven't enough, and I shall never get enough,<lb facs="P12_TL00073"/>though I realize the folly of making too much.

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>HAD been in New York only three weeks when I got a job<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>in Litchfield Co., Conn., where I lived altogether among<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>Yankees, and learned to speak English. But I found I could<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>not get my pay, my employer, a brigadier-general of the militia<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>and a walking whiskey-bottle, being insolvent. Therefore, after<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>six months of hard work and poor pay, I accepted a position in<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>D. on the Mississippi River, which happened to be freg. After<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>a year and a half I wanted, and asked for, a better position<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>which became free, but was refused, whereupon I threw up<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>my job and paddled my own canoe, i.e., gave lectures, did pri<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The course was for young ladies who<lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>wanted to improve their general education and she was one of<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>my class.

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00044"/>ment. She seemed to appreciate that, and after a month or so<lb facs="P16_TL00045"/>I was invited to call at her parents' residence.<lb facs="P16_TL00046"/>But there was a mutual dislike between her father and me!<lb facs="P16_TL00047"/>Most likely he soon saw the drift of things, and undoubtedly he<lb facs="P16_TL00048"/>wanted a son-in-law better situated than I. As for me, I had<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>heard of him, and seen him before, and what I heard and saw<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>gave me the impression that he was narrow-minded, egotistic,<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>was suffering from megalomania, and was apparently blind to<lb facs="P16_TL00052"/>his elder son's doings.<lb facs="P16_TL00053"/>There came a clash between us, and I wrote the young lady<lb facs="P16_TL00054"/>I would not call any more; if she really cared for me, as I for<lb facs="P16_TL00055"/>her, she should meet me at any place suiting her and we would<lb facs="P16_TL00056"/>talk matters over. Her answer was that she and her mother<lb facs="P16_TL00057"/>had prevailed upon her father to be decent and I should not<lb facs="P16_TL00058"/>hesitate to call again.<lb facs="P16_TL00059"/>I thought that over for a couple of days, and then cut the<lb facs="P16_TL00060"/>matter short by calling and proposing. She accepting me, I called<lb facs="P16_TL00061"/>upon the father, told him how matters stood, and asked for his<lb facs="P16_TL00062"/>consent, which he gave, though with a wry face.</ab>

"I am to dine with her this evening,<lb facs="P16_TL00083"/>and I'll tell her of her lonely little relative." Result, my cousin<lb facs="P16_TL00084"/>asked John to bring me to call, my steamer friend introduced<lb facs="P16_TL00085"/>us, and John fell in love with me at first sight. From that<lb facs="P16_TL00086"/>time on the dull gray days were turned to rosy ones. John<lb facs="P16_TL00087"/>asked me to marry him at once, was refused, but persisted, and<lb facs="P16_TL00088"/>in a few weeks we were engaged, and our wedding took place<lb facs="P16_TL00089"/>at my home six months after we met.<lb facs="P16_TL00090"/>After seventeen years of married life John is dearer than<lb facs="P16_TL00091"/>ever, and hardly a day passes that he does not tell me that I am<lb facs="P16_TL00092"/>dearer-to him.

It is the glory of his "Songs<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>of Armageddon/' much as that delta is the glory of the<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>Nile.

The whole<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>poem proceeds like a majestic procession climbing glorious<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>stairways to the sound of a chorus of angels. I have no<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>recollection of a metrical effect so tremendous. The thing<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>enchants me, like a favorite musical composition.<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>Faust knocks at Heaven's gate, "the musical gates," as<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>Viereck calls them with a rare effect. The effect upon<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>the angels is tremendous and is conveyed with all the fine,<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>thoroughbred arrogance of the poet. Although we are<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>told by one who should know that in Heaven there is<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>neither marrying nor giving in marriage, Viereck makes<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>some of the angels swoon in the arms of their mates.

On the contrary, he leaves<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>Heaven in a mood of the most beautiful disdain, after<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>hurling at God the single tremendous and unanswerable<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>query:<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>"Have you loved Helen of Troy and the blonde Mar<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00006"/>AND that was how the summer passed by. She told him<lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>everybody was getting to be strangers to her at home<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>and she hardly spoke to them any more; that the world<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>somehow was not the same* He said the foreman and the<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>"straw-boss" got him so mad, sometimes, he guessed hell<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>was not any hotter than the factory. He said it was all he<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>could do every day to keep from running out of the build<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>ing right to where she was, to tell her things. She said,<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>"Yes, and the worst of it is, I'd probably be right where<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>you went: we couldn't hope for any better luck at all.<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>He said he never could tell her the things, though, when<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>he saw her; he did not seem to want to, then. She said,<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>"Yes, you're a quiet man, but I have no rights, anyway.<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>One night they were sitting on the steps. She was<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>down below him, with her chin in her hands, and the<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>light from the l'amp inside fell upon the back of hei neck.<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>The breeze was blowing her hair over it and Martin<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>watched it, it was so white and soft, and he wanted to<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>take it in both hands between his fingers and strangle her<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>to death. When he told her what he wanted to do, she<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>said, "Oh, God, Martin, it might be for the best." He<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>put his hand on it and she never moved, as though she<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>were waiting for him to carry out the awful thieat. Then<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>she said, "If it was right for you to be in love with me,<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>I'd be glad you said that, because that's the way you ought<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>to feel. But you oughtn't to, because we're too good<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>friends to do like everybody else, and its just seeing each<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>other that counts." He said he would like to know what<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>friends are forâ€”with a girl. She got up and said if he<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>talked like that she would have to part from him forever.<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>She said, "Because you were only too right when you said<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>we shouldn't marry, not having money the way it is with<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>us." He said, who asked her to marry him? She said,<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>well, she was not begging for chances and he was getting<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>almost shameless; that she must call a halt. It got to<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>be such a quarrel they stormed at each other and the next<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>time they met they both felt bad and Martin apologized ;<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>and she said they just had to kiss and make up; that it<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>was only right, and she would submit with a glad heart.<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>They were sitting on the big hill in the park &gt;that same<lb facs="P18_TL00046"/>night, on the grass. It was a clear sky, with all the stars<lb facs="P18_TL00047"/>out bright, and the city was all a garden of lights; they<lb facs="P18_TL00048"/>could see them twinkling for miles and miles and the sky<lb facs="P18_TL00049"/>a dull red glow in front of their faces. Martin looked<lb facs="P18_TL00050"/>at the sky and thought it was so bright he was ten times<lb facs="P18_TL00051"/>as big as he was and everybody in the city could see him</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00052"/>sitting there on the hill with a girl beside him, and his<lb facs="P18_TL00053"/>trouble, and not knowing what to do. She was afraid,<lb facs="P18_TL00054"/>too, and moved away. They did not dare to touch each<lb facs="P18_TL00055"/>other. Suddenly she got up and ran away and Martin<lb facs="P18_TL00056"/>waited. He got scared after a few minutes and went to<lb facs="P18_TL00057"/>look for her. At first he could not find her, because she<lb facs="P18_TL00058"/>had gone in among the trees where it was darker. When<lb facs="P18_TL00059"/>he came up she was kneeling under one of the trees and<lb facs="P18_TL00060"/>leaning over so the tall grass was in her hair. He did not<lb facs="P18_TL00061"/>go right up, but he heard her moaning, "This can't go<lb facs="P18_TL00062"/>on!" She said it over and over again. He could hardly<lb facs="P18_TL00063"/>see and he stumbled over and &gt; fell beside her and his hands<lb facs="P18_TL00064"/>went all over her. She.said, "No, no, no!" and pushed<lb facs="P18_TL00065"/>him away wildly, and after a minute he got up and stood<lb facs="P18_TL00066"/>still, waiting for her to move. Pretty soon she got up<lb facs="P18_TL00067"/>and he took her arm. Part of the walk to the car he had<lb facs="P18_TL00068"/>to almost carry her. They sat beside each other, and<lb facs="P18_TL00069"/>never said a word; but everybody was laughing and<lb facs="P18_TL00070"/>talking around them. He was ashamed because her dress<lb facs="P18_TL00071"/>was torn at the throat and he had a great scratch on his<lb facs="P18_TL00072"/>cheek and thought everybody in the car was pointing at it.<lb facs="P18_TL00073"/>When he got to his house he took her arm and she came<lb facs="P18_TL00074"/>right in with him without a word. They went into the<lb facs="P18_TL00075"/>and he lighted the light and said, "Now you stay here.''<lb facs="P18_TL00076"/>She sat down as though she did not know what she was<lb facs="P18_TL00077"/>doing. He said down, too, after a minute and started to<lb facs="P18_TL00078"/>smoke. She got up and took one of his mother's aprons<lb facs="P18_TL00079"/>and put it on. He turned her right around and untied<lb facs="P18_TL00080"/>it and threw it in the corner. Then she jumped past him<lb facs="P18_TL00081"/>and ran out of the house and stood on the porch with her<lb facs="P18_TL00082"/>back against the railing; and said, "Now I'll talk to you<lb facs="P18_TL00083"/>here, Martin Hupp, if you have anything to say to me."<lb facs="P18_TL00084"/>Martin walked by her and sat down on the step like a<lb facs="P18_TL00085"/>crazy man and said, "I've said enough." She came beside<lb facs="P18_TL00086"/>him and threw her arms around him and said, "Oh, Mar<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00087"/>tin, how noble you are!" She kept hugging him and half<lb facs="P18_TL00088"/>crying and told him he would have to be man enough for<lb facs="P18_TL00089"/>both of them; that she was only a woman, and would have<lb facs="P18_TL00090"/>to give in if he said anything about wanting her. They<lb facs="P18_TL00091"/>sat there for a long time silent; and pretty soon every<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00092"/>thing seemed clear and bright to Martin all at once, and<lb facs="P18_TL00093"/>he turned to her and grinned and said: "Aw, hell, Jean,<lb facs="P18_TL00094"/>why not get married?" She stood up astonished and said:<lb facs="P18_TL00095"/>"Well! I guess you've got to ask a person." He asked<lb facs="P18_TL00096"/>her what she thought he was doing. She sat down again<lb facs="P18_TL00097"/>then close to him and sighed deeply and said, "Yes, dear."<lb facs="P18_TL00098"/>She said it was here moment. Martin just took her up<lb facs="P18_TL00099"/>like a baby and carried her home. He laughed because<lb facs="P18_TL00100"/>he held her arms and she could not do anything but<lb facs="P18_TL00101"/>squawk.</ab>

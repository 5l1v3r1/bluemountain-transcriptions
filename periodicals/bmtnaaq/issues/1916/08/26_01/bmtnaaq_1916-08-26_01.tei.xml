At a reception at Mr.<lb facs="P4_TL00071"/>Partridge's old Fourth Avenue studio, I once met one<lb facs="P4_TL00072"/>of our greatest actresses, Julia Marlowe (Mrs. Sothern),<lb facs="P4_TL00073"/>whom I had first seen in the West when she made her<lb facs="P4_TL00074"/>debut in "Romeo and Juliet."<lb facs="P4_TL00075"/>I was once John Gilmer Speed's guest at the Player's<lb facs="P4_TL00076"/>Club, in Gramercy Park, where, among other curiosities,<lb facs="P4_TL00077"/>I saw Edwin Booth's bedroom, which is preserved exactly<lb facs="P4_TL00078"/>as it was when the great Shakspearean interpreter died.<lb facs="P4_TL00079"/>Which reminds me of the first time I saw Booth. It was<lb facs="P4_TL00080"/>at Kansas City, Mo., at the Warder Grand Opera House<lb facs="P4_TL00081"/>—before the theatre had been completed. Booth and<lb facs="P4_TL00082"/>Barrett were the stars in "Hamlet;" it was zero weather,<lb facs="P4_TL00083"/>and the roof of the opera house had not been put on.<lb facs="P4_TL00084"/>There were few or no stage properties, and the poor ghost<lb facs="P4_TL00085"/>did the best he could in a sheet.

I was sitting in Amen Corner one<lb facs="P4_TL00091"/>morning, just about to leave the hotel for my steamer,<lb facs="P4_TL00092"/>when a tall gentleman, in a Prince Albert coat and beaver<lb facs="P4_TL00093"/>hat, came into the rotunda from the street. I recognized<lb facs="P4_TL00094"/>him instantly as Major McKiniey. Just as he reached<lb facs="P4_TL00095"/>the desk, another gentleman, similarly attired, stepped up<lb facs="P4_TL00096"/>to him, saying: "Hello, Governor!" and engaged him in<lb facs="P4_TL00097"/>conversation, only a few feet away from where I sat.<lb facs="P4_TL00098"/>Then the ex-Governor glanced around, and seeing that I<lb facs="P4_TL00099"/>was the sole occupant of Amen Corner, sat down beside<lb facs="P4_TL00100"/>me, the while chatting with his host who remained stand<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00101"/>ing. A few minutes later they strolled toward the reading<lb facs="P4_TL00102"/>room and bar. The Major was immaculately attired, his<lb facs="P4_TL00103"/>buttoned-up and closely fitting Prince Albert setting off<lb facs="P4_TL00104"/>his stalwart figure to the best advantage, giving him a<lb facs="P4_TL00105"/>most impressive presence. This was the only occasion on<lb facs="P4_TL00106"/>which I saw the distinguished man who later became our<lb facs="P4_TL00107"/>President, and who, years afterward, in the full flush of<lb facs="P4_TL00108"/>manhood, met his death at the hands of an assassin. I<lb facs="P4_TL00109"/>was only in the twenties when this rencontre took place,<lb facs="P4_TL00110"/>but it remains vividly in my memory.<lb facs="P4_TL00111"/>I have mentioned Washington Irving's old home on<lb facs="P4_TL00112"/>Irving Place. I once saw, at one of the Astor Estate<lb facs="P4_TL00113"/>offices, the ledgers he used to keep, just before Mr. Astor<lb facs="P4_TL00114"/>sent him with a full purse to Europe, where he wrote<lb facs="P4_TL00115"/>his "Sketch Book." Through the influence of Sir Walter<lb facs="P4_TL00116"/>Scott he found a publisher in England, and, of course,<lb facs="P4_TL00117"/>the only true first edition of the "Sketch Book," is this,<lb facs="P4_TL00118"/>the English one. Fitz-Greene Halleck, the poet, it will<lb facs="P4_TL00119"/>be remembered, was a superintendent of the Astor Estate<lb facs="P4_TL00120"/>on 26th Street.<lb facs="P4_TL00121"/>Thus, in the course of a quarter century's residence in<lb facs="P4_TL00122"/>and about the heart of New York City, it was my good<lb facs="P4_TL00123"/>fortune to meet no less than two men of mark who became<lb facs="P4_TL00124"/>Chief Magistrates of the Nation, many authors, artists,<lb facs="P4_TL00125"/>sculptors, journalists and actors already famous, or who<lb facs="P4_TL00126"/>quickly joined the Immortals, and a glittering galaxy of<lb facs="P4_TL00127"/>distinguished men and women from all parts of the world.</ab>

Frogs in a nearby marsh<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>croaked their weird mystic chants, and the breeze rustled<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>musically through the trees.

To ask her for her hand seemed an<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>impossibility, and the very thought choked in my throat. I<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>stopped abruptly and she paused too. For the minute the frogs<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>ceased their croaking and the breeze halted. Somehow she<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>seemed to know and stepped a wee bit closer. Her arm touched<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>mine and in the next instant I held her to me.

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00038"/>rjp HIRTEEN Years ago. I was the son of a wealthy family.<lb facs="P16_TL00039"/>When I came home one evening, a new maid opened the<lb facs="P16_TL00040"/>door. She was beautiful and seemed like a lady masquerading.<lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>One glance from her quickly-lowered eyes made my heart turn<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>in my breast and I was hers from that moment. Then began<lb facs="P16_TL00043"/>a strange courtship. I would steal down in the early morning,<lb facs="P16_TL00044"/>when she was setting the table, before the rest were up. She<lb facs="P16_TL00045"/>refused to listen to me and threatened to tell my folks if I did<lb facs="P16_TL00046"/>not leave her alone. But somehow, I knew she cared for me.<lb facs="P16_TL00047"/>Her presence in the house was a delicious agony and I was<lb facs="P16_TL00048"/>persistent. On her nights off, I used to wait down on the<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>corner. And finally one night, she cried, and begged me to<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>leave her alone, that I was too good for her. But I knew<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>better and took her in my arms, and in six weeks after she first<lb facs="P16_TL00052"/>opened the door to me, we were married.<lb facs="P16_TL00053"/>The family were horrified and cast me out, out of their home<lb facs="P16_TL00054"/>and out of their business. I didn't care, I had my love and was<lb facs="P16_TL00055"/>content. We started housekeeping in a tenement with a bed,<lb facs="P16_TL00056"/>a table, two hard chairs and a one-burner gas stove. Our<lb facs="P16_TL00057"/>money went while I walked the streets looking for work. For<lb facs="P16_TL00058"/>two days we lived on half a loaf of rye bread and water. I<lb facs="P16_TL00059"/>finally got a job at hard, unaccustomed labor, for ten dollars<lb facs="P16_TL00060"/>a week. We were very happy, she and I. Since then, the<lb facs="P16_TL00061"/>baby came, and sickness and hard times and all sorts of troubles<lb facs="P16_TL00062"/>but my little maid and I are still truly wedded and content<lb facs="P16_TL00063"/>and it is thirteen years since she first opened the door to me.</ab>

Not having<lb facs="P16_TL00067"/>many acquaintances in the city, I readily accepted the invij<lb facs="P16_TL00068"/>tation of a classmate to visit him at his Home and meet 1™<lb facs="P16_TL00069"/>people. * J |<lb facs="P16_TL00070"/>There I met his sister—*young and attractive looking. Wit;<lb facs="P16_TL00071"/>few acquaintances and a slender purse, I did not care to taki<lb facs="P16_TL00072"/>in the pleasure places of New York, but became a constan<lb facs="P16_TL00073"/>visitor at my friend's house, and was thrown more and mon<lb facs="P16_TL00074"/>in contact with his sister. Our friendship terminated ii<lb facs="P16_TL00075"/>marriage. Our courtship, which was of a rather length<lb facs="P16_TL00076"/>nature—my wife waiting some four years until I secured m;<lb facs="P16_TL00077"/>degree—was of the conventional kind—books, theatres occasion<lb facs="P16_TL00078"/>ally and flowers.<lb facs="P16_TL00079"/>I recollect what great pleasure I used to derive from putting<lb facs="P16_TL00080"/>pretty inscriptions on the front leaves of the books—a few tende:<lb facs="P16_TL00081"/>lines of some poet or a few touching words in Latin from mj<lb facs="P16_TL00082"/>limited store. I don't know whether I married for love, trui<lb facs="P16_TL00083"/>love, or whether I married because I mistook friendship foi<lb facs="P16_TL00084"/>love. Perhaps the latter. I have three children and earn j<lb facs="P16_TL00085"/>comfortable living. My wife takes life calmly and seems quit<lb facs="P16_TL00086"/>centered on herself. She seems to want to get the most out o<lb facs="P16_TL00087"/>life for herself.<lb facs="P16_TL00088"/>Often I wonder whether I would be happier and more cJJj<lb facs="P16_TL00089"/>tented had I remained single. Married life has become for me<lb facs="P16_TL00090"/>so dull, so monotonous. It lacks the sympathy, the affection anc<lb facs="P16_TL00091"/>co-operation that I fondly looked forward to.</ab>

Their<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>shrill voices were as glad as if their faces had been freshly.<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>washed with morning dew and their ragged raiment made<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>* whole. For, if water be scarce in the quarter, so are<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>mirrors and if one's frock be frayed one has only to hold<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>one's head high above such sartorial shortcomings.<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>"I put my right foot in,<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>I I take my right foot out,<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>I make my foot go tap, tap, tap,<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>And turn myself around."<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>chorused the voices.<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>To be sure the last line didn't rhyme but in New York<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>there is no time for mending rhymes. New ones are born<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>every minute, but no one will stop to learn them as long<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>as the old ones hang together.<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>But the bad rhyme got on Miss West's nerves. The<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>constant repetition jarred like a newly crowned tooth that<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>the dentist has confused with the bill and made too high.<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>"Children, would you like me to tell you a fairy story?"<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>she asked.<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>"Oh, yes, Miss West," they answered politely, "we<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>would like it very much," which was not at all true, but<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>- what they had been taught was expected of them.<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>' "Well, then, once upon a time a fairy came to New<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>York—"<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>"Not to New York!" they exclaimed, laughing de<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

You see, in New York no<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>one believes in fairies because no one ever sees them; and<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>no one ever sees them because no one believes in them.<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>This fairy disguised herself so she wouldn't be recognized<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>by any stranger from the country. She folded up her<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>wings and tucked them into her tailor suit. She did up<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>her hair and hid her fairy wand in an umbrella. She<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>even painted her face so she would look like the rest of<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>her sex. And no one even suspected her."<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>"But, Miss Wild West, why should a fairy come to<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>New York?" they cried in bewilderment.<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>"Ah, you may well ask.

Vaguely they<lb facs="P17_TL00071"/>too understood how she felt. "Did she die?"<lb facs="P17_TL00072"/>"No, just as her heart began to beat so faintly she<lb facs="P17_TL00073"/>thought it was going to stop, she stumbled blindly into<lb facs="P17_TL00074"/>a garret.

That is what I should do with you."<lb facs="P17_TL00086"/>The fairy was so amused she burst right out laughing.<lb facs="P17_TL00087"/>"I was crying because New York is so ugly," she said.<lb facs="P17_TL00088"/>"But now I don't seem to mind so much. I haven't been<lb facs="P17_TL00089"/>amused before but I am beginning to be."<lb facs="P17_TL00090"/>"New York is not ugly," said the spider with emphasis.<lb facs="P17_TL00091"/>"You are a woman and you don't know anything about<lb facs="P17_TL00092"/>it. Women are inferior—"<lb facs="P17_TL00093"/>"You said that before," said the fairy, "and I didn't<lb facs="P17_TL00094"/>believe you then."<lb facs="P17_TL00095"/>"But I can prove it!" shrieked the spider.<lb facs="P17_TL00096"/>"Well, who cares if you can," said the fairy, "I can<lb facs="P17_TL00097"/>prove that you are knock-kneed but I'm too polite."<lb facs="P17_TL00098"/>"I hate politeness," said the spider, spinning another<lb facs="P17_TL00099"/>thread. "Why should we lie to "feach other? But you<lb facs="P17_TL00100"/>are a woman, and women, like all inferiors, lie."<lb facs="P17_TL00101"/>"I heard you the first time," said the fairy.

It is a big piece of sticky<lb facs="P17_TL00106"/>fly paper.

It was then that the fairy made a<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>great discovery. She saw that the spider was not a spider<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>at all, but a big hearted, sympathetic writer man. The<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>reason he looked so black and ugly was because he was<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>all covered over with ink from trying to tell people about<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>the beauty and romance and savor of life which they were<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>overlooking in their mad rush to the grave. The web<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>he was so industriously weaving was made all of silver<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>threads. It glistened in the sunlight with the glint of<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>golden deeds, the sparkle of jewelled hopes and pearls of<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>thought that mark the path of inspiration.<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>"As she gazed, the fairy felt her own tired, crushed<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>wings stir faintly and, adjusting her somewhat battered<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>straw hat at the angle at wrhich she usually wore her</ab>

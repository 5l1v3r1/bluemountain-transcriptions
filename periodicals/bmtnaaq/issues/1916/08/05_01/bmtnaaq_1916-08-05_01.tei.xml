He was the man who had set<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>himself out to ridicule the safe prejudices of that large<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>section of the population of the British Isles, known as<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>the Upper Middle Class.<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>For many years young Shaw struggled for recognition,<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>but he was always looked upon as the brilliant gutter<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>orator, of whom no serious account need be taken.

He is no orator,<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>but he speaks in a clear decisive tone, heard through a<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>large space. He is thoroughly at home on the platform<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>and keenly enjoys the privilege of speaking. His brilliant<lb facs="P7_TL00046"/>wit is plentifully exercised in his speeches, and I suppose,<lb facs="P7_TL00047"/>this accounts for the huge audiences he is able to gather<lb facs="P7_TL00048"/>in any part of England. When speaking to these, even<lb facs="P7_TL00049"/>on the most serious subjects, he is able generally to con<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

She is an authoress and is a translator of<lb facs="P8_TL00077"/>Brieux plays into English. Shaw declares himself to be<lb facs="P8_TL00078"/>his wife's slave. "I have to be," he adds, amid the<lb facs="P8_TL00079"/>laughter, in which his wife joins.<lb facs="P8_TL00080"/>As a dramatist, Shaw has practically created a new<lb facs="P8_TL00081"/>form of playwriting. Whilst he has ignored every canon<lb facs="P8_TL00082"/>of the laws of dramatic technique, he has produced the<lb facs="P8_TL00083"/>most complete and entertaining of plays. His "Man and<lb facs="P8_TL00084"/>Superman" will long live as the comic masterpiece of the<lb facs="P8_TL00085"/>age. Shaw has actually been able to destroy many a<lb facs="P8_TL00086"/>prejudice in good old England. After all there is a good<lb facs="P8_TL00087"/>deal in the strength of powerful ridicule and when it is<lb facs="P8_TL00088"/>delivered with brilliancy and across the open forum of<lb facs="P8_TL00089"/>the stage, it can produce vital effects.<lb facs="P8_TL00090"/>As a Socialist, Bernard Shaw has shown the really<lb facs="P8_TL00091"/>serious side of himself and his contributions to the Fabian<lb facs="P8_TL00092"/>literature are fraught with able and constructive ideas for<lb facs="P8_TL00093"/>a future ideal state. I remember an evening in London<lb facs="P8_TL00094"/>when two of Shaw's plays were running in the capital<lb facs="P8_TL00095"/>and a third was being given its premier performance, yet<lb facs="P8_TL00096"/>Shaw was to be found in his place on the platform at the<lb facs="P8_TL00097"/>fortnightly meeting of the Fabian Society, at which some<lb facs="P8_TL00098"/>intricate idea of Sidney Webb's on Poor Law Reform was<lb facs="P8_TL00099"/>being discussed. Shaw's attitude on Socialism has often<lb facs="P8_TL00100"/>been misunderstood. He is no sentimentalist and feels<lb facs="P8_TL00101"/>that the English working class element are to be scoffed<lb facs="P8_TL00102"/>at for the smallness of their demands, and for their lack<lb facs="P8_TL00103"/>of solidarity. When speaking of the splendid solidarity<lb facs="P8_TL00104"/>existing amongst capitalists, Shaw adds, "I ought to know.<lb facs="P8_TL00105"/>I am a capitalist myself." These jokes make a good deal<lb facs="P8_TL00106"/>of enemies for Shaw. But really, his idea is to put up the<lb facs="P8_TL00107"/>backs of the working classes and get them to realize<lb facs="P8_TL00108"/>what a deadly enemy this system is in which they live<lb facs="P8_TL00109"/>and to which they would dare to become reconciled.<lb facs="P8_TL00110"/>It will be to the credit of Shaw, that he above all other<lb facs="P8_TL00111"/>writers in England to-day. has not lost his head through<lb facs="P8_TL00112"/>the war. His "Common Sense and the War" created a<lb facs="P8_TL00113"/>sensation throughout the world and showed clearly how<lb facs="P8_TL00114"/>"junkerism" of the English and German varieties were<lb facs="P8_TL00115"/>really responsible for this horrible and totally unnecessary<lb facs="P8_TL00116"/>slaughter of the innocents.

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00126"/>tarism was hailed with delight by Englishmen but his<lb facs="P8_TL00127"/>equal denunciation of English navalism as a danger to<lb facs="P8_TL00128"/>the peace of the world, left them strongly resentful. Thus</ab>

Artzibasheff was found, and all the others who<lb facs="P14_TL00067"/>have since come to this country and played their important<lb facs="P14_TL00068"/>part in the literary events of 1915 and 1916.<lb facs="P14_TL00069"/>Thanks to Mr. Alfred A. Knopf, the young publisher<lb facs="P14_TL00070"/>who gave us so many good books during the first year of<lb facs="P14_TL00071"/>his activities in New York, we can shake hands with<lb facs="P14_TL00072"/>Feodor Sologub. Germany had him as far back as 12<lb facs="P14_TL00073"/>years ago. Translations of his fairy tales, of his parables<lb facs="P14_TL00074"/>and of his novels appeared during that memorable period<lb facs="P14_TL00075"/>of the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first<lb facs="P14_TL00076"/>five years of the twentieth century, in German magazines<lb facs="P14_TL00077"/>galore. Collections of these translations were issued in<lb facs="P14_TL00078"/>pamphlet form and in a few slim volumes by reputable<lb facs="P14_TL00079"/>publishers.<lb facs="P14_TL00080"/>It is interesting to note how Russia has communicated<lb facs="P14_TL00081"/>its literature for the past 50 years to the world. Russian<lb facs="P14_TL00082"/>revolutionists always have lived in France and Germany at<lb facs="P14_TL00083"/>close quarters with Slavic revolutionists of Austria. The<lb facs="P14_TL00084"/>facilities for printing and distributing radical literature<lb facs="P14_TL00085"/>were excellent in England, especially in London, that open<lb facs="P14_TL00086"/>port of dissatisfied citizens of all countries. The refugees<lb facs="P14_TL00087"/>translated authors whom they liked into French but much<lb facs="P14_TL00088"/>more into German, the universal language in that hotbed<lb facs="P14_TL00089"/>of Slavic aspirations, Austria-Hungary. Via the German<lb facs="P14_TL00090"/>language they reached England. Not from the original<lb facs="P14_TL00091"/>Russian were most of those translations made which gave<lb facs="P14_TL00092"/>us Russian authors for the first time, but from the French<lb facs="P14_TL00093"/>and in many more cases, from the German.<lb facs="P14_TL00094"/>It would take generally twenty years for the Russian<lb facs="P14_TL00095"/>author, translated for the first time into German, to reach<lb facs="P14_TL00096"/>the friendly shores of America. As an example Sologub<lb facs="P14_TL00097"/>may serve.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P15_TL00003"/>Gogel loved Russia. He loved the Russians with all<lb facs="P15_TL00004"/>their faults and all their weaknesses. He was too much<lb facs="P15_TL00005"/>of a poet and of a dreamer to become a realist and so his<lb facs="P15_TL00006"/>"Dead Souls" was the last word he said to Russia before<lb facs="P15_TL00007"/>he went into exile. There he became a mystic and a<lb facs="P15_TL00008"/>phantast. Some of his storiesâ€”they are not translated<lb facs="P15_TL00009"/>as yet into Englishâ€”remind one of Poe and of that other<lb facs="P15_TL00010"/>unfortunate poet, A. T. Hoffmann. Read the last<lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>sentence in the second volume of his "Dead Souls." In<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>these eight lines he tells you what he wanted, how he loved<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>Russia and how he firmly believes in the progress and the<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>ultimate good fortunes of all its citizens.<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>Sologub is not a satirist. He is not a glowing patriot,<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>who wishes to hold a mirror before the eyes of all the<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>Russians. Sologub lives in a little circle, whose center he<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>is himself. He is a master painter, who loves the detail of<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>the miniature. No matter if he creates a fairy tale of<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>about twenty lines, or a novel of 350 pages: it is a<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>masterpiece as a whole and you can cut out an inch here<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>or a fraction of an inch there and it will remain a master<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

It is you and<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>I whom you see on the pages of Sologub, with all our<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>meanness, with our petty shrewdness, but also with all<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>the heroism which we must have if we don't want to come<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>to grief on our journey to the unknown infinite.<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>I see in"The Little Demon" something different than<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>do its translators.

He had just come to that age where all<lb facs="P15_TL00071"/>normal humming "birds desire to leave the parental nest<lb facs="P15_TL00072"/>and fly forth to see the world.

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00006"/>One night Jean stayed to supper and Mrs. Hupp took<lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>the chair by Martin's elbow and watched her so hard she<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>could not have looked once at her plate. Martin thought<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>he would never have been able to stand her looking at him<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>that way; it would have given him the jim-jams. But<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>Jean just talked and talked. All during the meal his<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>mother kept hitting him on the arm and kicking his foot<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>when he and Jean were talking to each other. She was<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>so clumsy the girl saw it all. Once Mrs. Hupp kicked<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>Jean's foot by mistake. Jean said, "Ouch, somebody<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>kicked me!" The old lady just took off her glasses and<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>looked at Martin hard and said, "Bassoon!" Then Jean<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>began to cry and Martin thought she was putting on. But<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>that was all that was said.<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>The old lady got helpless and Martin had to help her in<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>and out of bed. Jean told him a man could never nurse a<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>sick person and came over to do it herself. The old wo<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>man had to submit, but she talked against it all the time<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>as though it were something that still had to be decided.<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>If Jean made a change in the way of taking something oif<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>her, or did anything unusual, she would push her away<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>with her feeble hands and sometimes slap her. But Mar<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

One day Jean told him he ought to<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>think himself lucky because he had a mother who "was so<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>crazy about him she couldn't look at anybody else." There<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>are some people," she said, "that just sit around all day<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>loving a person and the only time they ever let up loving<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>'em is when they say anything to them." She said his<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>mother was like that. At first he did not believe her, but<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>afterwards he felt like he knew his mother all of a sudden<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>for the first time.<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>The night his mother died, Jean was the first one he<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>wrent to, but he made her bring some of the neighbors in<lb facs="P18_TL00040"/>with her. She said she hated them, they were such old<lb facs="P18_TL00041"/>fools and acted around a dead person like a lot of chickens<lb facs="P18_TL00042"/>over an ear of corn. The first thing she asked him was:<lb facs="P18_TL00043"/>"Have you got enough money to bury her nice?" Martin<lb facs="P18_TL00044"/>held out his hand with such a lot of bills in it as she had<lb facs="P18_TL00045"/>never seen, and she counted two hundred dollars right<lb facs="P18_TL00046"/>away. "She took my head in her hands and said I must<lb facs="P18_TL00047"/>learn to tell the truth and not go through life acting like<lb facs="P18_TL00048"/>a liar, and then she gave it to me," he said.

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00049"/>him Mrs. Hupp had always "had it on her," because she<lb facs="P18_TL00050"/>found it one night when she was undressing her, but the <lb facs="P18_TL00051"/>old womap did not know she knew anything about it. She<lb facs="P18_TL00052"/>said she hoped he would not take on, because it was only<lb facs="P18_TL00053"/>a blessing when people were so old. Martin said: "You<lb facs="P18_TL00054"/>won't come over any more now; nobody will let you." She<lb facs="P18_TL00055"/>just shrugged her shoulders and told him he did not know<lb facs="P18_TL00056"/>much, and if you waited for people to let you do things<lb facs="P18_TL00057"/>you would hold your hands. And she said, "Anyway, it's<lb facs="P18_TL00058"/>no use coming where you're not wanted." Martin told<lb facs="P18_TL00059"/>her to "shut her face."<lb facs="P18_TL00060"/>The funeral was in June. Martin thanked the Lord<lb facs="P18_TL00061"/>when the neighbors stopped visiting. It was queer to be<lb facs="P18_TL00062"/>in the house alone; he thought it must be like that on ship<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00063"/>board. When he was a boy he would have given his right<lb facs="P18_TL00064"/>hand to go to sea. He sat down in his mother's old chair<lb facs="P18_TL00065"/>and tried to cry. He found by feeling sorry foY himself<lb facs="P18_TL00066"/>and praying he could cry some, but not much. He thought<lb facs="P18_TL00067"/>his sorrow hurt him so much he could not act like the<lb facs="P18_TL00068"/>others. He had not seen Jean for two days. He would<lb facs="P18_TL00069"/>have to make up his own bed now and cook his meals.<lb facs="P18_TL00070"/>He was only going to keep the house until the lease ran<lb facs="P18_TL00071"/>out, because it was so cheap. The neighbors thought he<lb facs="P18_TL00072"/>ought to get just a lodging, there were so many nice people<lb facs="P18_TL00073"/>near, and it was indecent for a man to live in a house<lb facs="P18_TL00074"/>alone; though that was according to the man. Martin<lb facs="P18_TL00075"/>could hardly believe that Jean would not come any more.<lb facs="P18_TL00076"/>The next day he would have to go back to work and he<lb facs="P18_TL00077"/>was tired and started to bed about nine o'clock. Jean<lb facs="P18_TL00078"/>came in and saw him undressing. She screamed a little<lb facs="P18_TL00079"/>and sat down in a chair and said: "You ought to be<lb facs="P18_TL00080"/>ashamed of yourselfâ€”so earlyâ€”and I had such a time<lb facs="P18_TL00081"/>coming." Then she turned her back and said: "I won't<lb facs="P18_TL00082"/>look; but put on shirt and you can take me out for a<lb facs="P18_TL00083"/>walk." Martin said it was not so early, it was nine any<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00084"/>way, and laughed and showed her the clock. She just<lb facs="P18_TL00085"/>looked at it and said: "When I look at a clock I always<lb facs="P18_TL00086"/>think it would be better to be dead." Martin was so glad<lb facs="P18_TL00087"/>to see her he did not think about having his shirt off. She<lb facs="P18_TL00088"/>stood up and stamped her foot and said: "This is awful!<lb facs="P18_TL00089"/>I'll go into the next room." He brushed his hair and they<lb facs="P18_TL00090"/>went down the street together, after she went through the<lb facs="P18_TL00091"/>alley by the back way, and met him. "They were all sit<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

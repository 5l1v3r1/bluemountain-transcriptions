                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00083"/>Here is a sample of Crane's prose. It will be seen how<lb facs="P4_TL00084"/>unromantically he viewed life. But he goes as far the<lb facs="P4_TL00085"/>other way. His men are men—mere clay; but he lays<lb facs="P4_TL00086"/>bare their souls—dissects them as does the surgeon:<lb facs="P4_TL00087"/>" . . . . I sat on San Juan hill and watched Lawton's<lb facs="P4_TL00088"/>division come up where I could look into the faces<lb facs="P4_TL00089"/>of men who were trotting up under fire. There wasn't a high,<lb facs="P4_TL00090"/>heroic face among them. They were all men intent on business.<lb facs="P4_TL00091"/>.They were not of our shallow and preposterous fictions.<lb facs="P4_TL00092"/>They stood out in a simply majestic commonplace. It was the<lb facs="P4_TL00093"/>behaviour of men on the street. . . . Each man was just<lb facs="P4_TL00094"/>pegging along at the heels of the man before him, who was<lb facs="P4_TL00095"/>pegging along at the heels of still another man who— It was<lb facs="P4_TL00096"/>that in the flat and obvious way. In another way it was<lb facs="P4_TL00097"/>pageantry, the pageantry of the accomplishment of naked duty.<lb facs="P4_TL00098"/>One cannot speak of it—the spectacle of the common man<lb facs="P4_TL00099"/>serenely doing his work, his appointed work. It is the one<lb facs="P4_TL00100"/>thing in the universe which makes one fling expression to the<lb facs="P4_TL00101"/>winds and be satisfied to simply. feel."<lb facs="P4_TL00102"/>In addition to the books already mentioned, Crane<lb facs="P4_TL00103"/>wrote "Lines" ('95) ; "The Little Regiment," "The<lb facs="P4_TL00104"/>Monster" ('95), and two posthumous works—a novel<lb facs="P4_TL00105"/>"The O'Ruddy," and a sheaf of children's stories. The<lb facs="P4_TL00106"/>author of scarce a dozen books when death cut him off,<lb facs="P4_TL00107"/>had he lived he might have produced "the great American<lb facs="P4_TL00108"/>novel."<lb facs="P4_TL00109"/>Robert Barr, just before Crane's death, thought him<lb facs="P4_TL00110"/>of all living American authors, the only one destined to<lb facs="P4_TL00111"/>this honor. His delicately analytical and, at times, excori-*<lb facs="P4_TL00112"/>atingly penetrating social criticism, coupled with his other<lb facs="P4_TL00113"/>brilliant gifts of style and imagination perhaps well fitted<lb facs="P4_TL00114"/>him for such a magnum opus. But, like Keats, he was<lb facs="P4_TL00115"/>cut off before his time.<lb facs="P4_TL00116"/>How photographically accurate are some of Crane's<lb facs="P4_TL00117"/>characterizations. Here are two the Greenwich Villager<lb facs="P4_TL00118"/>must perforce recognize:<lb facs="P4_TL00119"/>A boy in Rum A'lley was ''throwing stones at howling urchins.<lb facs="P4_TL00120"/>. . . His infantile countenance was livid with fury. His<lb facs="P4_TL00121"/>small body was writhing in the delivery of great crimson oaths.<lb facs="P4_TL00122"/>His features wore the look of a tiny insane demon."</ab>

We indulged in a calmer passion,<lb facs="P11_TL00057"/>less flame writhen though smouldering for aye. Could I<lb facs="P11_TL00058"/>help that ? Forgive me.

Thinkest thou that the world<lb facs="P12_TL00069"/>will hail thee as prophet and succour thee in their innocent<lb facs="P12_TL00070"/>credulity? But go thy way, for thou shalt indeed know<lb facs="P12_TL00071"/>the truth in the end, if to thy enduring folly there be an<lb facs="P12_TL00072"/>end."<lb facs="P12_TL00073"/>And he left her and passed into foreign parts attired<lb facs="P12_TL00074"/>in the simple gray garb of a holy man. And he preached<lb facs="P12_TL00075"/>his word to all that were concerned but his prayer fell as<lb facs="P12_TL00076"/>rain in a sea of dust, for the world had long wearied of<lb facs="P12_TL00077"/>its prophets and their homily of moaning wisdom.<lb facs="P12_TL00078"/>And after a time he came to a land which was riotous<lb facs="P12_TL00079"/>with wickedness, with a vice made gilded and pleasurable<lb facs="P12_TL00080"/>for the inhabitants.<lb facs="P12_TL00081"/>And he said to them, "Why do ye sin?"<lb facs="P12_TL00082"/>And they answered, "Because we fear Death and the<lb facs="P12_TL00083"/>sleep that knoweth no waking. We strive to forget that<lb facs="P12_TL00084"/>our end is night and oblivion."<lb facs="P12_TL00085"/>And he rebuked them sternly, crying, "Alas! for ye.<lb facs="P12_TL00086"/>Know ye not what cometh hereafter? Have ye no fear<lb facs="P12_TL00087"/>of Hell and of eternal torment?"<lb facs="P12_TL00088"/>And they laughed at him, saying, "Not we, nay! Ask<lb facs="P12_TL00089"/>of the subtle and discerning worm which is our uninvited<lb facs="P12_TL00090"/>guest!"<lb facs="P12_TL00091"/>But he was silent and pondered over their intent.<lb facs="P12_TL00092"/>Then they said to him beguilingly, "Come, be one of<lb facs="P12_TL00093"/>us. What profits it that thou waylay palsied old with<lb facs="P12_TL00094"/>thy hoary word of an uncertain god ? Take thee a chaplet<lb facs="P12_TL00095"/>of vine-leaves and a garment of violet cloth. We have<lb facs="P12_TL00096"/>yellow liquor in goblets of scarlet chalcedony and honey<lb facs="P12_TL00097"/>sweeter than was ever fabled of old.

God knows,<lb facs="P12_TL00111"/>which of us will go next, not I!"<lb facs="P12_TL00112"/>And she answered, "Open, for I come in mercy."<lb facs="P12_TL00113"/>And he opened the gates wide to see what manner<lb facs="P12_TL00114"/>of person so dared to brave death.

A<lb facs="P14_TL00081"/>simple pull at the latch string of a big gate brought my steed,<lb facs="P14_TL00082"/>with me atop, into the most wonderful farm yard I have ever<lb facs="P14_TL00083"/>seen.

I instinctively turned around and if I had not<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>recognized her voice, I surely would not have recognized<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>my purple companion of a few minutes ago. She wore<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>a heavy green and red-brown checked ulster and a white<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>veil over a black-sailor hat that made it impossible to<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>recognize her features.

I felt that<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>the one who was uncomfortable and uneasy in this strange<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>situation was not myself, but her. But I did not intend<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>to ask any questions or encourage her in any way to tell<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>me her story. You can't coax a bird to sing.

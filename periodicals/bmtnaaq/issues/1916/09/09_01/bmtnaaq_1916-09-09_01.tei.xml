Roma locuta est. The New York critic is called<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>upon to render a supreme verdict.<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>Incomprehensible! Real critics are becoming scarce<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>in New York. The entente cordiale between business<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>offices of the daily papers and press agents who are<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>giving out the big theatrical advertisements do not seem<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>any longer to permit a critical interloper.

Every college boy who<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>speaks and writes a Broadway slang—if possible, with<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>an Oxford accent—-is gladly accepted as a judge of<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>dramatic art.<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>Dramatic art? She can succeed only in veiy singular<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>cases, putting up a hard fight against the coalition. But<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>otherwise a wonderful harmony is prevailing in the<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>theatrical microcosm of the United States. The<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>provincial managers get the New York verdicts which<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>they wish for and which they deserve. Newspapers are<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>being blessed with columns of the criticisms that they<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>deserve. The public gets just the sort of newspapers<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>that it deserves. It is a circulus vitiosus and the taste<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>of all concerned, verily, will not be improved. The typical<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>product of this depravity is the leg show-euphemistically<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>called musical comedy or even comic opera. Supposedly<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>welcomed by the tired business man, the leg show is<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>undoubtedly the pet child of the commercial manager,<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>of the critic and of the public. That it satisfies the<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>masculine taste—especially of a masculinity tired out<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>by business—can be easily understood. It represents<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>the extremest possible exposition of female charms,<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>permitted by the police only here—outside of certain<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>illegal places of amusement. Also ladies like to visit<lb facs="P10_TL00044"/>these shows, escorted by their men friends ; they are so<lb facs="P10_TL00045"/>animating. Furthermore, women are objects of a<lb facs="P10_TL00046"/>strange worship in these plays. Even in the title, a<lb facs="P10_TL00047"/>girl has to figure. The last one is "The Girl from Brazil"<lb facs="P10_TL00048"/>in the Forty-forth Street Theatre.

Not on account of the music, which was<lb facs="P10_TL00051"/>so little new that whole motifs were lifted from Johann<lb facs="P10_TL00052"/>Strauss's "The Bat" and from Oscar Strauss's "The<lb facs="P10_TL00053"/>Walz' Dream", They appeared like spectres of happy<lb facs="P10_TL00054"/>days that had gone before. The plot was desperately<lb facs="P10_TL00055"/>like other plots of equally low plausibility, which we—<lb facs="P10_TL00056"/>you and I—tried to puzzle out on former occasions.<lb facs="P10_TL00057"/>The principals on the stage showed the average lack of<lb facs="P10_TL00058"/>ability, of temperament, of style. The chorus girls<lb facs="P10_TL00059"/>were not exeptionally beautiful nor had they good voices.<lb facs="P10_TL00060"/>Still, the verdict was unanimous that the show had<lb facs="P10_TL00061"/>"push and go."

                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00079"/>I was a quiet studious little girl when my grandmother<lb facs="P12_TL00080"/>remarked casually to my mother that I was the sort of<lb facs="P12_TL00081"/>girl who would never marry. Mamma was disturbed and<lb facs="P12_TL00082"/>decided to at least give me, the chanpe. Our modest income<lb facs="P12_TL00083"/>was stretched to two new dresses and etcetras, an iniation<lb facs="P12_TL00084"/>fee to an amateur dramatic club, to say nothing of a dance<lb facs="P12_TL00085"/>or two. I had ae clever mother, and half a dozen beaux soon<lb facs="P12_TL00086"/>ensued. I also had a sense of humor and warned them of<lb facs="P12_TL00087"/>mamma's nefarious schemes, which proved to be good<lb facs="P12_TL00088"/>diplomacy, too. Feeling that the mater deserved to prove<lb facs="P12_TL00089"/>her point, I accepted the best of my beaux, a wealthy young<lb facs="P12_TL00090"/>man on the London Stock Exchange, but secretly entered<lb facs="P12_TL00091"/>into a six months contract with him by which hearts and<lb facs="P12_TL00092"/>small sundries were to be returned intact, reasonable wear<lb facs="P12_TL00093"/>and tear excepted, if I failed to fall in love with him. We<lb facs="P12_TL00094"/>renewed that contract for 99 years. But . . .<lb facs="P12_TL00095"/>Well, the Boer War wrecked many fortunes on the Stock<lb facs="P12_TL00096"/>Exchange, including my fiance's. The mater commanded us<lb facs="P12_TL00097"/>to call the marriage off. Then I proved unexpectedly dis<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00098"/>obedient. With nothing but the proceeds of the sale of<lb facs="P12_TL00099"/>jewelry he had given me, we fled from England to California<lb facs="P12_TL00100"/>as man and wife. It was a wonderful adventure, no money*<lb facs="P12_TL00101"/>no friends, not much business ability, but lots of love and<lb facs="P12_TL00102"/>self-confidence. I got a position first, which nearly broke v<lb facs="P12_TL00103"/>my husband's heart. But a bank soon discovered it needed<lb facs="P12_TL00104"/>his Stock Exchange experience and it was not long before we<lb facs="P12_TL00105"/>had our own little home, a baby, a big garden, and many<lb facs="P12_TL00106"/>good friends.<lb facs="P12_TL00107"/>Odd as it may seem, my most poigffant happiness came<lb facs="P12_TL00108"/>wheh my husband developed tuberculosis, when the baby was<lb facs="P12_TL00109"/>a year old. For it gave me such a chance to prove my love.<lb facs="P12_TL00110"/>I was the bread-winner and managed to make good on<lb facs="P12_TL00111"/>a newspaper.

Even as a schoolgirl I had definite dreams of a<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>career. Marriage was mentally relegated to the late twenties.<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>I had always plenty of beaux. There was no hurry. Besides<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>no one of the many male friends who came into my life and<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>passed out again seemed quite to suit. I meant to marry<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>for love pure and simple but there was always some barrier<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>to pervent the incipient grand passion reaching its ultimate<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>climax. The man with the cleanest soul might have the<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>dirtiest finger nails; the most ardent lover, alas, was often<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>also the most comperhensive liar; and the fine Mautz, looking<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>fellow was too frequently supplied with every physiological<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>requisite except brains. Well, the thirties were approaching<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>fast. Lovers were fewer than they had been and no choice<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>had been made. The only apparently perfect man on my<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>horizont was already married. Recklessly I made a vow. "I<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>shall marry the first man who proposes to me/' A week<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>afterwards I met him. Two weeks afterwards our wedding<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>day was fixed. It was,, in all sincerity, the happiest day of<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>my life.

Every person who has any<lb facs="P4_TL00071"/>regard for honest literature should join in the protest. Mr.<lb facs="P4_TL00072"/>Dreiser's book is not immoral in the least.

Mr. Dreiser tried to depict a phase of life<lb facs="P4_TL00084"/>with fidelity to truth and with no purpose to serve evil.

                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00091"/>dom of art cannot be too strong. Literary censorship is an<lb facs="P4_TL00092"/>intolerable institution. It cramps imagination and cripples<lb facs="P4_TL00093"/>invention. It has a paralytic influence upon thought. And<lb facs="P4_TL00094"/>it does not help morals in the least. Indeed, it puts a premium<lb facs="P4_TL00095"/>upon the meanest nastinesses that circulate clandestinely.<lb facs="P4_TL00096"/>The best disinfectant of base art is freedom. "The Genius"<lb facs="P4_TL00097"/>is not a corrupting novel. It is not a nasty novel, though it<lb facs="P4_TL00098"/>has defects of taste. It shows how "genius" is not above<lb facs="P4_TL00099"/>the moral law. The writers and the readers of the country<lb facs="P4_TL00100"/>should not stand for its suppression nor mutilation.</ab>

The chief features of his magazinette were<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>very, very fine satires of prominent New York citizens,<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>especially rich merchants were his prey, names which arc<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>today a vital part of the early history of New York.

After<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>careful deliberation—and perhaps after the money was spent<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>—he came to the conclusion that his promise had been too<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>hasty and that it could not be combined with his dignity as<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>editor.

In a Mexico, that including the<lb facs="P10_TL00047"/>American appearing therein, does not at all exist: just a<lb facs="P10_TL00048"/>miscarriage of Tully's imagination, hopelessly romantic<lb facs="P10_TL00049"/>and hopelessly impossible.

The antithesis of<lb facs="P10_TL00055"/>the palatial living quarters of the master and the kitchen<lb facs="P10_TL00056"/>is designed to create the contrast. It is an excellent<lb facs="P10_TL00057"/>dramatic idea. Herman Sudermann used a similar idea<lb facs="P10_TL00058"/>in his famous "Hbnour," contrasting the front and the<lb facs="P10_TL00059"/>back of the house, but what do the Hatton's get out of<lb facs="P10_TL00060"/>it? A little bit of mischief caused by a very improbable<lb facs="P10_TL00061"/>young girl and a few comic episides, but like Mr.<lb facs="P10_TL00062"/>Mauphan they are masters of a comic dialogue—and<lb facs="P10_TL00063"/>the audience laughs. Good actors like Courtoney Foote,<lb facs="P10_TL00064"/>Fred Tidon and Juliette Day know how to serve theyr<lb facs="P10_TL00065"/>public the dramatic dish. It is only good to look upon,<lb facs="P10_TL00066"/>the audience goes home hungry.<lb facs="P10_TL00067"/>"Polyanna" is a new play at the Hudson. Rather it<lb facs="P10_TL00068"/>is not a play at all, it is a novel. But no one will deny<lb facs="P10_TL00069"/>"Pollyanna" has her charms. Even for one who hasn't<lb facs="P10_TL00070"/>read the "best seller," whence it derives its origin. A<lb facs="P10_TL00071"/>darling child is the heroine and another dear child is one i<lb facs="P10_TL00072"/>of the other actors.

I asked, lighting<lb facs="P10_TL00095"/>a cigarette.<lb facs="P10_TL00096"/>"Yes, I do. Let me tell you this, my friend," he went on,<lb facs="P10_TL00097"/>In his earnest, impulsive way, which was wont to become a<lb facs="P10_TL00098"/>little wearisome: "You know that I'm not much better than<lb facs="P10_TL00099"/>a pauper. Well! I'm sick of slaving away for a wretched,<lb facs="P10_TL00100"/>paltry salary, and I'm going to end it all. I've thought about</ab>

Now don't<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>be afraid. Go in a big department store. Go at first to<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>the transfer department and have them give you a<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>transfer slip. Then go to the trunk department and buy<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>a big, heavy trunk.

                                    <lb facs="P13_TL00065"/>not exist in marriage, because love is an ideal, that is to say,<lb facs="P13_TL00066"/>something not quite understood—transparencies, color, light,<lb facs="P13_TL00067"/>a sense of the unreal.,, And she who is now my wife and I<lb facs="P13_TL00068"/>both agreed: "Love—yes, but not marriage." Pure Platonic<lb facs="P13_TL00069"/>love it was at first—the glorious joy of companionship—<lb facs="P13_TL00070"/>two young hearts thrilling together in the mutual appreciation<lb facs="P13_TL00071"/>of all things glad and beautiful. What had we to do with the<lb facs="P13_TL00072"/>world? We were content. Our love was ours to do with as<lb facs="P13_TL00073"/>we wished.<lb facs="P13_TL00074"/>But love grows as a speed, when planted in rich and fertile<lb facs="P13_TL00075"/>soil. From the love of companionship grew the love of<lb facs="P13_TL00076"/>protection, that which is akin to paternal love—the desire of<lb facs="P13_TL00077"/>the one to do those little things which make life easier and<lb facs="P13_TL00078"/>sweeter for the other. Happiness increased with the in<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P13_TL00079"/>creasing knowledge of each other. Next desire came, un<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P13_TL00080"/>bidden, and we knew that sexual love was born, that love<lb facs="P13_TL00081"/>which is the crowning glory in the spiritual relations of all<lb facs="P13_TL00082"/>humanity. Was it fear which awakened in us the thought<lb facs="P13_TL00083"/>of the marriage ceremony—the wish to protect each other<lb facs="P13_TL00084"/>from the sharp stings of malicious ever-wagging human<lb facs="P13_TL00085"/>tongues? The easiest way was the conventional way—no<lb facs="P13_TL00086"/>questions would be asked, and the respective families,<lb facs="P13_TL00087"/>hitherto not considered, would be conciliated. "Blessings<lb facs="P13_TL00088"/>upon thee, my children," fervently uttered by a generation<lb facs="P13_TL00089"/>with standards different from our own, might mean a certain<lb facs="P13_TL00090"/>satisfaction when we, too, grew old. Marriage is beautiful,<lb facs="P13_TL00091"/>is as in the quatrain by Richard Le Gallienne:<lb facs="P13_TL00092"/>"Like to the intertwisted melody<lb facs="P13_TL00093"/>Of harp and lute shall our true wedding be<lb facs="P13_TL00094"/>And such a marriage of fair music make<lb facs="P13_TL00095"/>That none shall separate the Thee from Me."<lb facs="P13_TL00096"/>If there is music, what matters it if it be played on a<lb facs="P13_TL00097"/>church organ or on a figurative, and more poetic, harp and<lb facs="P13_TL00098"/>lute? Yes, we had our reasons when armed with a license<lb facs="P13_TL00099"/>and a gold band ring we entered the Church. And who can<lb facs="P13_TL00100"/>say there is not a thrill in hearing pronounced: "Those whom<lb facs="P13_TL00101"/>God hath joined together let no man put asunder." Today<lb facs="P13_TL00102"/>we proudly say that that queer little imp call Regret has<lb facs="P13_TL00103"/>never crossed our threshold.</ab>

Turning<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>the golden lock with a silver key, she drew forth between<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>her snow-white fingers a rope of pearls measuring its length<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>thrice around her slender throat.<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>"My pearls," she said, _ "my beautiful thought pearls,<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>strung in the shadowed solitude of night, I shall wear you<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>for him, my Prince, when he comes.

There in her garden she espied a young gardener<lb facs="P7_TL00054"/>turning the moist earth with a heavy spade.<lb facs="P7_TL00055"/>"What do you plant, young gardener?" she said, and he*<lb facs="P7_TL00056"/>looking up in amazement to behold the pale Princess stand<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00057"/>ing beside him, answered,—"I plant lilies, Your Grace, early<lb facs="P7_TL00058"/>lilies."<lb facs="P7_TL00059"/>When he looked up at her with great large dark eyes,,<lb facs="P7_TL00060"/>filled with an eloquence of innocence and youth, simple<lb facs="P7_TL00061"/>living and unpretentious bravery and undaunted manhood,<lb facs="P7_TL00062"/>her own eyes filled suddenly with tears, her lips trembled*<lb facs="P7_TL00063"/>her cheeks turned whiter than the lily bloom, for she knew<lb facs="P7_TL00064"/>him—the face she had woven, the face she had dreamed,<lb facs="P7_TL00065"/>her Prince in the face of a gardener.

Green moss clung to his<lb facs="P7_TL00071"/>garments, drops of the gentle dew of evening glistened in<lb facs="P7_TL00072"/>his dark hair.

The young gardener fell upon his knees,<lb facs="P7_TL00075"/>thinking indeed a Saint had fallen from heaven, so beautiful<lb facs="P7_TL00076"/>was she, with such a strange light within her eyes, and over<lb facs="P7_TL00077"/>her the moonbeems gleamed as upon a shrine.<lb facs="P7_TL00078"/>"Oh, most lovely one, most glorious one, you honor my<lb facs="P7_TL00079"/>humbleness so to bless my vision. My children shall know112<lb facs="P7_TL00080"/>of this, and my childrens' children, and I shall be great in<lb facs="P7_TL00081"/>the eyes of them that come after me for the sake of your<lb facs="P7_TL00082"/>goodness."<lb facs="P7_TL00083"/>"Your children," said the Princess, and she sighed a sigh<lb facs="P7_TL00084"/>that sounded like diying winds of the bleak Autumn, winds<lb facs="P7_TL00085"/>that sing at the tops of pine trees.<lb facs="P7_TL00086"/>"I hope," said the gardener, much embarrassed and<lb facs="P7_TL00087"/>abashed, "for, Your Highness, I marry in June a little maiden<lb facs="P7_TL00088"/>in your service, a little maiden ..."<lb facs="P7_TL00089"/>Enough" said the Princess,'"Give this to your happy<lb facs="P7_TL00090"/>bride from me." And she took from her finger the red ruby<lb facs="P7_TL00091"/>of her heart's desire.<lb facs="P7_TL00092"/>Day by day the Princess weaves her tapestries; gay ladies<lb facs="P7_TL00093"/>and brave gentlemen; brooks and streams; sunlight and<lb facs="P7_TL00094"/>stars; but never at the head of the procession is seen the<lb facs="P7_TL00095"/>portrait of the young Prince on the wihte charger in full<lb facs="P7_TL00096"/>armour. Yet, even as the sunlight changes into dusk she<lb facs="P7_TL00097"/>weaves in the gold of its last fading ray the portrait of the<lb facs="P7_TL00098"/>young gardener bending over a bed of young lilies. At<lb facs="P7_TL00099"/>night when the moon is shining into the casement of the<lb facs="P7_TL00100"/>tower, it touches a little silver key around the thoat of The<lb facs="P7_TL00101"/>Princess, hung there by a golden chain. The carven casket<lb facs="P7_TL00102"/>of jewels is unopened, the lock is rusted, and the Princess<lb facs="P7_TL00103"/>dreams over and over only of the gardener and the gardner's<lb facs="P7_TL00104"/>children.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00003"/>I want you to help me do it. We were at a reception<lb facs="P12_TL00004"/>to-night. I bade father and mother goodj-night. They<lb facs="P12_TL00005"/>thought I was going upstairs to retire. Nobody saw me<lb facs="P12_TL00006"/>slip out of the house.

All I am concerned<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>about at present is to avoid being detected and brought<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>back to my home. You will understand easily why I<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>don't want you to see my face or know my name. My<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>disappearance from my, home will be noticed in the<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>morning. At first they will try to locate me quietly.<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>They naturally will not succeed. So they will have to<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>turn to the police and it won't be long until the papers<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>will be filled with the mysterious disappearance of one<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>of New York's heiresses. If you never saw my face and<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>1 didn't tell you my name, you can never be blamed and<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>can even declare on oath that you didn't know me, and<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>never saw me. Now tell me again that you will have<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>the courage to help me. You don't want me to mention<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>money but I have all my jewelry with me which is at<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>least twenty-five thousand dollars worth, and I took it<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>from home just for the one purpose, to give it to the<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>man who is going to help me create my new life. Will<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>you be this man?"<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>I reassured her and then I said, "I will have a cup of<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>coffee and then I am going to leave you. You'll have<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>to make yourself comfortable as well as you can. Did<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>you leave a message for your parents? They will be<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>terribly frightened in the morning when they discover<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>your absence. Did you think of that?"<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>She said she had left a note explaining what she had<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>intended to do and I believe she was sincere in her<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>regret to cause me all that trouble. But she seemed<lb facs="P12_TL00043"/>mightily relieved to know that I would leave her sole<lb facs="P12_TL00044"/>mistress of the apartment for the remainder of the night.<lb facs="P12_TL00045"/>I drank a cup of coffee, showed her to her bedroom,<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>instructed her to let the water run for a while if she<lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>wanted a cold drink, and made myself ready to leave.<lb facs="P12_TL00048"/>"Now, if you'll give me twenty-five cents, I shall send<lb facs="P12_TL00049"/>you up some breakfast to-morrow morning. I wish I<lb facs="P12_TL00050"/>could extend real hospitality to you but I told you, I<lb facs="P12_TL00051"/>haven't got a penny to my name, and so you'll have to<lb facs="P12_TL00052"/>pay your own board."<lb facs="P12_TL00053"/>We shook hands, I left the apartment.<lb facs="P12_TL00054"/>I had lied when I said I would put up with a friend.<lb facs="P12_TL00055"/>I had a lot of acquaintances but was not intimate enough<lb facs="P12_TL00056"/>with anybody to bring him out of bed at two o'clock in<lb facs="P12_TL00057"/>the morning and ask for a night's lodging. And so I<lb facs="P12_TL00058"/>strolled down towards Washington Square, picked out a<lb facs="P12_TL00059"/>bench far away from the electric light, in a dark corner,<lb facs="P12_TL00060"/>and settled myself comfortably for the night.<lb facs="P12_TL00061"/>The poor thing!

I thought of all<lb facs="P12_TL00073"/>that had happened since I left the club. What did she<lb facs="P12_TL00074"/>say?

Why had I refused to<lb facs="P12_TL00077"/>execute the arch of the bridge? Because it was against<lb facs="P12_TL00078"/>my pride to commercialize my art. Commercialize my<lb facs="P12_TL00079"/>art? I thought of the millions that perhaps would delight<lb facs="P12_TL00080"/>to look at it, and I thought of the man whose name it<lb facs="P12_TL00081"/>would bear and to whose memory it was to be erected:<lb facs="P12_TL00082"/>and they told me that there was a lot of more work in the<lb facs="P12_TL00083"/>future to be done for the public and to be paid for by the<lb facs="P12_TL00084"/>public. Of course, I had other plans for the future. But<lb facs="P12_TL00085"/>was I justified to live a life such as I had done until<lb facs="P12_TL00086"/>now? Just working at what I pleased to and whenever<lb facs="P12_TL00087"/>I pleased to. Finding a Macaenas once in awhile and<lb facs="P12_TL00088"/>living regularly on credit.

It was almost seven<lb facs="P12_TL00099"/>o'clock as I left the building to go back to my apartment.<lb facs="P12_TL00100"/>I felt happy and gay as I hadn't felt for a long while.<lb facs="P12_TL00101"/>I stopped in at a little lunch room on Sixth Avenue<lb facs="P12_TL00102"/>wiiere I was known and had them put a twenty-five cent<lb facs="P12_TL00103"/>breakfast on a tray, cover it up with a napkin, and I<lb facs="P12_TL00104"/>carried it upstairs to my apartment. I rang my own bell<lb facs="P12_TL00105"/>and my guest opened. She wore one of my pajama<lb facs="P12_TL00106"/>suits, my bathrobe and a black veil over her face. She<lb facs="P12_TL00107"/>assured-me she had slept as fine as never before in her<lb facs="P12_TL00108"/>life and was very, very hungry.<lb facs="P12_TL00109"/>I repaired to the bathroom and proposed to her to take<lb facs="P12_TL00110"/>breakfast while I was taking a morning plunge and<lb facs="P12_TL00111"/>changing my clothes.<lb facs="P12_TL00112"/>She really had eaten all that was on the plates.

I imagined<lb facs="P13_TL00054"/>all sorts of things especially as he had immediately taken<lb facs="P13_TL00055"/>possession and was at that moment sitting in the parlor.<lb facs="P13_TL00056"/>It being cold I went into see the fire and incidently look<lb facs="P13_TL00057"/>our new lodger over. Judge my surprise to see him sitting<lb facs="P13_TL00058"/>before an easel sketching a portrait of a lady. Oh an artist;<lb facs="P13_TL00059"/>"Yes when trade is dull." For he was a house-painter as<lb facs="P13_TL00060"/>well. Is don't know where my manners were as I forgot to</ab>

I don't think he noticed<lb facs="P13_TL00063"/>or had any manners himself just then for he asked me to play<lb facs="P13_TL00064"/>something for him saying he was very fond of music. As I<lb facs="P13_TL00065"/>opened the piano he placed the maiden's prayer before me.<lb facs="P13_TL00066"/>I played it through; when finishing he thanked me, excusing:<lb facs="P13_TL00067"/>himself he retired to his room taking his easel with him. I<lb facs="P13_TL00068"/>was astonished at his abruptness, I told Mother she surely<lb facs="P13_TL00069"/>had a lunatic for a lodger. We did not see him again for<lb facs="P13_TL00070"/>several days. Not until Mother asked him for the room rent<lb facs="P13_TL00071"/>at the expiration of the week. He looked so pale and when<lb facs="P13_TL00072"/>Mother asked if he were ill he said no rather curtly that he<lb facs="P13_TL00073"/>was working hard to get his picture finished as it would be<lb facs="P13_TL00074"/>done in a few days would she wait? Of course she would<lb facs="P13_TL00075"/>wait, as we were just going to have supper would he not<lb facs="P13_TL00076"/>join us. After a little persuasion he said just a cup of tea<lb facs="P13_TL00077"/>if we did not mind as he was cold. As we surmised he was<lb facs="P13_TL00078"/>down in Lard street we prevailed upon him to eat some<lb facs="P13_TL00079"/>supper. I then suggested he use the parlor where it was<lb facs="P13_TL00080"/>warmer than his room to complete his work. That we would<lb facs="P13_TL00081"/>not disturb him. Of course it was only sympathy for a poor<lb facs="P13_TL00082"/>old fellow down on his luck. Thanksgiving-day came he did<lb facs="P13_TL00083"/>not leave his room. When dinner was ready I asked him to<lb facs="P13_TL00084"/>join us, after some persuasion he came. After dinner I<lb facs="P13_TL00085"/>played again for him. He brought out his violin and played.<lb facs="P13_TL00086"/>The next day his picture was finished. He paid Mother for<lb facs="P13_TL00087"/>one month in advance and became a regular boarder. After<lb facs="P13_TL00088"/>which we spent many pleasant evenings sometimes home.<lb facs="P13_TL00089"/>Oftimes a concert, the theatre or church. Christmas we were<lb facs="P13_TL00090"/>engaged to be married but said nothing to my family. In<lb facs="P13_TL00091"/>May one Sunday at supper our boarder suggested he and I<lb facs="P13_TL00092"/>take a car ride. We stopped at a parsonage and were married;<lb facs="P13_TL00093"/>by a Methodist minister. When we entered the parsonage<lb facs="P13_TL00094"/>the moon was shining brightly, when we came out the rain<lb facs="P13_TL00095"/>was coming down in torrents. My husband borrowed &lt;m&gt;<lb facs="P13_TL00096"/>umbrella. When we reached home Mother scolded fearing;<lb facs="P13_TL00097"/>my new dress and hat had been ruined. My husband laughed<lb facs="P13_TL00098"/>saying he guessed he could replace them if spoiled. Poor<lb facs="P13_TL00099"/>old Mother became furious, she felt insulted. "Never mind<lb facs="P13_TL00100"/>Mother, don't be angry I married Lizzie to-night to keep her<lb facs="P13_TL00101"/>from being a fussy old maid. Introducing me as his wife<lb facs="P13_TL00102"/>he handed her the marriage certificate to read as proof. Now<lb facs="P13_TL00103"/>at the age of 62 I am toiling for my living.

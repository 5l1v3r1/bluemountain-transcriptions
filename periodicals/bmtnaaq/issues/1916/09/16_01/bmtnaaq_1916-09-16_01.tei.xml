It is essentially and fundamentally American.<lb facs="P3_TL00012"/>It stimulates and exhilarates one like an old wine.

Prior to this I had<lb facs="P3_TL00019"/>taken our ragtime pretty much for granted. I have<lb facs="P3_TL00020"/>always been in love with this sort of melody. In the<lb facs="P3_TL00021"/>early years, when my juvenile ears were incapable of<lb facs="P3_TL00022"/>discriminating or analyzing, I knew the "hits."

Her vitality is that of the prairie<lb facs="P3_TL00031"/>mare, only a few months in harness. Lover of primal<lb facs="P3_TL00032"/>things that she is, the call of the wild is never without<lb facs="P3_TL00033"/>its appeal to her. The sky she loves, the sea she loves,<lb facs="P3_TL00034"/>the mountains she loves, the valleys she loves. All that<lb facs="P3_TL00035"/>is big and strong is America. And America is all that<lb facs="P3_TL00036"/>is big and strong.<lb facs="P3_TL00037"/>Even in her most effete Eastern cities, the cowboy is<lb facs="P3_TL00038"/>her hero. The spirit of the Grand Canyon rules the<lb facs="P3_TL00039"/>continent. Big surroundings breed big thoughts.<lb facs="P3_TL00040"/>America is the offspring of her prairies, her towering<lb facs="P3_TL00041"/>Rockies, her vast lakes. Ever in the midst of such<lb facs="P3_TL00042"/>elemental splendor could she be other than inspired?<lb facs="P3_TL00043"/>And could her inspiration find expression in anything<lb facs="P3_TL00044"/>but magnificent thought? Walt. Whitman's poetry is as<lb facs="P3_TL00045"/>much America as Yellowstone Park. It is but the cold<lb facs="P3_TL00046"/>majesty of the mountain ridges, the terrible splendor of<lb facs="P3_TL00047"/>the gulfs, the barren magnificence of the plains—melted<lb facs="P3_TL00048"/>into words.<lb facs="P3_TL00049"/>In the earlier years America found herself elementally<lb facs="P3_TL00050"/>provided with the lovelier things. In the thunder of her<lb facs="P3_TL00051"/>great waterfalls was music that quickened and inspired.<lb facs="P3_TL00052"/>In her California sunsets were color pictures of power<lb facs="P3_TL00053"/>and vitality. Mountains shaped like human heads were<lb facs="P3_TL00054"/>her sculpture. And through the pulsing, naturalness of<lb facs="P3_TL00055"/>it all, surged a poetry, more august, vivid and lyrical<lb facs="P3_TL00056"/>than has ever welled up from the heart of earthly bard.<lb facs="P3_TL00057"/>We still have all these treasures, today. The waterfalls<lb facs="P3_TL00058"/>retain their lovely cadence. The sunsets are as rich in<lb facs="P3_TL00059"/>tones, as delightfully variable, as ever.

If she<lb facs="P4_TL00082"/>appeared to be indifferent, he made signs that she would<lb facs="P4_TL00083"/>be very welcome. At last she approached him, very<lb facs="P4_TL00084"/>shyly. But the nearer she came to him, the more<lb facs="P4_TL00085"/>animated she grew and soon had progressed as far as<lb facs="P4_TL00086"/>a great crust of bread that lay between them.

They<lb facs="P4_TL00095"/>had often sat on a perch there together and he had talked<lb facs="P4_TL00096"/>about love and had stroked her wing feathers with his<lb facs="P4_TL00097"/>bill, very tenderly. And she had made no objections.<lb facs="P4_TL00098"/>She knew they had fallen in love with each other and<lb facs="P4_TL00099"/>that each was thinking of building a nest. Both wanted<lb facs="P4_TL00100"/>to set up house-keeping right there where they had<lb facs="P4_TL00101"/>acknowledged their love and had such happy times.<lb facs="P4_TL00102"/>The ardent lover grew more and more determined.<lb facs="P4_TL00103"/>He took hold of the crust and jerked it here and there<lb facs="P4_TL00104"/>so vigorously that he raised a little storm of crumbs and<lb facs="P4_TL00105"/>dust.<lb facs="P4_TL00106"/>"How strong he is," thought the little lady. And she<lb facs="P4_TL00107"/>noticed with satisfaction that the performance was being<lb facs="P4_TL00108"/>watched by other feathered folk. What she really wanted<lb facs="P4_TL00109"/>to do was to hop up to him—quite close to him—and<lb facs="P4_TL00110"/>lay her head on the white spot on his breast.

                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00112"/>one could see it.

So they decided<lb facs="P5_TL00081"/>to build themselves a nest.<lb facs="P5_TL00082"/>"I remember how my mother was accustomed to speak<lb facs="P5_TL00083"/>of it. Each piece of reed that they fetched in their bills<lb facs="P5_TL00084"/>was admired and then laid carefully in just the right<lb facs="P5_TL00085"/>place. And when everything was ready father dove deep<lb facs="P5_TL00086"/>in the lake—and that was at the risk of his life for he<lb facs="P5_TL00087"/>had to make the plunge headfirst—and tore away a whole<lb facs="P5_TL00088"/>bushel of seaweed and lined the nest with it to make a<lb facs="P5_TL00089"/>soft bed for my mother. And then they moved in there<lb facs="P5_TL00090"/>and were happy! During the day they romped in the<lb facs="P5_TL00091"/>water and scurried about for food, sharing the tidbit.<lb facs="P5_TL00092"/>Sometimes father had bad luck and then mother was<lb facs="P5_TL00093"/>very proud to be able to give him something from her<lb facs="P5_TL00094"/>store or her catch.<lb facs="P5_TL00095"/>"And then mother had to remain at home and father<lb facs="P5_TL00096"/>always kept coming with something good in his bill.<lb facs="P5_TL00097"/>And then I was born. And how both of them caressed<lb facs="P5_TL00098"/>me and how proud mother and father were?"<lb facs="P5_TL00099"/>Tears stood in the eyes of the old pelican and ran in<lb facs="P5_TL00100"/>great drops down to the yellow sand. He could not speak<lb facs="P5_TL00101"/>for a while, he was so deeply moved.<lb facs="P5_TL00102"/>"And one day,"he continued, a soft sob choking his<lb facs="P5_TL00103"/>voice, "I was separated from my parents and my home.<lb facs="P5_TL00104"/>The sun was bright in the sky, the air was clear and<lb facs="P5_TL00105"/>fresh and the lake lay peaceful there as smooth as glass<lb facs="P5_TL00106"/>and glittering silver like a mirror.

Then suddenly I saw some<lb facs="P6_TL00005"/>great thin thing coming toward me. I did not know at<lb facs="P6_TL00006"/>that time that there were such things as men that were<lb facs="P6_TL00007"/>mightier than we and that could catch us. Father and<lb facs="P6_TL00008"/>mother had not explained that to me, doubtless out of a<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>desire to preserve my childish innocence. Suddenly<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>however I felt myself violently seized from behindhand<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>I lost consciousness.<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>"When I came to myself I was in a little cage and<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>later they brought me here. That was years ago and I<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>have continued to remain here and grown accustomed<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>to everything and only on days like this when the sun is<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>hidden by clouds and I know that it is shining away off<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>there on my meadows and on my lake I find myself very<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>homesick.<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>"It is true that I have everything that I need. I do<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>not have to think of food. I do not have to battle with<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>the wild elements and have nothing to fear from the<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>raging storms. But my wings are lame and my eyes are<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>weak and I would prefer to be one of the little sparrows<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>that come here to steal the crumbs."<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>The pelican stood there pensive. He slowly stretched<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>out his leg that had been drawn up and pointed his "bill<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>in the opposite direction.<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>"But, Mr. Pelican," answered the little gray bird who<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>had listened eagerly to the recital, "why couldn't we<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>build up a nest even here? Haven't you Mrs. Pelican?<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>And think of the beautiful little pelicans that you had<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>last summer and that were taken away!"<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>"Yes, we can build nests. We have to build nests"<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>the pelican said over his shoulder in a bitter tone. "Even<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>you will build one. And they will bring you a mate and<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>you must suffer it—do you hear? you must suffer it! And<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>when you have children they will let you keep them<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>while they are little and helpless and then they will take<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>them from you and use them for other purposes."<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>The pelican walked solemnly over to the other side<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>of the birdhouse where his wife was lying and fell<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>asleep.<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>The gray bird had grown very serious. He looked up<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>at the iron meshes of the cage. He thought of the little<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>sparrow that was building a nest somewhere and he<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>wondered what the little mate that they were going to<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>bring to him would look like. Then he felt a sharp pain<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>—the anguish of a longing that he had never before<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>experienced. He felt disgust and loathing for the puddle<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>of water and yellow gravel and the pelican and the other<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>birds that lived in the house with him. And he wanted<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>to go away. Far away where there were soft grasses<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>and broad lakes and where the water was clear and<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>where the sky was not parcelled off by iron netting. He<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>wanted to fly and to bathe in a lake and to dive into<lb facs="P6_TL00056"/>deep water, headfirst and to tear away seaweed and<lb facs="P6_TL00057"/>he wanted to build a nest.<lb facs="P6_TL00058"/>Summoning all his strength, he lifted himself as high<lb facs="P6_TL00059"/>as possible. He was frightened when he felt himself<lb facs="P6_TL00060"/>hovering uncertainly in the air and striking against the<lb facs="P6_TL00061"/>iron meshes of the birdhouse. "Sometime I am going<lb facs="P6_TL00062"/>to beat against the iron barriers with such force," he<lb facs="P6_TL00063"/>determined, "that they will break and I shall fly away."<lb facs="P6_TL00064"/>And he made this decision after he had flown to the top</ab>

He was Cobb.<lb facs="P7_TL00053"/>But now the munitions are running short; the speed<lb facs="P7_TL00054"/>is gone, the curves no longer break.

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00003"/>Thtf New English Art Club was indeed in doubt for a while<lb facs="P6_TL00004"/>if it should give a winter exhibition. It has done so, but<lb facs="P6_TL00005"/>there is little to comment on in the result. Mr. Augustus John,<lb facs="P6_TL00006"/>the most brilliant figure of this Club, shows some Irish peasant<lb facs="P6_TL00007"/>types drawn with the reality of which he is a master and<lb facs="P6_TL00008"/>not a little of his on-creCping mannerism.<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>The London group is generally the most revolutionary of the<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>art exhibitions. Futurism and Vorticism are usually in violent<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>activity there, but this session neither Mr. Epstein nor Mr.<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>Wyndham Lewis—two of the most interesting figurefs of the<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>advance guard— have sent anything. The Neo-Realists, Gilman,<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>Ginner, Bevan and company, maintain a steady average of<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>honest effort. They are Essentially honest painters, these three,<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>well mannered, industrious and not without talent. They still<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>hold their Saturday afternoon salon up in Cumberland Market,<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>a beautiful old London haymarket, full of light and the<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>atmosphere of early Victorian days. Two or three yefars ago<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>some painters discovered its charm and its good light, and<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>began to colonize in the queer old rickety houses.<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>I looked into the Poetry Bookshop in Devonshire Street the<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>other day and great activity was evident. The public in London<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>really buys a lot of poetry at Christmas and the New Year.<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>It has a preference for something exquisitely bound and printed,<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>but the cheaper little books sell well too, as Christmas or<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>New Year cards. This house has just issued two chap books,<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>Images, by Richard Aldington and Cadences, by F. S. Flint.<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>They contain some charming line's. Both volumes I believe<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>are being published shortly in the States.<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>I should like to call the attention of your readers to A. E.'s<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>Imaginations and Reveries (Maunsel s|-). A. E. (George? W.<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>Russel) js well known of course as one' of the men who<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>brought about the wonderful Irish Literary movement which<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>is undoubtedly the most important literary development that<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>has taken place in these isles for a long time. Justice has<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>perhaps never been done to A. E. Purposely he has kept<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>himself in the background, happy enough to be able to work<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>for his ideal which has been to breathe a new soul into his<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>beloved country. It is only now beginning to be generally<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>recognized what Yeats, A. E., Lady Gregory, Synge1 and all<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>the abbey theatre group have done not only for Ireland, but<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>even for England. They have provided that tradition, that<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>sense of co-operation and security which alone makes a national<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>art possible. They have shown the writers of young Ireland<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>that the best way to serve themselves is to serve something<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>greater than themselves—an ideal.<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>Imaginations and Reveries is a fine book, finer perhaps in its<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>details than as a whole, and I know that a book of such<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>character could not possibly have come out of England.

                                    <lb facs="P10_TL00003"/>aga was a learned man who knew well the laws of his country<lb facs="P10_TL00004"/>and who even had learned how to write. Therefore, he<lb facs="P10_TL00005"/>wrote with his left hand to the! pasha of his district, claiming<lb facs="P10_TL00006"/>to be an invalid and entitled to the pensions granted by the<lb facs="P10_TL00007"/>government. The pasha decided in his favor, but because<lb facs="P10_TL00008"/>he had directed his claims directly to him and not to the<lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>effendi, he had the aga punished with twenty lashes on his<lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>soles. The aga received the twenty lashes and then entered a<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>complaint to the ceraskier, who commissioned the military kadi<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>with the investigation of the case. The* ceraskier found among<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>old laws and codices that only he can be a soldier of the sultan<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>who is in full possession of his right hand, and he also found<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>a military law according to which soldiers could write to thdr<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>superiors, using their right hand only. The aga putin as<lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>defense that he was not a soldier any longer at the time he<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>lost his right hand. The wise kadi was of the opinion that the<lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>aga had been a soldier until dismissed by his bey, no matter<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>whether he was in possession of his right hand or not; and<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>therefore, he! should have written to the pasha with his right<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>hand. After careful deliberation he arrived at the decision that<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>the aga who, while being a soldier had written with his left<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>hand to a superior officer, should be punished ve'ry severely.<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>His left hand should be cut off. Such was the verdict of the<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>military kadi and he added: "Allah knows better."<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>The grand sultan said, after having been informed of the<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>verdict pronounced by the) kadi: "By the beard of the prophet,<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>only a moslem can be a righteous judge."</ab>

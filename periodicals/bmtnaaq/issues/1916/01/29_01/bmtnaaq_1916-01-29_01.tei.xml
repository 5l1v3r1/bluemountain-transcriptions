I paid a visit to the Irish poet, Joseph Campbell, who<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>lives out at Enniskerry, in the Wicklow hills. Going down in<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>the train from Harcourt Street station, I looked at Synge's,<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>In Wicklow and West Kerry. It was in Wicklow that the<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>author of the Playboy picked up so much of that picturesque<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>mixture of folk-lore, racy idiom and incident which make the<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>quality of his comedies. "A great country for tramps," he says,<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>and for tinkers. The abundance of these folk has often been<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>regretted, yet in one sense it is an interesting sign, for wher<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

I could<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>picture to myself how he did it, and when we passed one old<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>fellow, whose face suggested a wealth of racy reminiscences by<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>its character and quaintness I said; "Now if we were Synge<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>we would stand that old fellow a drink and draw him out."<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>"And well amused he would keep us, too," my friend replied.<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>Passing through this Wicklow country revealed Synge to me<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>in a new way. I saw how lonely and miserable the poor fellow<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>must have been in spite of all the glamor and courage he has<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>put into his pages.<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>Campbell is well known in America, I fancy, as the author of<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>Irishry, the Gilly of Christ, The Man Child, etc., and many<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>lyrics in Miss Harriet Monroe's Poetry. He is one of the most<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>vigorous figures of the younger Irish school, and has added his<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>name to the list of authors who have written plays for the cele<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>brated Abbey Theatre'. Campbell feels strongly on the subject<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>of the modern Irish theatre. He told me he believed that one<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>might say that the Abbey, considered as an art theatre, was dead.<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>It has worked out its ideal and there was no fresh one arising.<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>The plays that are produced there now are only comedies or<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>satires. It is true that they are given in rather a better spirit<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>than at the ordinary commercial theatre, but that is all. Of all<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>the plays produced there, only those by Yeats and Synge will<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>last. The point that Campbell particularly made was that what<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>Ireland wanted at present most of all in her theatre was the<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>drama of beauty. And that of course is very true, not only of<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>Ireland, but of any country. Slightly pessimistic as such inti<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>firmed my views. There were two pieces—The Suburban Groove,<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>by W. F. Casey, a young man I remember meeting in London<lb facs="P6_TL00056"/>some years ago, and a new playlet, Fraternity, by Bernard Duffy.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00003"/>One has heard so much of the Abbey Theatre—it is a little<lb facs="P7_TL00004"/>Bayreuth oi modern English theatrical art—that to visit it fof<lb facs="P7_TL00005"/>the first time is quite exciting. It was once! a court-house of<lb facs="P7_TL00006"/>some kind, my friend tells me, and the interior of the building<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>preserves still a little of the judicial sternness. It is very severe?;<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>the proscenium admirable in black and gold lines against a dull<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>white. A few bronze escutcheons rise in high relief from the<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>walls. It is all ve'ry simple and unpretentious. The audience<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>contains a much greater proportion of young men than one<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>would find at any time in a London theatre?. Obviously, theatre<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>going is differently regarded here. The seats are very cheap and<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>we sit in the cheapest—my companion, a young Irish painter,<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>and myself.<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>The Suburban Grooves proves charming. It is a volatile trifle,<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>a comedy of suburban manners, delicately written and delicately<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>acted and admirably true to life. Yet it would not stand a chance<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>at the commercial theatre. It would be too simple, too natural.<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>The whole! play has nothing remarkable about it except that fact<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>that it is a genuine little play, written for the love of the thing,<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>by a whole man who had not sold himself to the devil. The<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>novelty of the evening proved to be very amusing, too. It was<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>a satire on the? Ancient Order of Hibernians. To judge by the<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>comments around me it did not seem to please the audience verv<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>much.<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>To turn to English hews, Thomas Beecham has been made a<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>knight and Henry James has been givCn the Order of Merit.<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>Decorations are always showered in England at the New Year<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>upon a number of people who have spent the previous twelve<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>months, or longer, deserving them. Sir Thomas Beecham has<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>done a good deal for music in England if not for English music.<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>Indeed, his work has been chiefly in connection with Russian<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>opera and ballet. The name Beecham is closely connected with<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>those delightful evenings we used to spend in the great gallery<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>of Covent Garden or Drury Lane a couple of years ago. That<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>was the full flowering of an art-form which a year or so earlier<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>in the less gross atmosphere of Paris had blossomed most per<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>fectly. Behind all fantasy and luxuriance! were the hard<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>lives and the little realized ideals of the Russian composers<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>Mousorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakoff and the brethren of the famous<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>Band. They dreamed their dream of a Russian national music<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>in St. Petersburg about 1860, and about fifty years later their<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>art expanded to its fullest. By the way, an excellent little book<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>on modern Russian music appeared here some short time ago<lb facs="P7_TL00046"/>by Montagu-Nathan. Lane, I think, is the publisher.</ab>

If it is a clear night and there<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>is a moon and the lion is standing on a rock that looks out<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>over a valley, the sounds will go several miles before they stop.<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>The reason he can roar loud is that his neck is big and his<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>vocal cords are strong and his chest powerful.

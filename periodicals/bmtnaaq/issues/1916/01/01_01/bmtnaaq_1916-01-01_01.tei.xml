Some few of the! more wide-awake of these<lb facs="P4_TL00013"/>retired country folk had got hold, it was found, of a rumor<lb facs="P4_TL00014"/>to the effect that the New Netherland, having been traded away<lb facs="P4_TL00015"/>for Surinam by the provisions of the Treaty of Breda, had<lb facs="P4_TL00016"/>become a dependency of the British crown; but the rumor never<lb facs="P4_TL00017"/>had been traced to an authoritative source, and was regarded<lb facs="P4_TL00018"/>by the older and more conservative of the inhabitants of Tenafly<lb facs="P4_TL00019"/>and Schraalenburg and Kinderkamack, and the towns thereto<lb facs="P4_TL00020"/>adjacent, as mere idle talk.

In the year 1728 Captain Warren<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>was on the American station in the Solebay, frigate; probably<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>was here again in 1737; and certainly was here from about<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>1741 until 1746 in the Squirrel, sloop, the Launceston, frigate<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>and the 60-gun ship Superbe.

I. had to wait<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>at the gate. A woman in front of me had pushed a five dollar<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>bill through the wicket. She waited for her change. She<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>received four bills and ninety-five cents in small change.<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>Without recounting, she slipped the money into her black plush<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>handbag.<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>I was traveling to the room of a friend of mine—one of<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>the few I knew in the big city.

No one would notice it and she would<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>forget the bag. I would then move hurriedly to her seat, get<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>it and leave the train instantly. No one would know!

To say that a<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>soldier is adequately provided for is a vain boast; he is just<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>housed, fed in a manner suitable only to men in the best of<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>health, and but roughly equipped. The State thinks it does well<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>by him in providing him with tobacco and free postage, privileges<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>by which all men do not profit equally.

That sentiments of patriotism, the<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>glorification of heroism, and scenes of destruction can be<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>illustrated nobly has been proved by Paul Iribe's idealistic and<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>Masereel's realistic interpretations. But official influence is all<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>powerful just now, and, as the late Jean Dolent, Carriere's<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>friend, said: "Official art has this peculiarity, that it is not<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>art."

                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00006"/>"Mistaken! I was mistaken, Kenneth. Mistaken like years<lb facs="P17_TL00007"/>ago. But it is more dreadful because I have waited so long<lb facs="P17_TL00008"/>and I thought I had found at last just the one that was made for<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>me in the beginning. Did you know that I have been in<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>Michigan? I had to go to a little city. There was no railroad<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>connection and I had to take the boat. I went down in the<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>morning. It was a rainy, ugly day. I had to drive for miles<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>over muddy, sad-looking roads and I was glad when I returned<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>to the pier at an e'arlier hour than I expected. It was on a<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>Sunday. Thousands of men and women had spent the day far<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>from their small and sticky dwellings in Chicago and were tired<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>after the day of excitement. They were ready to go back to<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>their work and face the struggle for daily bread anew and count<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>the days until the next Sunday holiday which they were? plan<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>ning. I had boarded the boat with hundreds of them. They<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>were dining in the dining-room and sitting in the parlors and<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>occupying the chairs on the decks. I hate large gatherings of<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>people belonging to different classes and callings in life. I felt<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>alone and unhappy and wished to be somewhere where I would<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>be spared listening to their chatter, their laughing and the dis<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>tasteful familiarity of young men and young women who<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>thought that they loved one another.<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>"So I went up on the top deck. The wind was blowing, the<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>outline of the little place where I got aboard was vanishing with<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>every turn of the wheel. It was in the late afternoon and the<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>sun had draped himself in his night attire, with those beautiful<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>rays, purple and yellow, which makes such a saddening picture<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>and moves the lonely man to think of the vanity of the! world—<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>if he only cares to concentrate his mind and think.<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>"I was standing on the boat near the captain's bridge and I<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>was looking at those gray, placid waves and the sun which was<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>soon to disappear; and I could not account for that tired, lonely<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>feding which came over me. My eyes ached looking at the<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>sun-ball. I turned around to look for a quiet place where I<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>could sit and await our arrival in Chicago. A young woman<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>was standing opposite me. Our eyes met.<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>"Then—l do not remember exactly—but there was something<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>I did for her. I think I offered her a chair, something of the<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>kind. Some peculiar desire to be near her made me stay up<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>there in the wind. I walked back and forth. I forgot to go<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>down to the dining-room as I had intended to do after all the<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>other diners had left. And finally I discovered a chair, just<lb facs="P17_TL00048"/>vacated by a stout old lady, for whom the breezes had become<lb facs="P17_TL00049"/>too cold, and I carried it near hers and sat down. Again I<lb facs="P17_TL00050"/>looked out toward the sea. The twilight had settled heavily<lb facs="P17_TL00051"/>and the pale moon could be seen if one looked long and sharply<lb facs="P17_TL00052"/>towards the grayish skies.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00003"/>"I turned to her and looked her straight in the face. I<lb facs="P18_TL00004"/>looke'd into her big blue eyes. She gazed at me. I don't know<lb facs="P18_TL00005"/>why but I simply had to speak to her. 'My name is Courtland,'<lb facs="P18_TL00006"/>I said. 'Wont you please talk to me?? Tell me your first<lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>name.' She did not hesitate a second. A very quiet melodious<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>voice said, 'I am Maude. Why are you here on this steamer?'<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>"And we talked, and we talked until the darkness had settled.<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>It was night. A million stars, clearly shining, glittering, hiding<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>themsdves behind clouds, and appearing again. The moon rose<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>higher and higher on its nightly travel. We didn't know that<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>all the other people who had been on deck had gone below to<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>their staterooms. It seemed to me? as if I had found the only<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>other being besides myself occupying this world, seeing with<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>the eyes with which I see, talking with the voice and answering<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>in the most sympathetic voice I had ever heard in my life the<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>thoughts that I could never have spoken in words.<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>"What did we? talk about?

She told<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>me about the picture she wanted to paint, perhaps in years,<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>after she had achieved what she wanted to achieve—a picture<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>which would be so true, so pure? and so beautiful that a mother<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>would put it in the trunk of her departing daughter, the lover<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>give it to his bride as the most precious gift and the bad man,<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>should he stop and glance at it, would stop and look again and<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>remember his mother; a picture? which would be reproduced in<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>millions of copies to be hung in the homes of the wealthy and<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>in the small huts of the poor and in the cell of the man who<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>serves a life sente?nce.<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>"And I told her about myself and about my connections with<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>the world; how I was disappointed in everything which I had<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>done for my own sake and successful in all those things I un<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Will the poet, the man of insight and of prophecy,<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>kindly come? forth and discover her to the world and to herself?<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>There are many interesting phases in Newark's life and in its<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>celebration. All are within the field of the inspiration of the<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>poet we are seeking. To make our volume interesting, its<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>verses should touch on a wide range of subjects. The wits<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>as well as the philosophers have their opportunity here. We<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>think our city already quite? worthy! Now we seek a poet who<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>shall make us famous! If with him comes one who makes us<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>ludicrous—and he does it well—to him also we can award a<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>prize!</ab>

I don't want to know your last<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>name and don't you ever ask me mine. And now, here's my bag<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>gage check. Please assist me in getting off the steamer and<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>then promise! not to look when I go.'<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>"That night I went home and prayed fervently that it might<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>rain the? next day. I felt like a young boy. I have hated the<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>name of Maude as long as I can remember. When a little boy,<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>I once had a governess—the most dreadful old maid you can<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>imagine. Her name was Maude—and she knew how to make<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>me perfectly unhappy. That night I started to love that name.<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>I acted very silly. I was thinking of all the things I wanted to<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>show her, that I wanted to talk to her about and I awoke the<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>next morning and glorious sunshine poured into the room. When<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>I raised the curtain, I felt dreadfully unhappy.<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>"I performed my duties as usual that day but everything<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>seemed to carry a greater happiness, the day was brighter,<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>after I remembered the cheerful and original remarks Maude<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>had made about my work the previous day.<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>"I had a very important appointment for two o'clock in the<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>afternoon. I arranged to have it postponed. It was the finest<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>day you could imagine. There were no signs of coming rain.<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>But I believed with all my heart that there would be a rain<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>because I could not grasp the thought that I should never<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>see! her again. And as there was no rain, but shine, I went<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>up anyhow. I entered the store and there she was. She seemed<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>embarrassed for a second. I could not make out why. Because<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>I had come in spite of the sunshine? Or because she was<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>there herself?<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>" 'I just dropped into telephone and have purchased a slug,'<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>she said, 'but I don't care to phone now,' and she showed me<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>the slug to show me there was no other purpose in her entering<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>the store. And I thought, 'how silly,' and took the slug out of<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>her hand and put it in my pocket. I wanted to keep it. I like<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>little things with a lot of memories attached to them. I am<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>still keeping it in my pocket now.<lb facs="P17_TL00048"/>"That was yesterday, Kenneth, and you don't know how<lb facs="P17_TL00049"/>charming she was, and how I felt the more that she was the<lb facs="P17_TL00050"/>woman made for me. Made for me so that we could perfect one<lb facs="P17_TL00051"/>another! And again we parted, not knowing who we really<lb facs="P17_TL00052"/>were.

He can breathe<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>any way he wants to but knows it is better to breathe through<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>his nose so he does. He lets the air come in and go out just<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>as it will. And if he wants to feel real pleased, he sings to<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>himself. How he does it is to raise his soft palate and keep<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>it raised so that the' air in passing by it will make it vibrate.<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>When the palate! vibrates it makes vibrations in the air all<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>around the cat and anybody who is close enough can hear them.<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>The same air each time is used twice: it makes vibrations<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>as it goes in and it makes more as it comes out.

Almost literarily<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>they are sold by weight. They are very expensive and solid,<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>and are bought by thousands. A notable book though shows<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>its head here and there'. Such an one is the translation of<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>Romain Rolland's Au Dessus de la Melee, which is to be given<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>the title of 'Above the Battle' and is published by Allen &amp;<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>Unwin.

The<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>publication in France of Au Dessus de la Melee was for some<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>time forbidden by the French Government. It is not easy to<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>see why, here in England, whe're we still enjoy a greater<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>liberty of expression than they do in France. Any of these<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>articles of Rolland's might have been published in any paper<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>here at any time during the war, for the' patriotism which<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>inspires them is undoubted, and it is only a plea for reason<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>and the intelligence which the author of Jean Christophe offers<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>us in these beautiful pages.

Then it is that village of<lb facs="P10_TL00008"/>which you read, the background to so many big things, the<lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>essential in so many big lives,—the one? part of the city where<lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>you can forget city and six million co-inhabitants of yours:<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>there is the Arch with its simple architecture, the monumental<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>gateway to the Square, between the nake'd branches of trees<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>and bushes,_ houses big and small, with large windows and just<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>stingy openings to let in the light.

And then you cross over to the othefr side<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>of the Square and there are the small narrow streets. The<lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>Square is deserted and only a few passengers waiting for<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>the next bus make up the small group beneath the arc light.

The halls of the big building resounded with<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>the footsteps of the two late visitors. Only a few electric<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>lights shone mistily in the corridors.

One of the<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>nurses came out. She whispered for a few minutes with, the<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>Doctor. Courtland's face was rigid. A severe sternness had<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>settle'd on his forehead. His eyes were hard as Kenneth had<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>never seen them before.

He went into his own den.<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>Contrary to his custom he turned on the big candelabra in<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>die middle of the ceiling. He turned on the lights on the walls<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>and turned on the different lamps on the tables and on the<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>mantel. "I want light, Kenneth," he said, "light and truth are<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>friends.

                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>hardt has been at the Coliseum this week with her voice—still<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>marvellous to say, not without magic—and—poor thing!—her<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>artificial limb. She recited Les Cathidrales, sitting in a great<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>throne-like chair the while, and then acted in Du Theatre au<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>Champ d' Honneur, a little war piece. The latter was rather<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>dreadful, but the Coliseum audience, one of the stupidest and<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>most sentimental in London, was apparently enthralled.<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>At the Shaftesbury Theatre we have had another interesting<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>though not quite successful entertainment this week. It is<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>another case of a musician endeavoring to digest a literary<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>masterpiece much in the way that Liza Lehmann did with<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>Everyman, as I mentioned in my last letter. This time it is<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>Sir Charles Stanford who has endeavored to turn Sheridan's<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>Critic into a kind of music play or comedy with music.. The<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>result is not spontaneously successful. Sir Charles has no very<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>light gift of musical humour and some of his musical jokes are<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>very heavy indeed. The composer has mixed original music<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>with parodies of Wagner, Strauss, Debussy and the old style<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>of Italian opera like Trovatore. Sheridan is good and Sir<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>Charles Stanford is good in his own way as a composer of<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>light academic work and a professor of distinction, but the<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>combination is unsatisfactory.<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>Quite a number of French and Belgian books and reviews<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>continue to be printed and published in England. The Paris<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>firm of Figuiere has a printing works at Cardiff—"The Welsh<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>Outlook Press." There is a company of publishers in London,<lb facs="P12_TL00043"/>issuing new novels and other books in French, in the ordinary<lb facs="P12_TL00044"/>French format with yellow paper covers. Belgian and French<lb facs="P12_TL00045"/>novelists in veile issue their works in this way. Et jai vouler<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>la Paix, by Andre Spire, is just published by the Egoist. Spire,<lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>who has passed most of the time since the outbreak of the war<lb facs="P12_TL00048"/>in Nancy, close to the firing line, has been recently engaged in<lb facs="P12_TL00049"/>buying leather for the French Government, and a little while<lb facs="P12_TL00050"/>ago paid a business visit to London. I did not see him, but he<lb facs="P12_TL00051"/>was taken to the Cafe Royal, I believe, to meet the poets and<lb facs="P12_TL00052"/>painters, and now, chiefly through the instrumentality of my<lb facs="P12_TL00053"/>friend, Richard Aldington, I fancy, we have this little volume of<lb facs="P12_TL00054"/>verse. The following is taken from a poem called Images,<lb facs="P12_TL00055"/>written at Nancy in September, 1914.</ab>

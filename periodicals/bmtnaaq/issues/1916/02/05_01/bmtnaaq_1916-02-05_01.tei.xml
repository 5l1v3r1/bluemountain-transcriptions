He at once<lb facs="P3_TL00017"/>admitte'd me, leaving Generals, Senators and others waiting.<lb facs="P3_TL00018"/>I asked him if there was not some way X could serve my<lb facs="P3_TL00019"/>country more. "Well, my boy, you are serving your country<lb facs="P3_TL00020"/>by being wounded. However, I am glad you want to serve<lb facs="P3_TL00021"/>your country more."<lb facs="P3_TL00022"/>He' was reading a letter as I entered. He looked at me over<lb facs="P3_TL00023"/>his spectacles, then lifting them above his eyes on his forehead,<lb facs="P3_TL00024"/>he looked at me searchingly, as if looking for my wound. Then<lb facs="P3_TL00025"/>he took off his glasses and laid them on the? table. I remember<lb facs="P3_TL00026"/>it was a long table piled with maps and books. He arose and<lb facs="P3_TL00027"/>walked slowly around to where I stood—no longer with fear,<lb facs="P3_TL00028"/>but as if I had met my best friend. He put his hand on my<lb facs="P3_TL00029"/>shoulder. "And you would like? to go back to the front? But<lb facs="P3_TL00030"/>you are too badly wounded for that! Wait a little. Go back<lb facs="P3_TL00031"/>home and get well and strong. We are thinking of organizing<lb facs="P3_TL00032"/>an Invalid Corps to displace able men now on guard duty, and<lb facs="P3_TL00033"/>when we are ready for wounded recruits, send in your name and<lb facs="P3_TL00034"/>you shall do more duty for your Country!"

                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00003"/>where and when I was wounded. "Oh, yes, these bad bulls that<lb facs="P4_TL00004"/>ran, but the" last was not so mad-bad as the first." He then<lb facs="P4_TL00005"/>asked me about the management of the second Bull Run battle.<lb facs="P4_TL00006"/>I told him I felt my commander, McDowell, had been sacrificed<lb facs="P4_TL00007"/>by the jealousy of othe'r generals. And I had the pleasure of<lb facs="P4_TL00008"/>entertaining him quite a little, while the great men waited<lb facs="P4_TL00009"/>in the lobby. This illustrates the great good feeling of the man<lb facs="P4_TL00010"/>who gathered his wisdom from the lowly multitude.<lb facs="P4_TL00011"/>And I, today, remember as if it were but yesterday, that<lb facs="P4_TL00012"/>benevolent face and the great hand that encompassed mine as<lb facs="P4_TL00013"/>he said, "My dear boy, don't forget to send in your name for<lb facs="P4_TL00014"/>the Invalid Corps. God bless you, good-bye!"<lb facs="P4_TL00015"/>I sent in my name promptly and was promptly appointed<lb facs="P4_TL00016"/>Second Lieutenant and ordered to Providence, R. 1., where I<lb facs="P4_TL00017"/>was again mustered into, the United States service, and from<lb facs="P4_TL00018"/>there ordered to Washington, appointed to First Lieutenant<lb facs="P4_TL00019"/>and placed in command of the 4th Company of this new<lb facs="P4_TL00020"/>corps, doing guard duty in the vicinity of the White House.<lb facs="P4_TL00021"/>And then I saw considerable of Lincoln until promoted to<lb facs="P4_TL00022"/>Captain and ordered with my company to this city to guard<lb facs="P4_TL00023"/>criminals. And then and here came the saddest duty of my<lb facs="P4_TL00024"/>life —to guard all that was mortal of the immortal man while<lb facs="P4_TL00025"/>he lay instate at the City Hall for the weeping multitude<lb facs="P4_TL00026"/>to gaze upon. Little thought I when I saw his face in life that<lb facs="P4_TL00027"/>I should so soon be called to guard his face in death. And<lb facs="P4_TL00028"/>now, at seventy-seve?n, I am devotedly trying to recall that<lb facs="P4_TL00029"/>sublime face, that the people may see it as I saw it then in<lb facs="P4_TL00030"/>life. And I have no help but my memory, for his face has<lb facs="P4_TL00031"/>been commercialized by artist and artisan until it has become<lb facs="P4_TL00032"/>a caricature, rather than a character. Even a death-mask has<lb facs="P4_TL00033"/>been produced to villify his gentle face in death; and one<lb facs="P4_TL00034"/>purporting to be a life cast leaving the* mole off! If it had<lb facs="P4_TL00035"/>been from life, Robert T. Lincoln would have never written<lb facs="P4_TL00036"/>me: "As to a cast, I have none and have never wanted one, I<lb facs="P4_TL00037"/>don't like them." And God save the* mark! our halls and our<lb facs="P4_TL00038"/>parks are filled with Lincolns that never were.<lb facs="P4_TL00039"/>This is a gullible age! But there is a time coming when<lb facs="P4_TL00040"/>the idealism of Lincoln will go into effect and nature will<lb facs="P4_TL00041"/>have her own in art as we'll as in life.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00003"/>'"Reading most of the articles for preparedness you'd think<lb facs="P5_TL00004"/>it is going to be an easy thing to get prepared. But don't you<lb facs="P5_TL00005"/>believe it. First, it's easy to say 'Let us have a standing army<lb facs="P5_TL00006"/>of 500,000.' But where are we' to get that many men? The<lb facs="P5_TL00007"/>army _ cannot be kept up to its present complement of men.<lb facs="P5_TL00008"/>Americans won't enlist in numbers, save in hard times, and the<lb facs="P5_TL00009"/>record of annual desertions is depressing. Well then, "Let<lb facs="P5_TL00010"/>us have the Government take over the militia of the states."<lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>But the consent of the individual states must be? secured, and<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>that is not going to be easy. The states will not want to bear<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>the expense and give the Government control. 'Let us adopt the<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>Swiss system, then.' Here, again is a difficulty. The Swiss<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>system begins with training in the schools. The states support<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>the schools. They won't want to pay their money to educate<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>soldiers. Later it will take' men from their work. They will<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>have to be paid for their time. Who will pay, the states or<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>the United States? Suppose we go to conscription. The<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>people will not stand for that. The National Government cannot<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>quickly do much of anything without co-operation of the states<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>and that co-operation will involve' changes in the National<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>Constitution. Secretary of War Garrison makes all these points<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>clear, and the main point is that with regard to the military<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>system there is no unity of authority, responsibility and control.<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>Secretary Garrison plans a small regular army and a con<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The continental army is<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>to be "recruited territorially," say 333 each year from each of<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>the 400 Congressional districts.

A ve!ry peculiar one. _He<lb facs="P7_TL00005"/>decided to become a criminal. Not a very desperate criminal,<lb facs="P7_TL00006"/>but still one whom they would lock up. And if his betrothed<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>would have only the slightest inkling of a conscience and<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>recognize! that it was she who had caused his downfall, her<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>tortures would be terrible. At the same time he to<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>combine the pleasant with the useful and to have as good a time<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>as he could. Therefore he chose! the profession of a crook and<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>started upon hlis new activities by entering an automobile factory,<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>He said: "My name is Rich, formerly day laborer. I wish<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>to get an autombile with as many horsepower as you can put<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>in it." .<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>"Just as you please," replied the! very polite salesman, Do<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>you wish to pay in cash for it?"<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>"Not right now," replied Mr. Rich frankly. "At first I would<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>wish to get it on credit. I just happen to be out of work, you<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>know."<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>The polite salesman was very sorry not to be able to oblige<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>Mr. Rich and advised him to go to the competitor across the<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>street. He followed the advice" but here, too, they did not<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>seem to be very eager to count him among their customers.<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>Everybody simply refused to trust. This astounded Mr. Rich.<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>He always had heard and read how easy it was to get cre'dit,<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>and still two people had refused already to sell him an auto<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>mobile. But this could not discourage him. He went to a<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>bank. He introduced himself as Mr. Rich, day laborer, and<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>asked for a loan of ten thousand dollars. But here?, too, the<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>result of his expedition was very sad. The manager of the<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>bank gave him even a lackey who should show Mm out of the<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>building. But that was all he was willing to give him.<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>In the meantime, his monthly room rent became due. Mr.<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>Rich was not able to pay and informed Mrs. Mclntyre, the<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>keeper of his boarding house, to that effect. He assured her<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>at the same time1, that he was willing to take from now on<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>in addition to the breakfasts included in his rental, dinner and<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>supper with her. Mrs. Mclntyre didn't se'em to approve of this<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>new business arrangement.<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>"The divil glit ye!" did he scream at the top of her voice,<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>"Do yez think Oim crazy?" and she! gave him a push and down<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>the stairs he wefnt. All four flights at once. His possessions<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>she forwarded to the sidewalk where he had landed, through<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>the window.<lb facs="P7_TL00046"/>"It's just my luck," he philosophized. And now it become<lb facs="P7_TL00047"/>most urgent to turn some trick or another .because' his thirst<lb facs="P7_TL00048"/>for revenge was diminishing from day today.<lb facs="P7_TL00049"/>His last recourse was the cook. These beings are supposed<lb facs="P7_TL00050"/>to have savings. He wanted to get a hold of thehn, promise<lb facs="P7_TL00051"/>marriage, he wanted to have a good time and then he wanted<lb facs="P7_TL00052"/>to welcome his fate no matter what might come. But nothing<lb facs="P7_TL00053"/>came. Mr. Rich, day laborer, rCmalined an honest man. Even<lb facs="P7_TL00054"/>the cooks wouldn't give him anything. And so he was at the<lb facs="P7_TL00055"/>end of his wits. He knew nothing more! To take away the</ab>

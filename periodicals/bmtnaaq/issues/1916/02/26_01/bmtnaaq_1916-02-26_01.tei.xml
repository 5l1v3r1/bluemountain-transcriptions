                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00026"/>fore, there will be nothing startling and unusual used in the<lb facs="P4_TL00027"/>theatre of the Bruno Players. No luxurious equipment for<lb facs="P4_TL00028"/>the audience. No new color schemes, no unexpected effects<lb facs="P4_TL00029"/>or revolutionizing stage features, no architecture, producing<lb facs="P4_TL00030"/>optical illusicns on the stage. It will be a show house in<lb facs="P4_TL00031"/>the realest sense of the word. A house where something<lb facs="P4_TL00032"/>is shown.<lb facs="P4_TL00033"/>T'he things which are put on show being the only reason<lb facs="P4_TL00034"/>for the existence of the house, and its main and sole feature.<lb facs="P4_TL00035"/>Only with physical comfort is the human mind susceptible<lb facs="P4_TL00036"/>to new impressions, ready to listen, to like or dislike, to<lb facs="P4_TL00037"/>approve of or to reject. An unprejudiced mind must be<lb facs="P4_TL00038"/>housed in a comfortable-feeling, self-unconscious body.<lb facs="P4_TL00039"/>Therefore, comfortable armchairs are provided with plenty<lb facs="P4_TL00040"/>of room to the right and to the left, to enable one to change<lb facs="P4_TL00041"/>one's position easily, and plenty of space between rows, so<lb facs="P4_TL00042"/>that the legs do not feel stepmotherly treated.<lb facs="P4_TL00043"/>The stage is simple. Just an elevation, with no other<lb facs="P4_TL00044"/>purpose than to expose the performers conspicuously to<lb facs="P4_TL00045"/>everybody present. ACTING IS GOOD AS THE RESULT<lb facs="P4_TL00046"/>OF BEING ITSELF. Therefore, stage settings of more<lb facs="P4_TL00047"/>or less conspicuous designs, decorations of all kinds, the<lb facs="P4_TL00048"/>appliance of the science of stage lighting are only irritating<lb facs="P4_TL00049"/>and distractive to the attention.</ab>

The whole Faubourg, even the ancient folk<lb facs="P7_TL00071"/>who had not felt a street under them for years, turned out<lb facs="P7_TL00072"/>and stood gaping at the house with amazement and loud<lb facs="P7_TL00073"/>conjecture. For why should Gustave Herbout, of all men,<lb facs="P7_TL00074"/>take to the rope? Only last week he had inherited all the<lb facs="P7_TL00075"/>money of his aunt, Madame Jahn, together with her house<lb facs="P7_TL00076"/>and the shop with the five assistants, and life looked fair<lb facs="P7_TL00077"/>enough for him. No; clearly it was not wise of Gustave to<lb facs="P7_TL00078"/>hang himself!<lb facs="P7_TL00079"/>Besides, his aunt's death had happened at a time when<lb facs="P7_TL00080"/>Gustave was in sore straits for money. To be sure, he had<lb facs="P7_TL00081"/>his salary from the bank in which he worked; but what is a<lb facs="P7_TL00082"/>mere salary to one who (like Gustave) threw off the clerkly<lb facs="P7_TL00083"/>habit when working hours were over, to assume the dress<lb facs="P7_TL00084"/>and lounge of the accustomed boulevardier: while he would<lb facs="P7_TL00085"/>relate 4o obsequious friends vague but satisfactory stories of<lb facs="P7_TL00086"/>a Russian Prince who was his uncle, and of an extremely<lb facs="P7_TL00087"/>rich English lady to whose death he looked forward with<lb facs="P7_TL00088"/>hope. Alas! with a clerk's salary one cannot make much of<lb facs="P7_TL00089"/>a figure in Paris. It took all of that, and more, to maintain<lb facs="P7_TL00090"/>the renown he had gained amongst his acquaintance of hav<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

So he was forced to depend on the presents<lb facs="P7_TL00093"/>which Madame Jahn gave him from to time to time; and for<lb facs="P7_TL00094"/>those presents he had to pay his aunt a most sedulous and<lb facs="P7_TL00095"/>irksome attention. At times, when he was almost sick from<lb facs="P7_TL00096"/>his craving for the boulevard, the cafe, the theatre, he would<lb facs="P7_TL00097"/>have to repair, as the day grew to an end, to our Faubourg,<lb facs="P7_TL00098"/>and the house behind the shop, where he would sit to an old<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Punctually at nine o'clock the deaf<lb facs="P7_TL00103"/>servant, who was the only person besides Madame Jahn that<lb facs="P7_TL00104"/>lived in the house, would let in the fat old priest, who cams<lb facs="P7_TL00105"/>for his game of dominoes, and betake herself to bed. Then<lb facs="P7_TL00106"/>the dominoes would begin, and with them the old man's<lb facs="P7_TL00107"/>prattle, which Gustave knew so well: about his daily work,<lb facs="P7_TL00108"/>about the uselessness of all things here on earth, and the<lb facs="P7_TL00109"/>happiness and glory of the Kingdom of Heaven: and, of<lb facs="P7_TL00110"/>course, our boulevardier noticed, with the usual cheap sneer<lb facs="P7_TL00111"/>of the modern, that whilst the priest talked of the Kingdom<lb facs="P7_TL00112"/>of Heaven, he yet shewed the greatest anxiety if he had<lb facs="P7_TL00113"/>symptoms of a cold, or any other petty malady. However,<lb facs="P7_TL00114"/>Gustave would sit there, with a hypocrite's grin and inwardly<lb facs="P7_TL00115"/>raging, till the clock chimed eleven. At that hour Madame<lb facs="P7_TL00116"/>Jahn would rise, and, if she was pleased with her nephew,<lb facs="P7_TL00117"/>would go over to her writing-desk and give him, with a rather</ab>

The money, indeed, was a<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>kind of consolation; but then there were nights when he did<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>not get a sou.

Further, the little Mademoiselle, with yellow hair,<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>had lately shewn signs of a very pretty temper, because her<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>usual flowers and bon-bons were not apparent. So, since<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>things were come to this dismal pass, Gustave fell to attend<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

During the first week<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>Gustave won largely, for that is sometimes the way with<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>ignorant men: during that week, too, the little Mademoiselle<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>was charming, for she -had her bouquets and boxes of bon<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>bons. But the next week Gustave lost heavily, for that is<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>also very often the way with ignorant men: and he was<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>thrown into the blackest despair, when one night at a place<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>where he was used to sup, Mademoiselle took the arm of a<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>great fellow, whom he much suspected to be a German, and<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>tossed him a little scornful nod, as she went off.<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>On the evening after this had happened, he was standing,<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>between five and six o'clock, in the Place de la Madeleine,<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>blowing on his fingers and trying to plan his next move, when<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>he heard his name called by a familiar voice, and turned to<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>face his aunt's adviser, the priest.<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>"Ah!

"And are you going to your good aunt to-night?"<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>he added, with a look at Gustave's neat dress.<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>Gustave was in a flame that the priest should have detected<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>him in his gay clothes, for he always made a point of appear<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

You see I'm<lb facs="P8_TL00048"/>a little behind with my office-work, and I have to stay at home<lb facs="P8_TL00049"/>and catch up."<lb facs="P8_TL00050"/>"Well! well!" said the priest, with half a sigh, "I suppose<lb facs="P8_TL00051"/>young men will always be the same. I myself can only be<lb facs="P8_TL00052"/>with her till nine o'clock to-night, because I must see a sick<lb facs="P8_TL00053"/>parishioner. But let me give you one bit of advice, my<lb facs="P8_TL00054"/>friend," he went on, taking hold of a button on Gustave's<lb facs="P8_TL00055"/>coat: "don't neglect your aunt; for, mark my words, one day<lb facs="P8_TL00056"/>everything of Madame Jahn's will be yours!"

Yes; it was certain that the house, and the shop with<lb facs="P8_TL00061"/>the five assistants, would one day be his; for the priest knew<lb facs="P8_TL00062"/>all his aunt's affairs.

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00065"/>meanwhile, what about the numerous bills; what (above all!)<lb facs="P8_TL00066"/>about the little4ady with yellow hair? He paused and struck<lb facs="P8_TL00067"/>his heel on the pavement with such force, that two men<lb facs="P8_TL00068"/>passing nudged one another and smiled. Then he made<lb facs="P8_TL00069"/>certain purchases, and set about wasting time till nine<lb facs="P8_TL00070"/>o'clock.<lb facs="P8_TL00071"/>It is curious to consider, that although when he started<lb facs="P8_TL00072"/>out at nine o'clock, Gustave was perfectly clear as to what<lb facs="P8_TL00073"/>he meant to do, yet he was chiefly troubled by the fear that<lb facs="P8_TL00074"/>the priest had told his aunt about his fine clothes. But when<lb facs="P8_TL00075"/>he had passed through the deserted Faubourg, and had come<lb facs="P8_TL00076"/>to the house behind the shop, he found his aunt only very<lb facs="P8_TL00077"/>pleased to see him, and a little surprised. So he sat with<lb facs="P8_TL00078"/>her, and listened to her gentle, homely stories, and told lies<lb facs="P8_TL00079"/>about himself and his manner of life, till the clock struck<lb facs="P8_TL00080"/>eleven. Then he rose, and Madame Jahn rose too, and went<lb facs="P8_TL00081"/>to her writing-desk and opened a small drawer.<lb facs="P8_TL00082"/>"You have been very kind to a lonely old woman to-night,<lb facs="P8_TL00083"/>my Gustave," said Madame Jahn, smiling.<lb facs="P8_TL00084"/>"How sweet of you to say that, dearest aunt!" replied<lb facs="P8_TL00085"/>Gustave. He went over and passed his arm caressingly<lb facs="P8_TL00086"/>across her shoulders, and stabbed her in the heart.<lb facs="P8_TL00087"/>For a full five minutes after the murder he stood still; as<lb facs="P8_TL00088"/>men often do in a great crisis when they know that any<lb facs="P8_TL00089"/>movement means decisive action. Then he started, laid hold<lb facs="P8_TL00090"/>of his hat, and made for the door. But there the stinging<lb facs="P8_TL00091"/>knowledge of his crime came to him for the first time; and<lb facs="P8_TL00092"/>he turned back into the room. Madame Jahn's bedroom<lb facs="P8_TL00093"/>candle was on a table: he lit it, and passed through a door<lb facs="P8_TL00094"/>which led from the house into the shop. Crouching below<lb facs="P8_TL00095"/>the counters covered with white sheets, lest a streak of light<lb facs="P8_TL00096"/>ofn the windows might attract the observation of some<lb facs="P8_TL00097"/>passenger, he proceeded to a side entrance to the shop, un<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The notes he scat<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00101"/>tered about the floor; but two small bags of coin went into<lb facs="P8_TL00102"/>his coat. Then he took the candle and dropped some wax<lb facs="P8_TL00103"/>on the face and hands and dress of the corpse; he spilt wax,<lb facs="P8_TL00104"/>too, over the carpet, and then he broke the candle and ground<lb facs="P8_TL00105"/>it under his foot. He even tore with long nervous fingers at<lb facs="P8_TL00106"/>the dead woman's bodice till her breasts lay exposed; and<lb facs="P8_TL00107"/>plucked out a handful of her hair and threw it on the floor<lb facs="P8_TL00108"/>to stick to the wax. When all these things had been ac<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00109"/>complished, he went to the house door and listened. The<lb facs="P8_TL00110"/>Faubourg is always very quiet about twelve o'clock, and a<lb facs="P8_TL00111"/>single footstep falls on the night with a great sound. He<lb facs="P8_TL00112"/>could not hear the least noise: so he darted out and ran<lb facs="P8_TL00113"/>lightly till he came to a turning. There he fell into a<lb facs="P8_TL00114"/>sauntering walk, lit a cigarette, and hailing a passing fiacre,<lb facs="P8_TL00115"/>directed the man to drive to the Pont Saint-Michel. At the<lb facs="P8_TL00116"/>bridge he alighted, and noting that he was not eyed, he threw<lb facs="P8_TL00117"/>the key of the shop into the river. Then assuming the swagger<lb facs="P8_TL00118"/>and assurance of a half-drunken man, he marched up the<lb facs="P8_TL00119"/>Boulevard and entered the Cafe d'Harcourt.<lb facs="P8_TL00120"/>The place was filled with the usual crowd of men and<lb facs="P8_TL00121"/>women of the Quartier Latin.

It<lb facs="P8_TL00124"/>was his part to act quickly: so before the student had quite<lb facs="P8_TL00125"/>finished a sentence for his ear, the murderer gave him the<lb facs="P8_TL00126"/>lie.

                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00003"/>Gustave had supposed; and when he began to argue again,<lb facs="P9_TL00004"/>Gustave seized a glass full of brandy and water and threw<lb facs="P9_TL00005"/>the stuff in his face. Then indeed there was a row, till the<lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>gendarmes interfered, and haled Gustave to the station. At<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>the police-station he bitterly lamented his misdeed, which he<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>attributed to an extra glass of absinthe, and he begged the<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>authorities to carry word of his plight to his good aunt,<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>Madame Jahn, in our Faubourg. So to the house behind the<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>shop they went, and there they found her—sitting with her<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>breasts hanging out, her poor head clotted with blood, and a<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>knife in her heart.<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>The next morning, Gustave was set free. A man and<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>woman, two of the five assistants in the shop, had been<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>charged with the murder. The woman had been severely<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>reprimanded by Madame Jahn on the day before, and the<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>man was known to be the girl's paramour. It was the duty<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>of the man to close at night all the entrances into the shop,<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>save the main entrance, which was closed by Madame Jahn<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>and her deaf servant: and the police had formed a theory<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>(worked out with the amazing zeal and skill which cause the<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>Paris police so often to overreach themselves!) that the man<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>had failed to bolt one of the side doors, and had, by subtilty,<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>got possession of the key, whereby he and his accomplice<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>re-entered the place about midnight. Working on this theory,<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>the police had woven a web round the two unfortunates with<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>threads of steel; and there was little doubt, that both of them<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>would stretch their necks under the guillotine, with full<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>consent of press and public. At least, this was Gustave's<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>opinion; and Gustave's opinion now went for a great deal in<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>the Faubourg. Of course there were a few who murmured,<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>that it was a good thing poor Madame Jahn had not lived to<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>see her nephew arrested for a drunken brawler; but with full<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>remembrance of who owned the house and shop, we were<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>most of us inclined to say, after the priest: That if the brave<lb facs="P9_TL00037"/>Gustave had been with his aunt, the shocking affair could<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>never have occurred.

Why! on the day<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>of the funeral, when he heard the earth clatter down on the<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>coffin-lid in Pere la Chaise, he even swooned to the ground,<lb facs="P9_TL00042"/>and had to be carried out of the midst of the mourners. "Oh,<lb facs="P9_TL00043"/>yes," (quoth the gossips), "Gustave Herbout loved his aunt<lb facs="P9_TL00044"/>passing well!"<lb facs="P9_TL00045"/>On the night after the funeral, Gustave was sitting alone<lb facs="P9_TL00046"/>before the fire in Madame Jahn's room, smoking and making<lb facs="P9_TL00047"/>his plans. He thought, that when all this wretched mock<lb facs="P9_TL00048"/>grief and pretence of decorum was over, he would again visit<lb facs="P9_TL00049"/>the cafes which he greatly savoured, and the little Made<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The door<lb facs="P9_TL00054"/>was suddenly opened: a girl came in, walked straight over to<lb facs="P9_TL00055"/>the writing-desk, pulled out the small drawer, and then sat<lb facs="P9_TL00056"/>staring at the man by the fire. She was distinctly beautiful;<lb facs="P9_TL00057"/>although there was a certain old-fashionedness in her peculiar<lb facs="P9_TL00058"/>silken dress, and the manner of wearing her hair. Not once<lb facs="P9_TL00059"/>did it occur to Gustave, as he gazed in terror, that he was<lb facs="P9_TL00060"/>gazing on a mortal woman: the doors were too well bolted<lb facs="P9_TL00061"/>to allow any one from outside to enter, and besides, there<lb facs="P9_TL00062"/>was a strange baffling familiarity in the face and mien of the<lb facs="P9_TL00063"/>intruder.

He fled into the street, and walked,<lb facs="P9_TL00070"/>perhaps two miles, before he thought at all. But when he<lb facs="P9_TL00071"/>did think, he found that he was drawn against his will back<lb facs="P9_TL00072"/>to the house to see if It was still there: just as the police<lb facs="P9_TL00073"/>here believe a murderer is drawn to the Morgue to view the<lb facs="P9_TL00074"/>body of his victim. Yes; the girl was there still, with her<lb facs="P9_TL00075"/>great reproachless eyes; and throughout solemn night<lb facs="P9_TL00076"/>Gustave, haggard and mute, sat glaring at her. Towards<lb facs="P9_TL00077"/>dawn he fell into an uneasy doze; and when he awoke with<lb facs="P9_TL00078"/>a scream, he found that the girl was gone.<lb facs="P9_TL00079"/>At noon the next day, Gustave, heartened by several<lb facs="P9_TL00080"/>glasses of brandy, and cheered by the sunshine in the<lb facs="P9_TL00081"/>Champs-Ely sees, endeavoured to make light of the affair.<lb facs="P9_TL00082"/>He would gladly have arranged not to go back to the house:<lb facs="P9_TL00083"/>but then people would talk so much, and he could not afford<lb facs="P9_TL00084"/>to lose any custom out of the shop.

                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00092"/>though he left the house at once, with an iron resolution not<lb facs="P9_TL00093"/>to go back, he found himself drawn under them again, and<lb facs="P9_TL00094"/>he sat through the night before, sobbing and stupidly glaring.<lb facs="P9_TL00095"/>And all day long he crouched by the fire shuddering; and all<lb facs="P9_TL00096"/>the night till eleven o'clock; and then a figure of his aunt<lb facs="P9_TL00097"/>came to him again, but always a little older and more<lb facs="P9_TL00098"/>withered. And this went on for five days; the figure that sat<lb facs="P9_TL00099"/>with him becoming older and older as the days ran, till on the<lb facs="P9_TL00100"/>sixth night he gazed through the hours at his aunt as she<lb facs="P9_TL00101"/>was on the night he killed her. On these nights he was used<lb facs="P9_TL00102"/>sometimes to start up and make for the street, swearing never<lb facs="P9_TL00103"/>to return; but always he would be dragged back to the eyes.<lb facs="P9_TL00104"/>The policemen came to know him from these night walks,<lb facs="P9_TL00105"/>and people began to notice his bad looks: these could not<lb facs="P9_TL00106"/>spring from grief, folk said, and so they thought he was<lb facs="P9_TL00107"/>leading a wild life.<lb facs="P9_TL00108"/>On the seventh night there was a delay of about five<lb facs="P9_TL00109"/>minutes after the clock had rung eleven, before the door<lb facs="P9_TL00110"/>opened. And then—then, merciful God! the body of a woman<lb facs="P9_TL00111"/>in grave-clothes came into the room, as if borne by unseen<lb facs="P9_TL00112"/>men, and lay in the air across the writing-desk, while the<lb facs="P9_TL00113"/>small drawer flew open of its own accord. Yes; there was<lb facs="P9_TL00114"/>the shroud of the brown scapular, the prim white cap, the<lb facs="P9_TL00115"/>hands folded on the shrunken breast. Gray from slimy<lb facs="P9_TL00116"/>horror, Gustave raised himself up, and went over to look for<lb facs="P9_TL00117"/>the eyes. When he saw them pressed down with pennies, he<lb facs="P9_TL00118"/>reeled back and vomited into the grate.

                                    <lb facs="P10_TL00004"/>«MISS SPRINGTIME" at the Amsterdam Theater is <lb facs="P10_TL00005"/>iVI a new reminder for us that the blossoming- <lb facs="P10_TL00006"/>time of Austro-Hungarian, or as" it is called generally, <lb facs="P10_TL00007"/>Viennese operetta, has not passed yet, or hadn't passed, <lb facs="P10_TL00008"/>at least, at the time these unhappy struggles in Europe <lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>started. Emmerich Kalman is a composer who had found <lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>his country too small and who has conquered the world <lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>for himself with his "Sary." In "Miss Springtime" his <lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>melodies perhaps do not come as spontaneously but they <lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>still retained their fiery Hungarian rythm. The in- <lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>strumentation of the parts is very finely conceived and <lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>worked out in an extremely diligent manner. He was <lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>an inspiration to Jerome Kean, the American composer, <lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>who was called upon to enrich the music with melodies <lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>from his own fountain. One has to be an expert in order <lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>to recognize without "the pons asinorum" of the program <lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>where Kalman finishes and where Kean starts. Imitation <lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>of this kind is the most subtle form of flattery, a real <lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>tribute to the Hungarian composer. _ <lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>The new Hungarian diva who made her debut in the <lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>title-role, Miss Sari Petrass, is undoubtedly a success, <lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>She is only another one of the many popular actresses <lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>Austria has sent us during the last few years. Her play <lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>is not so exceptionally temperamental; her voice while <lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>a very good quality is not very phenomenal, but the <lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>entire portrayal of her part is extremely artistic. Her <lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>acting and her singing show at all times her good <lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>European schooling. The author of the American version <lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>of the libretto, Guy Bolton, opened up large possibilities <lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>for a real American comic-opera, and Jack Hazard, one <lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>of our best living light-opera comedians, uses every one <lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>of the many occasions and really surpasses himself. <lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>Very interesting were the "legitimate" dramatic <lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>novelties of this past week that gave us, in the midst of <lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>Indian summer, the golden sunrays of "Miss Spring- <lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>tjme » <lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>In the L.and H.

The style of the performance<lb facs="P10_TL00052"/>was well selected by the actors; most astonishing was it<lb facs="P10_TL00053"/>to see that not only the old generation among the<lb facs="P10_TL00054"/>audience but the younger generation, too, seemed spell<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The old school of critics which declares that<lb facs="P10_TL00056"/>"show is show" and everything old and nothing new were<lb facs="P10_TL00057"/>right in this case of "The Intruder."<lb facs="P10_TL00058"/>A curious piece came before the footlights of the<lb facs="P10_TL00059"/>Fulton Theater: "Arms and the Girl" by Grant Stewart<lb facs="P10_TL00060"/>and Robt. Becker. These two American authors seemed<lb facs="P10_TL00061"/>to know only a little of the war entangling the world at<lb facs="P10_TL00062"/>the present time. Of course they know of its existence<lb facs="P10_TL00063"/>but they treat the European struggles something very<lb facs="P10_TL00064"/>distant; like a legend or a fairy tale. Bourbofis who<lb facs="P10_TL00065"/>have forgotten nothing for the last twenty years write<lb facs="P10_TL00066"/>a romantic drama with the war as a background. A<lb facs="P10_TL00067"/>drama that plays somewhere in the romantic nowhere,<lb facs="P10_TL00068"/>something a la Anthony Hope. Hero and heroine are<lb facs="P10_TL00069"/>an American couple unexpectedly surprised and brought<lb facs="P10_TL00070"/>together by the German Invasion of Belgium. The<lb facs="P10_TL00071"/>Germans in their field-gray uniforms are portrayed as<lb facs="P10_TL00072"/>nice people but impossibly comical; they seem figures<lb facs="P10_TL00073"/>from an light opera. The general appears to have only<lb facs="P10_TL00074"/>one occupation in Belgium i.e. to play a sort of earthly<lb facs="P10_TL00075"/>providence for the improbable love-adventures of the<lb facs="P10_TL00076"/>two Americans. The, German field-gray soldiers are<lb facs="P10_TL00077"/>undoubtedly German reservists in real life.<lb facs="P10_TL00078"/>It is refreshing indeed to realize in these times full<lb facs="P10_TL00079"/>of hatred that even war has its merry side. The charm<lb facs="P10_TL00080"/>of the play increases through the actors. Cyril Scott has<lb facs="P10_TL00081"/>a part that after a long while again just seems to suit<lb facs="P10_TL00082"/>his personality.

                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00087"/>for notoriety. Sensation thirsty women with short hair and<lb facs="P12_TL00088"/>husbands in the family skeleton closet tried to say their<lb facs="P12_TL00089"/>nothing in the form of Kreymborg's poetry; shirt salesmen<lb facs="P12_TL00090"/>who longed for the Bohemia of italian red-ink-roosts<lb facs="P12_TL00091"/>discovered all at once their souls with mushroom growths.<lb facs="P12_TL00092"/>Mushrooms became a very common dish, indeed. Bob Davis,<lb facs="P12_TL00093"/>head buyer of Mr. Munsey's purchasing department, got the<lb facs="P12_TL00094"/>mushroom appetite, and so he entered them upon the stock<lb facs="P12_TL00095"/>exchange list; they went high up in price.

"Poetry," Harriet Monroe's<lb facs="P12_TL00099"/>endowed magazine of verse, was, since its start, the goal of t<lb facs="P12_TL00100"/>ambition for the American poet. Kreymborg got there. He<lb facs="P12_TL00101"/>had arrived. The arrival upon those pages means unanimous<lb facs="P12_TL00102"/>election to the mutual self admiration society of poets.<lb facs="P12_TL00103"/>Kreymborg fell again. Nice old ladies from East Oshkosh<lb facs="P12_TL00104"/>and anaemic under graduates of the University of Wisconsin,<lb facs="P12_TL00105"/>together with a few geniuses, who had burned up the few<lb facs="P12_TL00106"/>drops of their oil in Europe and had brought over the ashes<lb facs="P12_TL00107"/>in costly little caskets to our shores, offered material galore<lb facs="P12_TL00108"/>to start a magazine. Poor, sincere Kreymborg took the crops<lb facs="P12_TL00109"/>of insincere thinking, of lying brains, of notoriety-thirsty<lb facs="P12_TL00110"/>imagination and of would be creative imitation for a rich<lb facs="P12_TL00111"/>harvest of other sincere souls that struggled for expression.<lb facs="P12_TL00112"/>A Maecenas with a bunch of poems tucked away somewhere<lb facs="P12_TL00113"/>in a pigeon hole of his business desk is always ready to be |<lb facs="P12_TL00114"/>godfather when an inexpensive magazine will print his<lb facs="P12_TL00115"/>poetry. %<lb facs="P12_TL00116"/>"Others" was published.

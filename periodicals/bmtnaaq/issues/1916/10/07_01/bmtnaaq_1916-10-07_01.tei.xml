                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00023"/>ALTHOUGH as yet, perhaps, he is little known in America,<lb facs="P3_TL00024"/>Richard Middleton has lately been hailed in England as<lb facs="P3_TL00025"/>really great writer, alike of verse and of prose. He was a<lb facs="P3_TL00026"/>clerk in a London insurance office, contributing to various<lb facs="P3_TL00027"/>periodicals in his spare time; but hating business, he<lb facs="P3_TL00028"/>renounced it, intending to live by his pen. And, finding this<lb facs="P3_TL00029"/>far from easy, he endured some years of terrible privation,<lb facs="P3_TL00030"/>the result being that ultimately he took his own life, his age<lb facs="P3_TL00031"/>at that time being only a little past thirty. Since then his<lb facs="P3_TL00032"/>scattered writings have been collected and issued in book<lb facs="P3_TL00033"/>form, the collection amounting to five little volumes. And,<lb facs="P3_TL00034"/>if the pathos attaching to the author's story is responsible,<lb facs="P3_TL00035"/>partly, for the ardour with which these posthumous books<lb facs="P3_TL00036"/>of his have been welcomed, their avowed admirers include<lb facs="P3_TL00037"/>numerous eminent men of letters: Mr. Arthur Machen, for<lb facs="P3_TL00038"/>instance, and that fervent Shakespearian, Mr. Frank Harris,<lb facs="P3_TL00039"/>*Mr. Wilfred Gibson, too, himself a fine poet on occasion, has<lb facs="P3_TL00040"/>added his quota to the chorus of homage; while, turning to<lb facs="P3_TL00041"/>Mr. Henry Savage's preface to Middleton's Poems and Songs,<lb facs="P3_TL00042"/>one finds it alleged concerning this verse: "There is that in<lb facs="P3_TL00043"/>it beyond the reach of criticism." Mr. Savage even predicts<lb facs="P3_TL00044"/>immortality for his idol, while referring in particular to the<lb facs="P3_TL00045"/>latter's work as essayist and story-teller, he compares him<lb facs="P3_TL00046"/>fondly to Stevenson.<lb facs="P3_TL00047"/>And certainly the technical excellence of Middleton's out<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

For most poets, it must be remembered, fail<lb facs="P3_TL00055"/>much oftener than they triumph; and the artistic level<lb facs="P3_TL00056"/>maintained, throughout the rank and file of their creations,<lb facs="P3_TL00057"/>is far from being a very high one. But open Middleton's<lb facs="P3_TL00058"/>poetry at random, and a lofty beauty of wording and rhythm<lb facs="P3_TL00059"/>is nearly always found: it is as omnipresent as skilful music<lb facs="P3_TL00060"/>is in Mendelsohn's work, or skilful painting in Nicolas<lb facs="P3_TL00061"/>Lancret's. Still, does not Middleton reflect Mendelssohn's<lb facs="P3_TL00062"/>most serious failing? Does he not disclose, only too often,<lb facs="P3_TL00063"/>just that limitation which comes near vitiating all that Lancret<lb facs="P3_TL00064"/>did? And his weakness in these respects, its precise nature<lb facs="P3_TL00065"/>to be unfolded presently, is emphasized by Mr. Savage when,<lb facs="P3_TL00066"/>eager to praise, he calls attention to the writer's similarity<lb facs="P3_TL00067"/>to two of his predecessors.<lb facs="P3_TL00068"/>It must be borne in mind that every immortal work of art<lb facs="P3_TL00069"/>is more than the lovely expression of an emotion: it is some<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00070"/>thing which exerts a sort of hypnotic spell, the artist making<lb facs="P3_TL00071"/>his audience actually experience the feeling which inspired<lb facs="P3_TL00072"/>him. Nor is the true master* one who just attains the<lb facs="P3_TL00073"/>orthodox beauties of craftsmanship, but who creates a new<lb facs="P3_TL00074"/>world of his own, to reign over it as suverain. The very<lb facs="P3_TL00075"/>greatest, of course, have derived much of their craft from<lb facs="P3_TL00076"/>study of their predecessors; yet pondering even on those<lb facs="P3_TL00077"/>lesser men who truly possessed genius, it transpires quickly<lb facs="P3_TL00078"/>that the name of each of these is associated closely with some<lb facs="P3_TL00079"/>little kingdom which he holds in fee, the mere mention of<lb facs="P3_TL00080"/>Teniers, for example, bringing to mind a certain type of<lb facs="P3_TL00081"/>painting, the mere mention of Charles Lamb, a certain species<lb facs="P3_TL00082"/>of literature. Now Lancret, notwithstanding his virtuosity,<lb facs="P3_TL00083"/>is always a mere regent to Watteau; while the slight original<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00084"/>ity which Mendelssohn showed in Athalie and Midsummer<lb facs="P3_TL00085"/>Night's Dream, proved insufficient to make him an overlord<lb facs="P3_TL00086"/>anywhere. And, in the same way, it can hardly be said that<lb facs="P3_TL00087"/>Middleton, writing invariably with such exceptional skill,<lb facs="P3_TL00088"/>excels in any given line; or that his name is ever likely to<lb facs="P3_TL00089"/>become, in the mind of the world, representative of so much<lb facs="P3_TL00090"/>as a tiny duchy.

"Go, if you wish it," she<lb facs="P5_TL00046"/>said; "but remember that you have always two friends here.<lb facs="P5_TL00047"/>Is it not so, Clotilde?"<lb facs="P5_TL00048"/>Alphonse was taken with a hard shudder as he went out.<lb facs="P5_TL00049"/>He decided to go to England; with an ultimate thought,<lb facs="P5_TL00050"/>perhaps, of America. He crossed the channel in wintry and<lb facs="P5_TL00051"/>boisterous weather, and when he came to Dover he was well<lb facs="P5_TL00052"/>content to lie there: postponing, gratefully enough, his arrival<lb facs="P5_TL00053"/>at London till the next day. Tired with his tossing journey,<lb facs="P5_TL00054"/>he took to his bed early; and at once fell into the profound<lb facs="P5_TL00055"/>sleep of fatigue, from which he awoke, about two o'clock,<lb facs="P5_TL00056"/>hot and trembling. The figure of the child was before him<lb facs="P5_TL00057"/>in the darkness of the room; the full throat, above all! was<lb facs="P5_TL00058"/>apparent and particular. He rolled on the bed, and tore and<lb facs="P5_TL00059"/>bit the pillows: not before had he longed with this violent<lb facs="P5_TL00060"/>frenzy to see the child stretched at his feet, looking solidly<lb facs="P5_TL00061"/>white and dead. Damp and shaking, he put on his clothes<lb facs="P5_TL00062"/>and went down to talk with the night-porterâ€”a desperate<lb facs="P5_TL00063"/>chance under the best conditions; for a foreigner, hopeless!<lb facs="P5_TL00064"/>as he found. So he returned to his room, and opened his<lb facs="P5_TL00065"/>windows to the raining night. A strong salt wind was singing</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00067"/>up channel; and Alphonse let it get into his hair and eyes,<lb facs="P5_TL00068"/>finding respite in this way, and a certain peace. Thus he spent<lb facs="P5_TL00069"/>the night, till the dawn came to shew the gray, uneasy sea,<lb facs="P5_TL00070"/>and the gray sky. He departed, when morning had come, on<lb facs="P5_TL00071"/>board the earliest packet-boat, and that evening he found<lb facs="P5_TL00072"/>himself again in Paris.<lb facs="P5_TL00073"/>Things having come to this point, you may ask fairly: Why<lb facs="P5_TL00074"/>did he not turn to the obvious remedyâ€”self-destruction?<lb facs="P5_TL00075"/>Yes! But upon reflection it does not seem so likely. Indeed,<lb facs="P5_TL00076"/>upon reflection it would appear, that when a man has a<lb facs="P5_TL00077"/>desire, a fierce lust to satisfy, he prefers, however the powers<lb facs="P5_TL00078"/>of his soul may rebel, to live for the gratification of that<lb facs="P5_TL00079"/>desire, that fierce lust. Be that as it will, the man I am<lb facs="P5_TL00080"/>writing about did not contemplate suicide; did not, for a<lb facs="P5_TL00081"/>moment, glance along that road of escape. But he gave a<lb facs="P5_TL00082"/>dainty supper, to " which he invited some of his male<lb facs="P5_TL00083"/>acquaintance, and a few ladies of generous virtue. There<lb facs="P5_TL00084"/>sat by him a superb creature, with gleaming shoulders and<lb facs="P5_TL00085"/>snapping black eyes; and as the mirth grew more disordered,<lb facs="P5_TL00086"/>he laid his hand on her swelling throat and tried to tempt<lb facs="P5_TL00087"/>himself to kill her in the sight of te revellers. Any one<lb facs="P5_TL00088"/>rather than the child! But even as he thought it, the child<lb facs="P5_TL00089"/>floated before his eyes; the remembrance of the strange<lb facs="P5_TL00090"/>satiety he would feel when he had choked out her life, which<lb facs="P5_TL00091"/>he would not feel at all were he to kill this woman, caused<lb facs="P5_TL00092"/>his hand to fall listlessly to his side; and pleading a sudden<lb facs="P5_TL00093"/>dizziness, he left the merrymakers to themselves.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00003"/>So on the next afternoon, we find him once more repairing<lb facs="P6_TL00004"/>to the Champs-Elysees and the house of Madame Dantonel.<lb facs="P6_TL00005"/>He was feeling easier to-day; and he discovered at Madame<lb facs="P6_TL00006"/>DantoneFs, one visitor who helped to soothe his irritated<lb facs="P6_TL00007"/>nerves. This was an old military officer: and Alphonse found<lb facs="P6_TL00008"/>his cheerfulness and honest geniality of character very<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>pleasant. He had sat for about twenty minutes, when<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>Madame Dantonel exclaimed:â€”<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>"My poor little Clotilde! She has a cold, a slight sore<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>throat, and this is the time when the bonne goes down-stairs,<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>so she will be quite alone. Forgive me if Igo to her."<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>The time had come. "Permit me!" said Alphonse, on his<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>feet in an instant. It was as though a stranger were talking:<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>he could no more help the words than he could help breath:<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>ing. "Pray do not deprive Monsieur of your company. I<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>will go to Clothilde; it will delight me to see her, and I know<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>the room quite well."<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>He hardly waited for the murmured pleasure, but ran,<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>trembling with eagerness, up the stairs. The little girl was<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>in bed playing with her doll, and she greeted him with a<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>smile and a glad cry. He clenched his teeth, and squeezed<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>and crushed her throat till the pretty tiny face became black<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>and swollen, and the poor little frame, after a shake and a<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>quiver, lay quite still.<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>As he came down, he heard Madame Dantonel say good<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>bye to the visitor, and the hush of her dress as she passed<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>through the hall.<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>"Mon Dieu! how pale you look!" she cried, raising both<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>hands. "Is anything the matter with Clotilde?"<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>"Clotilde is very well," says Alphonse.. "But I think the<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>room was too hot for me, and I am going away now."<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>"Really! so soon?" she said, genuinely sorry. And she<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>held out her hand.<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>"No! please don't shake hands with me, I am not worthy!"<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>cries Alphonse, with a wan smile, passing the matter off as<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>a jest. "You will find Clotilde very well," he said again.<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>The door closed behind him. As the mother went upstairs<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>to her child, he took his way to a chymist's shop which he<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>knew of in the neighborhood.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>meaning patriots (in peace time occasionally spelt<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>chauvins) that Paris had alloved itself to be Influenced<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>by Munich. I think the opposite was very much more the<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>case but the mistake originated in this wise: In Paris<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>are born ideas innumerable, conceived, maybe, from an<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>infinite variety of international sources, ideas so various<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>that Paris cannot keep count of them.

"Of cource, I do: one bread, one meat,<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>and one butter card."<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>This jest was composed at Munich but the picture was<lb facs="P8_TL00045"/>"'painted" and exhibited in Paris where I saw it at the<lb facs="P8_TL00046"/>Gallerie des Independants, 52 Rue La Boetie, not two<lb facs="P8_TL00047"/>months ago, signed Picasso.

Picasso had<lb facs="P8_TL00050"/>pinned different slips of plain or coloured paper on to a<lb facs="P8_TL00051"/>card-board ground and the number of this combination<lb facs="P8_TL00052"/>corresponded in the catalogue to a "dessin." A disciple<lb facs="P8_TL00053"/>of his had, to pins, preferred the glue-pot for the affixing<lb facs="P8_TL00054"/>of different elements such as the packings of grocery<lb facs="P8_TL00055"/>wares; as who should take one side of a "Quaker oats"<lb facs="P8_TL00056"/>box, paste it on te a board with the label of, say, a whisky<lb facs="P8_TL00057"/>bottle, frame the whole and call it a "nature-morte."<lb facs="P8_TL00058"/>Thus the leavings and parings ordinarily thrown into the<lb facs="P8_TL00059"/>dust-bin can become as valuable to the modern artist<lb facs="P8_TL00060"/>(especially considering the increase to which palette<lb facs="P8_TL00061"/>colours have been subjected) as, it is said, they are in<lb facs="P8_TL00062"/>certain countries to the family cook.

We decided to get married im<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>mediately after I had gotten some clothes for her. I didn't<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>intend to buy ajl the things on her list. She could do that<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>herself later on. We had just decided that the minister of<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>the Twelfth Street Church should be called upon to perform<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>the marriage ceremony, as the door-bell rang. I wondered<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>who it could be. She went hastily into the other room and<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>I opened.<lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>It was only the letter carrier. A lot of bills. I just looked<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>over the bunch. "Haâ€”what was that? the familiar hand<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>writing of an art dealer. I opened the envelope. It contained<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>a check, eighty dollars payable to me. It wasn't much to<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>start housekeeping on but the situation was cleared. "Here,<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>Nora, only the mail carrier," I called. Yes, she had told me<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>her name, and her father's, a very well-sounding name, a<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>name that spelled money in seven figures. "There are a few<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>formalities I wish you to do before we start our travel<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>through life," I said, "first of all, put all the money and all<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>the jewelry you have with you in this big envelope. I'll send<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>it back to your father. I got a check here which will be<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>enough for a starter. It won't be a wonderful dress I am<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>going to bring you, but just a plain black dress your aunt's<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>maid might have worn," and I laughed. I wasn't afraid she<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>would change her mind and even if she wanted to, she<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>couldn't have left the apartment in a decollete evening gown<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>at eleven o'clock in the morning.<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>First of all I went to the minister and asked him to come<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>to my apartment at twelve-thirty. Then I got, at the City<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>Hall, a marriage license. Then I went to a department store,<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>bought a suit for twenty-eight dollars and fifty cents, a<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>nightgown, and some toilet articles I thought of immediate<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>necessity. I went to Tiffany's and bought the plainest and<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>yellowest wedding ring they have. I am a master at matching<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>colors and surely enough, the ring matched her hair. There<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>was not time to have it engraved, it could be done later. On<lb facs="P10_TL00044"/>my way home, I stopped in a delicatessen store and ordered a<lb facs="P10_TL00045"/>lot of things sent to my apartment. The suit fitted like made<lb facs="P10_TL00046"/>to order. There was just one thing that I had overlooked. I<lb facs="P10_TL00047"/>called up the florist and had him send up the biggest bunch<lb facs="P10_TL00048"/>of violets in his store.<lb facs="P10_TL00049"/>Nora was carried away by the spirit of her undertaking.<lb facs="P10_TL00050"/>She had done her best to transform the picturesque room<lb facs="P10_TL00051"/>into an orderly-looking library, or at least, it looked like one<lb facs="P10_TL00052"/>after it was strongly suggested to me. She had even put<lb facs="P10_TL00053"/>some new coal in the grate and everything was ready for the<lb facs="P10_TL00054"/>minister. She seemed so happy, and she called me Jine, and<lb facs="P10_TL00055"/>it seemed as if we had known each other for years. The<lb facs="P10_TL00056"/>minister arrived at twelve-thirty sharp. I went into the next<lb facs="P10_TL00057"/>apartment and got a couple of witnesses. We were married<lb facs="P10_TL00058"/>inside of the next five minutes. I gave the ten<lb facs="P10_TL00059"/>dollars and asked him if he wouldn't perform the office of an<lb facs="P10_TL00060"/>angel of peace and delivery. I told him about the jewelry<lb facs="P10_TL00061"/>and the several hundred dollars in the big envelope and asked<lb facs="P10_TL00062"/>him to deliver it to my father-in-law, together with our</ab>

We made a lot of<lb facs="P10_TL00068"/>plans for our future life and we were as happy as a couple<lb facs="P10_TL00069"/>of children that play husband and wife. She liked my coffee<lb facs="P10_TL00070"/>better, she said, than any coffee she had ever drunk before<lb facs="P10_TL00071"/>in her life. Father and mother-in-law arrived at five o'clock<lb facs="P10_TL00072"/>sharp. The dear old people didn't know how to act in Nora's<lb facs="P10_TL00073"/>new residence. But he was the real father of his daughter.<lb facs="P10_TL00074"/>He was "game." She, of course, was a little harder to<lb facs="P10_TL00075"/>manage, but we hoped the best as we dismissed them about<lb facs="P10_TL00076"/>seven o'clock. But both agreed that I did know how to make<lb facs="P10_TL00077"/>coffee splendidly.<lb facs="P10_TL00078"/>We went out for a walk. Up Fifth Avenue, around Union<lb facs="P10_TL00079"/>Square with its wretched figures on the benches. On Madison<lb facs="P10_TL00080"/>Square we sent a long bed line of homeless men to a lodging<lb facs="P10_TL00081"/>house. We looked at the window displays of the shops on<lb facs="P10_TL00082"/>Fifth Avenue and turned in on Thirty-fourth Street, passing<lb facs="P10_TL00083"/>the corner where we had "met" yesterday. We stood still<lb facs="P10_TL00084"/>for a while and viewed the hustling crowds.<lb facs="P10_TL00085"/>"What a drama!" I said to her. "Just look at all these<lb facs="P10_TL00086"/>men and all these women. They all have a goal. They all<lb facs="P10_TL00087"/>want to reach a destination. And while they are on their<lb facs="P10_TL00088"/>way, they act for us, the bystanders, a real play." Exactly<lb facs="P10_TL00089"/>like yesterday did she thrust her arm in mine and guided me<lb facs="P10_TL00090"/>through the crowd towards the quieter Sixth Avenue.<lb facs="P10_TL00091"/>"Don't we have our goal, too, and our destinations?" 9he<lb facs="P10_TL00092"/>asked. "Didn't we start rather well our performance?"<lb facs="P10_TL00093"/>She pressed my arm and we walked home.</ab>

Majorie, Billy<lb facs="P13_TL00010"/>and I were standing in the lobby of the Astor when he<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>passed, perfunctorily greeted Billy, hesitated and then<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>stopped. As a matter of common courtesy Billy introduced<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>us .... . and that was our introduction.<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>Five months afterwards, hurrying down Fifth Avenue, I<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>suddenly found my hand being imprisoned and somebody<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>saying "I have tried and tried to find you since our meeting<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>and just as I have almost given it up, you try to walk right<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>through me," and I looked up into "his" face. I was sur<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>prised at the enjoyment he seemed to get out of our meeting.<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>Couldn't I spare a little time out of my "butterfly existence"<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>to see him occasionally? His way of asking seemed so odd,<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>and the fact that I was almost a little elated at having a man<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>of his age express such plain interest in me, made me to say<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>"Yes." The novelty of it all appealed to me. I was only<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>twenty one and he was every bit of thirty eight.<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>Each time that he asked me to see him, to talk, to walk,<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>to lunch, he apologized for being so greedy, for taking my<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>time away from my young friends.

                                    <lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>cause I told him. He knew as much about me as I knew,<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>and divined more than I did. Nothing that I told him about<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>my newest love affair, about all my breathless little situations,<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>seemed new to him. He simply gave me advice and stayed<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>serious. I often wondered if he laughed inside, but even as<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>I wondered what he thought of me, nothing could prevent me<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>from talking, talking, and incidentally telling, telling every<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

But, the longer<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>I knew him, the more I told him, and confieded nonsences, the<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>older he seemed to appear in my mind.

Inherently a coward, I did<lb facs="P13_TL00072"/>not stir, until "he" spoke. "I have been watching you from<lb facs="P13_TL00073"/>the piazza where I have been stealing a goodnight smoke, for<lb facs="P13_TL00074"/>the last twenty minutes.

I talked and talked and talked and*<lb facs="P13_TL00081"/>I remember being surprised that I did not know what I wa&amp;<lb facs="P13_TL00082"/>going to say, even while I was saying it, that I marvelled<lb facs="P13_TL00083"/>that the thoughts that I was thinking, broken, darting<lb facs="P13_TL00084"/>thoughts, made sense and sounded well when the words came<lb facs="P13_TL00085"/>out of my mouth. I knew that I was talking low and tensely,<lb facs="P13_TL00086"/>a bit fiercely, but it seemed as though someone else was<lb facs="P13_TL00087"/>talking and I listened to every word that I spoke asthough I<lb facs="P13_TL00088"/>had never heard or thought of it before. My voice seemed<lb facs="P13_TL00089"/>far away and I wished that I could uncross my limbs because<lb facs="P13_TL00090"/>they were beginning to feel icy and my hands were of ice..<lb facs="P13_TL00091"/>When I stopped to consider the expression on "his" face, to<lb facs="P13_TL00092"/>realize that his eyes had not moved from mine from the<lb facs="P13_TL00093"/>minute he sat down, I wanted to laugh. I restrained myself,<lb facs="P13_TL00094"/>I was afraid to. I grew angry because my cigarette was;<lb facs="P13_TL00095"/>burnt down to the point where it was burning my fingers. The<lb facs="P13_TL00096"/>cigarette was all burnt down, I tossed it away and stopped<lb facs="P13_TL00097"/>talking, just as if I had placed a crisp period after my last<lb facs="P13_TL00098"/>sentence and I sighed, because I felt an infinite sense of<lb facs="P13_TL00099"/>relief when I stopped talking, like a very tired child.

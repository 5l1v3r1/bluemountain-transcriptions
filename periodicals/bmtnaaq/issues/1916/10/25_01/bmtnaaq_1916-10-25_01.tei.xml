                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00008"/>pleasant one; for in that stable for thirty years had dwelt<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>thirty thousand oxen, and never had a cleaning shovel inter<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>fered among them. First, Hercules tried broom and shovel.<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>Then howled the oxen—imagine thirty thousand oxen: "Let<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>be that dirt: that is our dirt!"<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>"The dickens!" exclaimed Hercules and started to remove<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>the refuse. "We want to keep our filth," howled the oxen<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>and showed their horns. But Hercules hit them on the ears<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>with his shovel, bade them keep silence, and unmindful of<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>the odor kept at his task.<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>"Ho, look at the pig!" jeered the oxen. "You are the<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>pigs," said Hercules, "because you are at fault for the dirt<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>around here.

But now the little bugs, who had<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>for long dwelt in the filthy mess, crawled about. "Leave<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>our filth alone," growled they. "It is not yours, but the<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>oxen's," replied Hercules. "Yes, but we'll freeze, if you<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>remove it." "Then go to work, and you will not freeze."<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>And they went to work. In the night, while Hercules slept,<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>they moved back all the dirt which he had shovelled out dur<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>ing the daytime. And when morning dawned, everything<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>was as filthy as before.<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>When Hercules saw this, his anger was roused. "Now<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>there is nothing I can do, but put the whole stable under<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>jwater." When the oxen heard him mention water, the which<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>they had not felt in thirty years, they were maddened and<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>howled so loudly, that the miserable bugs who were hiding<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>in the darkness, flew up to seek shelter on the broad backs<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>of the bovines. But Hercules was not to be balked. He<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>dug a trench from the nearest brook and flooded the stable.<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>"He is an enemy of the people," wailed the oxen. "He<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>wants to destroy society; he will flood the whole world."<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>"That is not true," answered Hercules. "I only want to<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>clean up this mess, and I am no enemy of the people, but<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>a foe to oxen and to parasite bugs who revel in filth."<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>After cleaning up Hercules retired to rest.<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>"How can we take revenge?" asked the oxen. "He fears<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>not our horns; have we no other weapons?" "Let us throw<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>dirt at him," urged some. "That he can wash off," said<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>others. So talking and considering, they came to the con<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>clusion that they had no weapons against Hercules.<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>But one of the dirty little bugs, who had listened to their<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>talk, had an idea. "Put him under water," he advised— "Put<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>him under water, as he did with our stable." "Yes, that's it!<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>But where get the water?" The bug whispered into the<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>ox's ear, the ox told his neighbor, and soon all the oxen<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>knew how water was to be had.<lb facs="P6_TL00056"/>Hercules suddenly woke, surrounded by a dirty flood, but<lb facs="P6_TL00057"/>for reasons easily understood, the flood soon ceased.

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00058"/>cules grabbed his club and ran to the stable. There he<lb facs="P6_TL00059"/>pondered: "One would not kill a louse with a bludgeon.<lb facs="P6_TL00060"/>Could you not have used clean water as I did? But what<lb facs="P6_TL00061"/>is to be done! Oxen always remain oxen.

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00065"/>Now, this doctor was an ignorant dog, whom I had been<lb facs="P8_TL00066"/>forced to exclude from the house, because he went about<lb facs="P8_TL00067"/>proclaiming his belief in a saving God, at the same time<lb facs="P8_TL00068"/>that he proclaimed himself a man of science. He, I was<lb facs="P8_TL00069"/>resolved, should never cross my threshold, and I followed<lb facs="P8_TL00070"/>Mrs. Pebble through the house, screaming out prohibition.<lb facs="P8_TL00071"/>But I did not catch even a groan from her, not a nod of the<lb facs="P8_TL00072"/>head nor cast of the eye, to shew that she had heard.<lb facs="P8_TL00073"/>I met the doctor at the door of the library. "Well!" I<lb facs="P8_TL00074"/>sneered, throwing my hand in his face, "have you come to<lb facs="P8_TL00075"/>teach me some new prayers?"<lb facs="P8_TL00076"/>He brushed by me as if he had not felt the blow, and<lb facs="P8_TL00077"/>knelt down by the sofa.<lb facs="P8_TL00078"/>"Rupture of a vessel on the brain, I think," he says to<lb facs="P8_TL00079"/>Soames and Mrs. Pebble after a moment. "He has been<lb facs="P8_TL00080"/>dead some hours. Poor fellow! You had better telegraph<lb facs="P8_TL00081"/>for his sister, and I will send up the undertaker to arrange<lb facs="P8_TL00082"/>the body."<lb facs="P8_TL00083"/>"You liar!" I yelled. "You whining liar! How have you<lb facs="P8_TL00084"/>the insolence to tell my servants that I am dead, when you<lb facs="P8_TL00085"/>see me here face to face?"<lb facs="P8_TL00086"/>He was far in the passage, with Soames and Mrs. Pebble<lb facs="P8_TL00087"/>at his heels, ere I had ended, and not one of the three turned<lb facs="P8_TL00088"/>round.<lb facs="P8_TL00089"/>All that night I sat in the library. Strangely enough, I<lb facs="P8_TL00090"/>had no wish to sleep, nor, during the time that followed, had<lb facs="P8_TL00091"/>I any craving to eat. In the morning the men came, and al<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00092"/>though I ordered them out, they proceeded to minister about<lb facs="P8_TL00093"/>something I could not see . So all day I stayed in the<lb facs="P8_TL00094"/>library or wandered about the house, and at night the men<lb facs="P8_TL00095"/>came again, bringing with them a coffin. Then, in my<lb facs="P8_TL00096"/>humour, thinking it shame that so fine a coffin should be<lb facs="P8_TL00097"/>empty, I lay the night in it, and slept a soft, dreamless<lb facs="P8_TL00098"/>sleep—the softest sleep I have ever slept. And when the<lb facs="P8_TL00099"/>men came the next day, I rested still, and the undertaker<lb facs="P8_TL00100"/>shaved me. A strange valet!<lb facs="P8_TL00101"/>On the evening after that, I was coming down-stairs, when<lb facs="P8_TL00102"/>I noted some luggage in the hall, and so learned that my<lb facs="P8_TL00103"/>sister had arrived. I had not seen this woman since her<lb facs="P8_TL00104"/>marriage, and I loathed her more than I loathed any crea<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

She was very beautiful I<lb facs="P8_TL00106"/>think—tall, and dark, and straight as a ram-rod—and she<lb facs="P8_TL00107"/>had an unruly passion for scandal and dress. I suppose the<lb facs="P8_TL00108"/>reason I disliked her so intensely was, that she had a habit<lb facs="P8_TL00109"/>of making one aware of her presence when she was several<lb facs="P8_TL00110"/>yards off. At half-past nine o'clock my sister came down to<lb facs="P8_TL00111"/>the library in a very charming wrap, and I soon found that<lb facs="P8_TL00112"/>she was as insensible to my presence as the others. I<lb facs="P8_TL00113"/>trembled with rage to see her kneel down by the coffin—<lb facs="P8_TL00114"/>my coffin; but when she bent over to kiss the pillow I threw<lb facs="P8_TL00115"/>away control.<lb facs="P8_TL00116"/>A knife which had been used to cut string was lying on a<lb facs="P8_TL00117"/>table: I seized it and drove it into her neck.

About eleven o'clock I observed that the house was<lb facs="P8_TL00124"/>filled with blacks, and mutes, and folk of the county, who<lb facs="P8_TL00125"/>came for the obsequies. I went into the library and sat<lb facs="P8_TL00126"/>still, and waited. Soon came the men, and they closed the</ab>

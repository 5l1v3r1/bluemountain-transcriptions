In 1660 a regiment of Croats arrived in<lb facs="P5_TL00010"/>France; a part of their singular costume excited the greatest<lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>admiration, and was immediately and generally imitated; this<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>was a tour de cou, made (for the private soldiers) of common<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>lace, and of muslin or silk for the officers; the ends were<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>arranged en rosette, or ornamented with button or tuft, which<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>hung gracefully on the breast. This new arrangement, which<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>confined the throat but very slightly, was at first termed a<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>Croat, since corrupted to Cravat. The Cravats of the officers<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>and people of rank were extremely fine, and the ends were<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>embroidered or trimmed with broad lace; those for the lower<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>classes were subsequently made of cloth or cotton, or at the<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>best of black taffeta, plaited; which was tied round the neck<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>by two small strings. These strings were at a later period<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>replaced by clasps, or a buckle, and the Cravat then took the<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>name of Stock.<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>The Cravat at length became universal, and was increased<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>to an almost incredible size.

Some of the papers, it is<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>to be supposed, will cut down their size, and it does not<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>seem cynical to prophecy that the curtailment will begin<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>with the literary and artistic columns.<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>The word of translations from the Russian and books on<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>Russia keeps up its pressure.

                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>terest for foreign belle lettres seems very plausible. Many<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>thousand dollars' worth of books are bought daily by the<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>various war relief societies and by individuals who are ship<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Mr. Hammond<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>contends that he sold more books by Balzac and by Dickens<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>during the last six months than he ordinarily would sell in<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>the course of five years, depending upon his New York trade.<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>It was a good joke upon H.

He bought a lot of<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>books at a recent auction sale and after looking them over,<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>evidently not too careiully, designated them to his table in<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>front of his shop, to be sold at fifteen cents each. They did<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>not prove very sellers. For almost three weeks they<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>were out there in rain and shine, and nobody seemed to be<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>attracted enough to take them home.

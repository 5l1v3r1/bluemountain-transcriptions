But no chronicler has ever told the name<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>of the grave-digger. Hidden away in the records of the Title<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>Guarantee &amp; Trust Company is his name. Daniel Magie. And<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>more than the name is the interesting fact that in 1819 he<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>purchased from John Ireland, one of the big merchants, the<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>corner plot, now 58 Washington Square South, 21 x 80 feet,<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>the same dimensions to-day. For this little plot $500 was<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>paid, and there very likely, Mr. Megie built a wooden shack,<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>where he could keep his wooden tools and sleep.<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>The potter's field had formerly been on Union Square. A<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>little before 1819 the latter was fitted up more appropriately<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>as a park, and the potter's burying ground moved westward<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>to Washington Square, then an out-of-the-way part of the<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>city. For three years Daniel Megie held the official position<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>of keeper of the potter's field, and as such his name appears<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>in the directories of 1819, 1820 and 1821. Then the square was<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>abandoned as a burial place and the potter's field moved<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>northward again to Bryant Park. Mr. Megie by this change<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>evidently lost his job, for in 1821 he sold his Washington<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>Square corner to Joseph Dean, and two years later the latter<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>sold it for $850. It was about ten years later before prices<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>showed any great advance. Then fashion captured the park,<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>and. despite the enormous growth northward, the aroma of<lb facs="P11_TL00048"/>fashion still nermeates the square, and the fine old fashioned<lb facs="P11_TL00049"/>houses on the north side continue to be occupied by some<lb facs="P11_TL00050"/>of the first families of the city.<lb facs="P11_TL00051"/>It is a singular fact and one that the old real estate rec<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

It is still covered for its depth of eighty feet with<lb facs="P11_TL00054"/>two-story wooden buildings, the corner being an ice cream<lb facs="P11_TL00055"/>store, and they present a decidedly incongruous appearance<lb facs="P11_TL00056"/>by the side of the fine old houses adjoining.</ab>

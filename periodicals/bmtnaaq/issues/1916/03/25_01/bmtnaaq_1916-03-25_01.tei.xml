                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00007"/>The idea of honour is associated with war. But to whom does<lb facs="P3_TL00008"/>the honour belong? If to any, certainly not to the mass of the<lb facs="P3_TL00009"/>people, but to those ivho are particularly engaged in it. The mass<lb facs="P3_TL00010"/>of a people, ivho stay at home and hire others to fight, who sleep<lb facs="P3_TL00011"/>in their warm beds and hire others to sleep on the cold and damp<lb facs="P3_TL00012"/>earth, who sit at their well spread board and hire others to take<lb facs="P3_TL00013"/>the chance of starving, who nurse the slightest hurt in their own&gt;<lb facs="P3_TL00014"/>bodies and hire others to expose themselves to mortal wounds, and .<lb facs="P3_TL00015"/>to linger in comfortless hospitals, certainly this mass reap little<lb facs="P3_TL00016"/>honour from war. The honour belongs to those who immediately<lb facs="P3_TL00017"/>engage in it. Let me ask, then, what is the chief business of wart<lb facs="P3_TL00018"/>It is to destroy human life, to mangle the limbs, to gash and hew<lb facs="P3_TL00019"/>the body, to plunge the sword into the heart of a fellow-creature, to<lb facs="P3_TL00020"/>strew the earth with bleeding frames, and to trample them under<lb facs="P3_TL00021"/>foot with horses' hoofs. It is to batter down and burn cities, to turn<lb facs="P3_TL00022"/>fruitful fields into deserts, to level the cottage of the peasant, and<lb facs="P3_TL00023"/>the magnificent abode of opulence, to siourge nations with famine,<lb facs="P3_TL00024"/>to multiply widows and orphans. Are these honourable deeds?<lb facs="P3_TL00025"/>Were you called to name exploits worthy of demons, would you<lb facs="P3_TL00026"/>not naturally select such as these? Grant that a necessity for them<lb facs="P3_TL00027"/>may exist.

IVe have thought that it was<lb facs="P3_TL00030"/>honourable to heal, to save, to mitigate pain, to snatch the sick and<lb facs="P3_TL00031"/>sinking from the jaws of death.

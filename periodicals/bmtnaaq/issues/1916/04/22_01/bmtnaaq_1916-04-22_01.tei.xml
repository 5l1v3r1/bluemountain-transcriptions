It is an assurance that death does not rule the world.<lb facs="P3_TL00008"/>We need it, viewing the wide welter of war, Those dead over<lb facs="P3_TL00009"/>there died for something beyond death and the life they so freely<lb facs="P3_TL00010"/>gave. They die that other men may live, that certain ideals,<lb facs="P3_TL00011"/>however dimly or distortedly conceived, may have assurance of<lb facs="P3_TL00012"/>■ persistence. They die, too, at the urge of mighty forces using them<lb facs="P3_TL00013"/>for ends we must believe are good. Do we not see that Life burns<lb facs="P3_TL00014"/>brighter for the mighty orgy of Death? Is there not sensibly a<lb facs="P3_TL00015"/>spiritual quickening of men before the tragedy of the dozen nations<lb facs="P3_TL00016"/>sworn to slaughter? Is not Pity succeeding Rage, and Hate in its<lb facs="P3_TL00017"/>own futility engendering Love? IVhen truly was the world, more<lb facs="P3_TL00018"/>desirous of peace than now, when war figs purged its,spirit through<lb facs="P3_TL00019"/>its horrors? How many evils this war will sweep, away! An old<lb facs="P3_TL00020"/>world is dying in*blood. A new world is being born in cataclysmic<lb facs="P3_TL00021"/>travail. The old earth has come through mat?v wars and to<lb facs="P3_TL00022"/>betterment. The race of man has learned through suffering. It<lb facs="P3_TL00023"/>has forgot and has had to learn again and more. Death perpetually<lb facs="P3_TL00024"/>renews Life. And Love wields both in interplay, The tieoPles will<lb facs="P3_TL00025"/>be nearer one another for this present madness, If we believe not<lb facs="P3_TL00026"/>this, the universe is . a madhouse and the law of being is the<lb facs="P3_TL00027"/>emanation of an Infinite Idiot. The millennium is yet far off.<lb facs="P3_TL00028"/>There will be other wars, other purifications by fire and blood.<lb facs="P3_TL00029"/>A God, they say, died for us. We shall have to die often for the<lb facs="P3_TL00030"/>God within ourselves, till all but the God shall-remain dead and<lb facs="P3_TL00031"/>then His kingdom come. There shall be myriads of Ea*tzrs ere<lb facs="P3_TL00032"/>the agonies be done,- if ever. And endless loveliness of recurring<lb facs="P3_TL00033"/>Springs "with that nameless pathos in the air" for all that die that<lb facs="P3_TL00034"/>Spring may come to be. 1 •&gt; • '</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00003"/>on the Odthout Farm, where her grandfather had rented<lb facs="P4_TL00004"/>house to take his family out of the reach of cholera, the<lb facs="P4_TL00005"/>prevalent in the city. She was born on the third of Augus<lb facs="P4_TL00006"/>1819—a contemporary of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria. He<lb facs="P4_TL00007"/>birthplace was a frame house with hip roof. In after year<lb facs="P4_TL00008"/>a brick front was put on and the hip roof was straightene<lb facs="P4_TL00009"/>up with bricks. The house was divided into two, and becam<lb facs="P4_TL00010"/>either 32 and 34 West Twentieth, Street, or 34 and 36—I at<lb facs="P4_TL00011"/>not sure which. Only a dozen year ago, when business mad<lb facs="P4_TL00012"/>its inroads into that section, I discovered workmen razin<lb facs="P4_TL00013"/>the building, and the next one having been previously de<lb facs="P4_TL00014"/>molished, I could see the outline of the old roof and som<lb facs="P4_TL00015"/>of the original clapboards. Much to the amazement of th<lb facs="P4_TL00016"/>laborers I asked for and secured some pieces of these clap<lb facs="P4_TL00017"/>boards and distributed sections of them at our family dinne<lb facs="P4_TL00018"/>table on the next Thanskgiving Day. My mother grew u<lb facs="P4_TL00019"/>at the corner of Fulton and Nassau Streets, her father beinj<lb facs="P4_TL00020"/>the Rev. John Knox, D.D., whose pastorate of forty year<lb facs="P4_TL00021"/>was in the Collegiate Dutch Church. She often visited ii<lb facs="P4_TL00022"/>Greenwich Village, both at her grandfather's and at the hom<lb facs="P4_TL00023"/>of Mr. Abraham Van Nest, which had been built an&lt;<lb facs="P4_TL00024"/>originally occupied by Sir Peter Warren. But she neve<lb facs="P4_TL00025"/>thought of going so far for less than a week! There was ;<lb facs="P4_TL00026"/>city conveyance for part of the way, and then the old Green<lb facs="P4_TL00027"/>wich stage enabled them to complete the long iournev. Thi<lb facs="P4_TL00028"/>ran several times a day, and when my mother committed he<lb facs="P4_TL00029"/>hymn,<lb facs="P4_TL00030"/>"Hasten, sinner, to be wise<lb facs="P4_TL00031"/>Ere this evening's stage be run,"<lb facs="P4_TL00032"/>she told us that for some years it never occurred to her tha<lb facs="P4_TL00033"/>it could mean anything in the world but the Greenwich stage<lb facs="P4_TL00034"/>Mr. Van Nest's house was as dear to my young days as t&lt;<lb facs="P4_TL00035"/>those of my mother. It was a square frame house on ;<lb facs="P4_TL00036"/>slight elevation in the midst of land bounded by Fourth an&lt;<lb facs="P4_TL00037"/>Bleecker, Charles and Perry Streets. It was the countn<lb facs="P4_TL00038"/>residence of a gentleman, with flower and vegetable gardens<lb facs="P4_TL00039"/>a stable, a cow, chickens, pigeons and a peacock, all dear t&lt;<lb facs="P4_TL00040"/>childish hearts. And likewise „<lb facs="P4_TL00041"/>"In that mansion used to be<lb facs="P4_TL00042"/>Free-hearted hospitality."<lb facs="P4_TL00043"/>From its doors many children had married and gone fortl<lb facs="P4_TL00044"/>before my time came, and the mother I never knew.

A large hall ran througl<lb facs="P4_TL00051"/>the house and a large mahogany table stood there, and thi:<lb facs="P4_TL00052"/>was always furnished with a large silver cake-basket full o<lb facs="P4_TL00053"/>declicious sponge-cake, a batch of which must have beer<lb facs="P4_TL00054"/>made every morning, I am sure, by the colored cook.

A party dress then was—l<lb facs="P5_TL00008"/>remember one such very distinctly from my pride in its<lb facs="P5_TL00009"/>acquisition—a red merino, short enough to show the white<lb facs="P5_TL00010"/>pantalettes which went down to our ankles, and over it a<lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>dotted Swiss muslin apron with straps over the shoulders.<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>And we felt just as fine as the more bedizened little creatures<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>of to-day—and I yield to no generations, before our days<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>or since, in the good times we had.<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>It was in 1843 that my mother married, her father then<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>being resident at the corner of Fourth and Mercer Streets.<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>There I was born in 1844, and when I was two months old<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>I was carried to her home, where I still reside. This is<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>in Thirteenth Street, west of Sixth Avenue. There was a<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>drug store, kept by Mrs. M. Giles, on the corner, and beyond<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>that lot began a row of dwelling houses of which my father<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>bought the fifth, but latterly business has absorbed four of<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>these, so that we are now the first residence on the block. It<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>was very far uptown in those days—there is a letter still<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>extant which predicts that my mother will never see her<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>old friends for they cannot go so far up—and it was thought<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>very narrow,, being only twenty feet wide. Oilcloth was in<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>those days laid in the halls, but my grandfather advised<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>against it, saying, "Throw down a strip of carpet, Helen:<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>you won't stay here five years." She Stayed sixty-five, until<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>she was within two months of ninety years, when she went<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>to her home above. Nine children were born there, one of<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>whom made a brief stay in this world—but eight of us grew<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>up, four boys and four girls, a natural, wholesome, noisy,<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>merry set of youngsters, whose old-fashioned ways would<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>doubtless amaze the succeeding generations. Just to mention<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>one thing—no Sunday paper has ever been delivered at our<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>door.<lb facs="P5_TL00039"/>The location, considered from a sanitary point of view, has<lb facs="P5_TL00040"/>always been excellent; in fact, it was a knowledge of this that<lb facs="P5_TL00041"/>determined its choice. The Croton water was in the house,<lb facs="P5_TL00042"/>and even a bath-tub, but no stationary tubs for a good many<lb facs="P5_TL00043"/>years and well do I remember seeing the maids on Monday<lb facs="P5_TL00044"/>afternoon carrying out the round tubs and emptying thein<lb facs="P5_TL00045"/>into the gutter, and great was our glee if the water soused<lb facs="P5_TL00046"/>a great black pig from its siesta—for these creatures roamed<lb facs="P5_TL00047"/>at large and were the only scavengers of any consequence.<lb facs="P5_TL00048"/>Well do I remember also the introduction of gas and how<lb facs="P5_TL00049"/>we followed our father from room to roo'm as he triumphantly<lb facs="P5_TL00050"/>lit each burner. It was a frolic after that on winter evenings<lb facs="P5_TL00051"/>to shuffle across the carpet and light the gas with an electric<lb facs="P5_TL00052"/>spark from the tips of our fingers, I being the one most<lb facs="P5_TL00053"/>usually successful in this feat.</ab>

The baron<lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>knows he will have to be well protected and for the first time<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>he seeks shelter in Chihuahua from individual assassins.<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>Urquidi takes him to the house of Gonzales de la Garza,<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>who is later to become one of Mexico's presidents for a few<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>days' appearanec only. De la Garza is kind and gives the<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>proper refuge.<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>" The next day it is Juarez and across the border.<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>Von Kriegelstein is written up in Chicago as he goes<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>through. '<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>Consequently lie must get some kind of a paper, probably<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>an American passport to get him over to Europe. Well, at<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>any rate we said good bye and although the British cruisers<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>searched the steamer he was on—well what can one or two<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>ordinary humans do with a man who talks so many languages.<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>But because he was von Kriegelstein I kept thinking of<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>him after he had gone. Then came the news of his death,<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>as he should have died facing the Russians whom he hated<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>and wrote against-. The sun of his profession has set, but the<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>star of von Kriegelstein is rising. Like most he will be best<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>known long after he is dead because he has left his books<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>to speak for him. </ab>

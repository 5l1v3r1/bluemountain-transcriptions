                                    <lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>in the long grass on the slope of my garden is an<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>ancient coffin. It is old and weatherbeaten and the<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>planks of it are so warped and twisted that when I pass by<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>I can look through the large cracks to the inner blackness<lb facs="P11_TL00020"/>and see the poor, dead bones, white and still. It lies at the<lb facs="P11_TL00021"/>foot of a willow tree, and in summer it is covered with the<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>mass of trailing green branches which hang over it like a<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>pall. My friends do not like graves in their gardens, and<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>think I should have the old coffin taken away.<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>But why should I disturb the dead? There is so much room<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>for us both, and I think the Willow Tree would die, for I<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>know she loves the soul of him whose bones lie in the old<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>coffin—she bends over so tenderly, and lets fall all of her<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>lovely hair to protect his narrow, ruined house from the sun<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>and rain.<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>On certain days a very old man used to come and burn<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>incense by this grave, and sitting in the long grass beneath<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>the tree he would chant Buddist rites, but he was so old, and<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>his voice was so cracked, it was but a piteous croaking. He<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>has not been for many weeks now, and the soul of the dead<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>is grieved. Often at night I hear it crying softly to itself,<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>and the wind sighs in the Willow Tree. But the Tsing Ming<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>Dzieh (Day to Honor the Dead) will soon be here, and the<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>old man will surely come then to chant his little songs to<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>the old coffin.<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>Today is the Tsing Ming Dzieh. Since dawn the people<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>have passed between the rice fields and over the country<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>roads.

This is the day when the Living bow<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>down and worship, and pay tribute to the Dead.<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>But no one has come this year to the grave on my garden<lb facs="P11_TL00048"/>slope.

It was nearly a year after my arrival<lb facs="P3_TL00033"/>in the United States. I had just finished reading the writings<lb facs="P3_TL00034"/>of Abraham Lincoln. I wanted to be a citizen of the country<lb facs="P3_TL00035"/>this man had lived and worked and finally died for.<lb facs="P3_TL00036"/>Hero worship! But how I would wish to be as young<lb facs="P3_TL00037"/>again! My ideals carried me with uncurtailed wings high<lb facs="P3_TL00038"/>above all material mattersâ€”above disappointments not spared<lb facs="P3_TL00039"/>to any of us, and all those little disasters which are part of<lb facs="P3_TL00040"/>our lives.<lb facs="P3_TL00041"/>I had admired Alexander the Great; Napoleon had been<lb facs="P3_TL00042"/>my ideal for years. Power, strength, determination of will,<lb facs="P3_TL00043"/>making other people do what he thought was best for them,â€”<lb facs="P3_TL00044"/>that had impressed me. To read the lives of these men, to<lb facs="P3_TL00045"/>study their methods and their actions brought me elevation<lb facs="P3_TL00046"/>and gave me ambition.</ab>

Liberte! Egalite! Fraternite!<lb facs="P4_TL00007"/>I searched for it in France and I could not find it. Maybe<lb facs="P4_TL00008"/>I was too young in those days; maybe I was not able to *<lb facs="P4_TL00009"/>translate the ideal into existing conditions.

Work that<lb facs="P4_TL00025"/>anybody could do who had strength and physical ability,<lb facs="P4_TL00026"/>where there were no questions asked, no contracts made. I<lb facs="P4_TL00027"/>came in the morning and received my pay in the evening, if<lb facs="P4_TL00028"/>I wished to. If I didn't like the work, I could quit it. And<lb facs="P4_TL00029"/>while I was working to earn my room and board, my thoughts<lb facs="P4_TL00030"/>were my own. And never in my life did I feel freer than in<lb facs="P4_TL00031"/>those days in which I had exchanged my pen for a shovel.<lb facs="P4_TL00032"/>I frequented the libraries. In my work clothes I strolled<lb facs="P4_TL00033"/>in, asked for any book I wished to read. Can you recollect<lb facs="P4_TL00034"/>the red tape you have to go through if you ask for a book<lb facs="P4_TL00035"/>in the library in France, in Germany or in Italy? Not the<lb facs="P4_TL00036"/>big tragedies of life made for unhappiness, but the small,<lb facs="P4_TL00037"/>little annoyances spoil for us the pleasure of enjoying this<lb facs="P4_TL00038"/>world.<lb facs="P4_TL00039"/>"I do the very best I know how, the very best I can, and<lb facs="P4_TL00040"/>mean to keep doing so 'til the end.

He had been far above the criticism<lb facs="P4_TL00048"/>of his time; he had seen only one goal for his life, one path<lb facs="P4_TL00049"/>leading to this goal, and he walked-this path. He saw the<lb facs="P4_TL00050"/>ambushes; he anticipated the stones which would be hurled<lb facs="P4_TL00051"/>at him from behind, but he walked on.

In the<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>clerk's office while I was looking at the disinterested face<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>of the man who wanted me to raise my hand and repeat the<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>oath and to be done with me. I saw myself as a young boy<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>singing patriotic songs. I saw myself as a youth in uniform<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>with unsheathed sword swearing an oath of allegiance to<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>my king. How terrible that oath was!

For this little plot $500 was<lb facs="P31_TL00056"/>paid, and there very likely, Mr. Megie built a wooden shack,<lb facs="P31_TL00057"/>where he could keep his wooden tools and sleep.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P32_TL00003"/>The potter's field had formerly been on Union Square. A<lb facs="P32_TL00004"/>little before 1819 the latter was fitted up more appropriately<lb facs="P32_TL00005"/>as a park, and the potter's burying ground moved westward<lb facs="P32_TL00006"/>to Washington Square, then an out-of-the-way part of the<lb facs="P32_TL00007"/>city. For three years Daniel Megie held the official position<lb facs="P32_TL00008"/>of keeper of the potter's field, and as such his name appears<lb facs="P32_TL00009"/>in the directories of 1819, 1820 and 1821. Then the square was<lb facs="P32_TL00010"/>abandoned as a burial place and the potter's field moved<lb facs="P32_TL00011"/>northward again to Bryant Park. Mr. Megie by this change<lb facs="P32_TL00012"/>evidently lost his job, for in 1821 he sold his Washington<lb facs="P32_TL00013"/>Square corner to Joseph Dean, and two years later the latter<lb facs="P32_TL00014"/>sold it for $850. It was about ten years later before prices<lb facs="P32_TL00015"/>showed any great advance.

The fifty foot plot adjoining<lb facs="P32_TL00038"/>the corner is now occupied by two fine old houses similar in<lb facs="P32_TL00039"/>architecture to those on the north side of the square.

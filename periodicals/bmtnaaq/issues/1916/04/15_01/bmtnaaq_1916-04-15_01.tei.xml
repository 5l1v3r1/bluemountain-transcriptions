We need but recall<lb facs="P4_TL00007"/>the tragedies since the war started. Think of the many lives<lb facs="P4_TL00008"/>and millions of dollars worth of property buried beneath the<lb facs="P4_TL00009"/>ruins of San Francisco and the hundreds of thousands of<lb facs="P4_TL00010"/>victims of the present war.<lb facs="P4_TL00011"/>And each time there awakes amid the horror of such<lb facs="P4_TL00012"/>tragedies the same heroism of olden times.

Our poets do not sing the praise of these<lb facs="P4_TL00016"/>heroes. They turn their eyes from the sinking city.<lb facs="P4_TL00017"/>They do not spar with the envious wizards of the inner<lb facs="P4_TL00018"/>earth, who vent in terrific cataclysms their jealousy of happy<lb facs="P4_TL00019"/>people. They do not reach in despair with the drowning for<lb facs="P4_TL00020"/>the splintered mast, with the fighting for new strength.<lb facs="P4_TL00021"/>And yet, are not these very subjects rich enough in grandeur<lb facs="P4_TL00022"/>to inspire the artistic soul to the most fantastic dreams?<lb facs="P4_TL00023"/>Dreaming?<lb facs="P4_TL00024"/>Yes; there is the point.

There is<lb facs="P4_TL00030"/>made to hover over the grim region, where death harvested,<lb facs="P4_TL00031"/>no fanciful twilight whose outlines are hazy.

Because of it the catastrophe<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>of to-day is not followed by poesy. We are robbed of the<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>faculty of seeing with our own inner eyes and are compelled<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>to look at everything as thousands of others about us see the<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>same. There is stolen from the disaster and the heroic deed<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>of unselfishness the romance, without which we cannot feel<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>poetically.<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>And so we may say unhesitatingly: What is clicked over<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>the wires is lost for Art.</ab>

On that day the hills of Fiesole were<lb facs="P5_TL00039"/>patched with snow, as if some mighty visitor from the North<lb facs="P5_TL00040"/>had left the impress of his powdered sole. Through my<lb facs="P5_TL00041"/>southern window the little oval English cemetery intercepted<lb facs="P5_TL00042"/>my view. The naked trees, like imploring hands clawed the<lb facs="P5_TL00043"/>cheerless heavens for a ray of kindly warmth. Salvini knocked<lb facs="P5_TL00044"/>at my door at about ten in the morning. He refused to take<lb facs="P5_TL00045"/>off his large heavy bat-winged coat. The thermometer<lb facs="P5_TL00046"/>registered about 55 degrees F. My big fat tin drum stove<lb facs="P5_TL00047"/>was very useless on that day as on all other days. The more<lb facs="P5_TL00048"/>wood I fed it, the less it worked. It seemed to grow stubborn.<lb facs="P5_TL00049"/>The ashes that formed within its body, choked it. It was<lb facs="P5_TL00050"/>sorrow-bound for four cold months.

It was essentially an actor's home, crowded<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>with souvenirs. I remember him reading to me in his ground<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>floor room; that was sixteen years ago on a bright morning<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>in early Spring when life had returned on the breath of a<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>soft message from Aeolus. /<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>Perhaps Salvini's friendship for me was very sincere be<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

And after the<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>moon had risen I went again unto him for an answer. And<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>he replied, saying: "Oh ye of little faith!

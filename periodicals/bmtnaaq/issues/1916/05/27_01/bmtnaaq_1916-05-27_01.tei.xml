Fred Funston, a little sawed-off chap,<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>came to New \ ork from the wild and woolly west, looking<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>for a job. He was broke and so was I. My meanderingsi<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>took me down to Harper's Weekly, then a. publication of<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>weight and merit, and to its amiable managing editor I<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>sold some of my literary vaporings. Then I landed a job.<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>It was to go to Cuba and write war stuff.<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>Following closely upon my heels, Fred Funston landed two<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>jobs. New \ork was then rife with Cuban patriotism, and<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>stories of Spanish cruelty and oppression, sufficient to make<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>any red-blooded man's bipod boil, and there was hardly one<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>of us who did not want to go down to Cuba and help lick<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>those Spaniards. We all were willing to fight for a cause,<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>and the Cuban cause seemed a good one.<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>Fred being of the right stuff, and his blood fired by tales<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>of Cuba's struggle for freedom, offered his services, not<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>having any sword to offer, to the Cuban Junta at their offices<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>down in New Street. One of the bunch of Cuban generals,<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>sizing him up, and not wanting to hurt his feelings, told him<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>that they were not sending any more to Cuba,<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>bu the office boy, being a good American and not a very large<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>man himself, tipped Funston off that an expedition was being<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>fitted out for Cuba with a couple of Hotchkiss field pieces,<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>and that there was not a damned Cuban in the whole cigar<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>making oufit, that was being sent down to the island to fight<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>for his liberty, who knew a gun from a water main.<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>That was enough for Freddie. All he had to do was to<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>ascertain who sold those guns, and the office boy informing<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>him, away he hiked up to Hartley and Graham's on Broad<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>way, and boldly announced that he was going to Cuba; for<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>men with red blood, when they make up their minds to do a<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>thing, usually do it. He may have stretched a point or<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>two, but that does not matter. He was shown the twelve<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>pounder that was being purchased for the Cuban, expedition.<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>An expert explained its mechanism, and he was allowed to<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>fondly handle the formidable looking piece, take it apart and<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>put it together again, and half an hour's instruction was<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>given him in finding the range, priming, firing, etc. When<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>Funston returned to the Junta, he was theoretically a full<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>fledged artilleryman, and so anxious was the Cuban "general<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>to whom he applied for service in the Cuban army this time,<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>to secure a gunner for the field pieces that were being sent to<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>Cuba, that it did not occur to him to size up the applicant's<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>soldierly looking qualities, and the little sawed-off future<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>general was engaged at once.

And thus with two jobs, the war-like<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>hobo from the West, embarked for Cuba and began his<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>military careet which has landed him in the United States<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>Army with the rank of Major-General.<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>He made good in Cuba as far as the Cuban artillery was<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>concerned. For with the very field piece which he was<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>allowed, to so fondly handle in New York, he knocked the<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>spots out of the Spanish block-house at Cascorra, helped take<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>the town of Guaimaro, peppered the town and fortifications<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>ot Jiguani, and finally blew up the Infantry barracks of Las<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>Tunas and helped beat that town into surrender. But by<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>this time, the Cuban army had exhausted itself. The country<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>was without food, and the followers of Carlixto Garcia were<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>literally starving. Funston starved with them until there was<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>nothing else to do, and he did itâ€”one of the nerviest things in<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>his life.<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>He rode up to a Spanish blockhouse and surrendered. The<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>Spaniards, instead of cutting his throat, as he expected they<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>would do, and as he deserved, took him in, fed him and sent<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>him to Havana, where he was turned over to Consul General<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>Fitzhugh Lee, and sent back to New \ork, broke again.<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>Here he had his Harper's Weekly job in reserve. He wrote<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>"The Battle of La Machuca," and that provided him with<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>funds to travel homeward, where upon the strength of his<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>military career in Cuba, he was appointed Colonel of the<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>Twentieth (Kansas) Volunteers.</ab>

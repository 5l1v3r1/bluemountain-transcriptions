He is proud of the fact<lb facs="P3_TL00026"/>that he is pure Kelt and without intermixture for as far back<lb facs="P3_TL00027"/>as he knows. Till he was twelve years of age, he wis<lb facs="P3_TL00028"/>educated in Ireland, the last year or so at the Royal School,<lb facs="P3_TL00029"/>Armagh. In spite of his ultra-protestant or Black Orange<lb facs="P3_TL00030"/>relations, Frank Harris still recounts with glee how he was<lb facs="P3_TL00031"/>a Fenian even before he could think. "As a small boy," he<lb facs="P3_TL00032"/>says,; "I remember reading a proclamation offering five<lb facs="P3_TL00033"/>thousand pounds for anv information that wo"M lead to the<lb facs="P3_TL00034"/>arrest of James Stephens,the Fenian Head-Centre. While<lb facs="P3_TL00035"/>my playmates were gloating over the idea of getting this<lb facs="P3_TL00036"/>large sum of money I was only thinking how I could help<lb facs="P3_TL00037"/>him away from the 'polis.' The 'Head-Centre' fascinated<lb facs="P3_TL00038"/>my fancy!"<lb facs="P3_TL00039"/>At twelve, his father sent him as a boarder to a well-known<lb facs="P3_TL00040"/>public school on the Welsh border. There, for the first time<lb facs="P3_TL00041"/>he met English boys and English sentiment. The school<lb facs="P3_TL00042"/>horsefed him; it was all punishments, he says, nothing human<lb facs="P3_TL00043"/>or humane about it except the library. He read madly<lb facs="P3_TL00044"/>morning, noon and night till he knew Scott almost by heart<lb facs="P3_TL00045"/>Charlotte Bronte, Mrs. Gstskell, Thackerary and Reade—^aha</ab>

After reading every<lb facs="P4_TL00004"/>other novel in the library he read Dickens and the poets.<lb facs="P4_TL00005"/>The fagging system in the school was abhorrent to this<lb facs="P4_TL00006"/>born rebel; he fought it tooth and nail; but in spite of trouble<lb facs="P4_TL00007"/>with boys as well as with the masters, he won prize after<lb facs="P4_TL00008"/>prize.<lb facs="P4_TL00009"/>At fourteen his father disappointed him by failing to give<lb facs="P4_TL00010"/>him the nomination to become midshipman in the British<lb facs="P4_TL00011"/>Navy and the t boy resolved to run away. For weeks he<lb facs="P4_TL00012"/>weighed the charms of South Africa (where they had just<lb facs="P4_TL00013"/>discovered diamonds) with those of Western America and<lb facs="P4_TL00014"/>at length he decided in favor of the Wild West. He came<lb facs="P4_TL00015"/>to America and soon made his way to Kansas and drove<lb facs="P4_TL00016"/>on the trail as a cowboy to New Mexico. He always declares<lb facs="P4_TL00017"/>that whatever capacity of thought he possesses comes from<lb facs="P4_TL00018"/>the fact that while his mind was growing he had to solve all<lb facs="P4_TL00019"/>the modern problems for himself and without books. "I<lb facs="P4_TL00020"/>think first and read afterwards" is his motto.<lb facs="P4_TL00021"/>After a couple of years of wild Western life, skirmishes<lb facs="P4_TL00022"/>with Indians, mad gamblings, ups and downs of fortune, he<lb facs="P4_TL00023"/>met the man Byron Smith, Professor of Greek, in the Uni<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00024"/>versity of Kansas. Professor Smith persuaded him to become<lb facs="P4_TL00025"/>a student and he spent the next three years with his mentor<lb facs="P4_TL00026"/>and friend at Lawrence, Kansas. When Professor Smith<lb facs="P4_TL00027"/>left the University for his health, Harris quarreled at once<lb facs="P4_TL00028"/>with the authorities, refusing to come into morning chapel,<lb facs="P4_TL00029"/>and left the University in turn and went on with his law<lb facs="P4_TL00030"/>studies. Indue time he was admitted to the bar and began<lb facs="P4_TL00031"/>the practice of law.<lb facs="P4_TL00032"/>A year later Smith grew worse in Philadelphia and Harris<lb facs="P4_TL00033"/>threw up everything and went East to be with him. In<lb facs="P4_TL00034"/>another year his friend died and Harris returned to Europe<lb facs="P4_TL00035"/>to study; first in Paris, later in Heidelberg, Gottingen and<lb facs="P4_TL00036"/>Berlin. Then he went from Berlin to Athens where he<lb facs="P4_TL00037"/>studied a year. On his way back to America he met Froude<lb facs="P4_TL00038"/>in London and gave him a letter of introduction from<lb facs="P4_TL00039"/>Carlyle. Almost immediately he was offered the editorship of<lb facs="P4_TL00040"/>the "London Evening News" which he brought to success.<lb facs="P4_TL00041"/>Then he was offered the editorship of "The Fortnightly<lb facs="P4_TL00042"/>Review" which John (now Lord) Morley had just resigned.<lb facs="P4_TL00043"/>Seven years later he bought "The Saturday Review" and<lb facs="P4_TL00044"/>made it ever famous among English papers by bringing<lb facs="P4_TL00045"/>Bernard Shaw on it to write about the theatre; Wells to<lb facs="P4_TL00046"/>review the novels; D. S. McColl (now the head of the Tait<lb facs="P4_TL00047"/>Gallery) to write on art; Dr. Chalmers Mitchell, now the<lb facs="P4_TL00048"/>head of the Zoological Society, to write on Science; Max Beer<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

It is hardly too much to say that Harris picked then,<lb facs="P4_TL00052"/>in 1894, nearly all the men who to-day form public opinion<lb facs="P4_TL00053"/>in Great Britain.

The<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>''Vampire" in grey silk had just paid him another visit and<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>had left him drained of strength and hope, exhausted, enerved,<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>panting.

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>sion at least that he was getting better. The effort cost him<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>more than life. He returned to Cannes by train, and at two<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>the next morning Francois heard him ringing and hurried to<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>his bedside, only to find him streaming in blood and out of<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>his mind, crying—"Au rancart! Au rancart!"<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>To-day I went through the little, low, two-storied villa, and<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>sat where he had sat, and walked where he had walked. Here,<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>on this raised, half-moon terrace, on that bright, clear day,<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>with the sunshine sparkling over there on the red roofs and<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>the blue sea he had always taken such pleasure in; here he<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>stood, another Anthony, and fought a.more terrible fight than<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>the Roman ever imagined. I had seen him a month before,<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>and had had a long, intimate talk with him which cannot be<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>set down in these pages; but it enables me to picture him as<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>he was on that fatal morning. He had taken Francois with<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>him to cook his food; he meant to give himself every chance<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>of winning in the fight, and now, the meal over, the strain<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>of talking and pretending grew intolerable, and he came out<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>here by himself, with only the blue, unheeding sky above<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>and the purple, dancing sea in front to mock his agony.</ab>

And if his betrothed<lb facs="P12_TL00043"/>would have only the slightest inkling of a conscience and<lb facs="P12_TL00044"/>recognize that it was she who had caused his downfall, her<lb facs="P12_TL00045"/>tortures would be terrible. At the same time he wished to<lb facs="P12_TL00046"/>combine the pleasant with the useful and to have as good a<lb facs="P12_TL00047"/>time as he could. Therefore he chose the profession of a<lb facs="P12_TL00048"/>crook and started upon his new activities by entering an auto<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

He introduced himself as Mr. Rich, day laborer, and<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>a?ked for a loan of ten thousand dollars. But here, too, the<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>result of his expedition was very sad. The manager of the<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>bank gave him even a lackey who should show him out of the<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>building. But that was all he was willing to give him.<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>In the meantime, his monthly room rent became due. Mr.<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>Rich was not able to pay and informed Mrs. Mclntyre, the<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>keeper of his boarding house to that effect. He assured her<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>at the same time, that he was willing to take from now on<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>in addition to the breakfasts included in his rental, dinner and<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>supper with her.

All four flights at once. His possessions<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>she forwarded to the sidewalk where he had landed, through<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>the window.<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>"It's just my luck," he philosophized.

But nothing<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>came. Mr. Rich, day laborer, remained an honest man. Even<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>the cooks wouldn't give him anything.

As<lb facs="P14_TL00007"/>I worked I notice a small black bird hopping about among<lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>the violets—iand every once in a while he would leave his<lb facs="P14_TL00009"/>hunt and fly up onto a branch and sing—I never heard a bird<lb facs="P14_TL00010"/>sing so gloriously, not even a nightingale at home, for this<lb facs="P14_TL00011"/>was no lament, but a song of joy and triumph.<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>Professor Meigs came out after a while to watch me daub<lb facs="P14_TL00013"/>and he told me about the little black bird. He is a robin, a<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>jet black robin, and he glistens like fine lacquer. He is<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>smaller than an American robin, but larger than an English<lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>one, and he sings to beat both. He has just the same jaunty<lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>hop, and impertinent thrust of the head, just the same quick<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>jab after a worm, and the bracing of his black legs wfien he<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>gets it. He is a very rare bird, even here, but this one comes<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>every year to the Meighs garden, and they think a great deal<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>of him.

Little Roma entered shyly, tiptoeing around and<lb facs="P16_TL00010"/>casting glances about her. As she saw that he was respectful<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>and embarrased, she gradually became reassured enough to<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>sit by him on the divan.

She was intelligent in her admiration, recognizing<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>some volumes like those she had seen at her father's. She<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>looked through his papers, too, and read a few scattered notes<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>here and there, and wondered at two or three phrases.<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>"Have you written this?"<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>"Certainly.

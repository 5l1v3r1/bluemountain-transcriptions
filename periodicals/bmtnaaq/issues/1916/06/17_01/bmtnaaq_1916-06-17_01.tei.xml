And then<lb facs="P5_TL00008"/>he started out. He transported his little army at first on<lb facs="P5_TL00009"/>a primitive railroad and then he shipped them like an<lb facs="P5_TL00010"/>assembly of tourists in steamers belonging to Cook and<lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>Son, to Assuan and from there to Akasha. Four thousand<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>camels with provender and munitions and five thousand<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>working men accompanied him. Of course, he built at<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>the same time a railroad. And soon afterwards it was<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>possible to travel along the same route in as many hours<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>as formerly it had taken days.<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>The military successes were in no way extraordinary.<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>The talent of a military leader was not required to an<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

And so Kitchener decided<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>to build a railroad.

Every drop of water had to be carried, every<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>pound of biscuit had to be obtained in Cairo; flour he<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>brought from Russia; machines he ordered from England<lb facs="P5_TL00039"/>and locomotives from America. And that was how he<lb facs="P5_TL00040"/>built a railroad.<lb facs="P5_TL00041"/>It was his main piece of work there because the battle<lb facs="P5_TL00042"/>of Omdurman, terrible as it was from the standpoint of<lb facs="P5_TL00043"/>a military leader, was child's play. Notwithstanding a<lb facs="P5_TL00044"/>sure death the Dervishes in their white burnouses made<lb facs="P5_TL00045"/>an attack and were shot down by the new machine guns—<lb facs="P5_TL00046"/>thousands, even tens of thousands at once.

The laughter<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>of all England was aroused when he was offered the<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>directorship of the London and Chatham Dover Railway<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>Co. But finally in 1911 he was made British Agent and<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>First Consul in Egypt. Here he was given the power<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>of a Viceroy. At the time England took part in the<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>European war, Kitchener was made secretary of the<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>Colonies, and he who knows the methods of his colonial<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>wars will find very easily his directing power in the whole<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>English strategy of the present war.<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>Kitchener had a well-formed face with a high forehead,<lb facs="P6_TL00054"/>his hair parted, enormous eyebrows overshadowed his eyes<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>which were as clear as water and passionless. Under his<lb facs="P6_TL00056"/>straight and strong nose was a big moustache. His cheeks<lb facs="P6_TL00057"/>were always very red, dried by twenty-five years of desert'<lb facs="P6_TL00058"/>sun. He never laughed and only spoke if he had to. He<lb facs="P6_TL00059"/>was a lonely domineering man of gnashing sharpness,<lb facs="P6_TL00060"/>phonetically indicated in his name; without wife, without<lb facs="P6_TL00061"/>relatives, without a friend.

He loves<lb facs="P6_TL00082"/>flowers and birds, God's Nature, whose messengers they<lb facs="P6_TL00083"/>are. He longs for forests and for mountains. His lungs<lb facs="P6_TL00084"/>are thirsty for the pure air of Nature. The greatest poets<lb facs="P6_TL00085"/>and philosophers left him their rich legacies; Shakespeare,<lb facs="P6_TL00086"/>Goethe, Byron, Keats, Shelley, Poe, Whitman and Wilde<lb facs="P6_TL00087"/>are his daily companions. He sees, he thinks and feels<lb facs="P6_TL00088"/>what they have left to us.

He feels as they must<lb facs="P6_TL00091"/>have felt. Kant and Hegel, Schopenhauer and Spinoza<lb facs="P6_TL00092"/>gave him their philosophy. True it is that he has been the<lb facs="P6_TL00093"/>rear-guard on a subway train for the last four years.

It is not<lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>dismal like Liverpool or Des Moines, its silence is weird<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>and oppressive. It was late, and I was looking for a place<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>to sleep. I found an old inn, and although there was no<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>sign of life, I managed after repeated knockings to gain<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>admission. The innkeeper looked at the key rack and<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>with a shrug of the shoulders, intimating to the waiter<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>that "72" was the only empty room, he threw him the key.<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>With a candle the yawning waiter led me to a room on<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>the second floor and wished me good night.<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>The room was sultry. I took off my coat and went to<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>the window. It looked straight down on a canal. On its<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>rain-blurred surface there were but vague reflections of<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>roofs and old houses. On the bank opposite was a row of<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>trees and a few benches. In the distance I saw a couple<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>of huddled forms, lovers or vagabonds, and right before<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>them on the water a few swans in motionless attitudes. It<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>was still drizzling, and I could faintly discern a medieval<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>tower almost lost in the mist.<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>The room was furnished in the ordinary frugal way, as<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>second-class hotels in France and Belgium are furnished—<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>a bed, a bureau, a night table, a chair, and an arm chair.<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>I blew out the candle, lit a cigar, and sat down near the<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>window.<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>As soon as I had entered the room I had noticed a pecu<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

I had just written a treatise "On the Volatile<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>Propensities of Odors," and had all my life been subject<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>to very acute olfactory faculties. Frequently I had cursed<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>my sensitiveness, as I was able to perceive odors that were<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>unnoticeable to others. To smell what various families in<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>a large apartment house have for dinner is no enviable<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>privilege.<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>It was a dull irritating odor. There was not a breath<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>of air in the room. I looked about, and sniffed in various<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>directions. The odor seemed to pervade the entire room.<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>I sniffed at every object, the woodwork, the linen, the<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>table cover, the wall paper, they had only their own vague<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>peculiar smell. Could it be the smell of the people who<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>had lived there before? Why should it be so intense and<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>persistent ? As it was late and the only vacant room there<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>was no use in trying to change my domicile. The best<lb facs="P15_TL00053"/>thing was to go to bed.<lb facs="P15_TL00054"/>So I undressed and tried to sleep. What strange things<lb facs="P15_TL00055"/>might have happened in this room! On every surface the<lb facs="P15_TL00056"/>actions of life are completely photographed; if someone<lb facs="P15_TL00057"/>had the necessary chemicals and could sensitize the images<lb facs="P15_TL00058"/>and call them to life, one might see on the walls, as in a<lb facs="P15_TL00059"/>moving picture show, all that had ever happened in a<lb facs="P15_TL00060"/>room. What jvould this room reveal to me, this old wall<lb facs="P15_TL00061"/>paper on which vague shadows flickered! With such<lb facs="P15_TL00062"/>haunting images in my mind, half asleep, the peculiar odor<lb facs="P15_TL00063"/>still in my nostrils, it suddenly seemed to me as if I saw<lb facs="P15_TL00064"/>two vague figures, a man and a woman, struggling in the<lb facs="P15_TL00065"/>room. The man dragged a white form to the window,<lb facs="P15_TL00066"/>she resisted, he gripped her more fiercely, they swayed for<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P15_TL00067"/>ward and backward and then I heard a splash, as if some<lb facs="P15_TL00068"/>heavy body had fallen into the water of the canal below.<lb facs="P15_TL00069"/>I jumped up; I trembled. Was it a nightmare or was it<lb facs="P15_TL00070"/>reality ? I hastened to the window. Everything was quiet.<lb facs="P15_TL00071"/>The rain had ceased. The huddled forms on the benches<lb facs="P15_TL00072"/>had disappeared.<lb facs="P15_TL00073"/>I realized that the odor had something to do with this<lb facs="P15_TL00074"/>experience. The mystery was too deep. I relit my cigar<lb facs="P15_TL00075"/>and sat down once more at the window and thus fell into<lb facs="P15_TL00076"/>a doze. This way I was found by a waiter. He looked<lb facs="P15_TL00077"/>at me with a quizzical mien. I ordered breakfast. And<lb facs="P15_TL00078"/>when he had brought it I asked him about the room. He<lb facs="P15_TL00079"/>answered that he was only a short time at the hotel, and<lb facs="P15_TL00080"/>that nobody had ever occupied it since he was there. He<lb facs="P15_TL00081"/>had noticed, however, that the innkeeper would never let<lb facs="P15_TL00082"/>anyone have the room if another was vacant. My curios<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

My mother saved a little money—<lb facs="P17_TL00075"/>enough under her management to take care of us until I<lb facs="P17_TL00076"/>could provide for her and myself. We moved into a<lb facs="P17_TL00077"/>little flat in Harlem after I had passed the grammar<lb facs="P17_TL00078"/>grades and was ready for High School.<lb facs="P17_TL00079"/>"I often thought of Alma, but had given up all hope of<lb facs="P17_TL00080"/>ever seeing her again. I was a boy past fifteen when I<lb facs="P17_TL00081"/>noticed in the school yard a little girl with two long<lb facs="P17_TL00082"/>blond braids wound like a crown around a familiar little<lb facs="P17_TL00083"/>head. She must have noticed me the same instant. It<lb facs="P17_TL00084"/>was Alma. We recognized each other and renewed our<lb facs="P17_TL00085"/>friendship on the spot. Her father was dead, she told me,<lb facs="P17_TL00086"/>and her mother had married a tailor whose shop was<lb facs="P17_TL00087"/>directly under the flat where my mother and I were<lb facs="P17_TL00088"/>living.<lb facs="P17_TL00089"/>"And now a happy time began. In the morning she<lb facs="P17_TL00090"/>would' wait for me or I would wait for her, and we<lb facs="P17_TL00091"/>would go to school together. We skated together in<lb facs="P17_TL00092"/>winter and played tennis together in summer. My mother<lb facs="P17_TL00093"/>was quite fond of her, and she came and went as if she<lb facs="P17_TL00094"/>were already a member of our little family.<lb facs="P17_TL00095"/>"Shortly before I went to college, I visited the summer<lb facs="P17_TL00096"/>home of a classmate—a rich Jew—as his tutor. I had<lb facs="P17_TL00097"/>had one of those insignificant quarrels with Alma just<lb facs="P17_TL00098"/>before I left. I was just as wrong as she and she just<lb facs="P17_TL00099"/>as right as I. But we were both too proud to take the<lb facs="P17_TL00100"/>first step toward reconciliation. I wrote dozens of letters<lb facs="P17_TL00101"/>to her which I tore up. Not one was sent. When I<lb facs="P17_TL00102"/>came home six weeks later, happy because I was going<lb facs="P17_TL00103"/>to buy her a present with the first money I ever earned,<lb facs="P17_TL00104"/>she had moved away. Her stepfather had sold his business<lb facs="P17_TL00105"/>and no one knew where they had gone.<lb facs="P17_TL00106"/>"I left college and decided to become a physician. My<lb facs="P17_TL00107"/>mother had died. In her last hour she was happy because<lb facs="P17_TL00108"/>she could leave me enough to prepare me for my pro<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00109"/>fession. One evening during the last examinations, when<lb facs="P17_TL00110"/>I had had a harder day than usual, I took a walk before<lb facs="P17_TL00111"/>retiring. I lived near the university and at the corner<lb facs="P17_TL00112"/>of my street there was an old-fashioned beer garden back<lb facs="P17_TL00113"/>of the house where Fate and German sentiment had pre<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00114"/>served some fine old trees. The tables had colored cloths<lb facs="P17_TL00115"/>and under the light of flickering lanterns, I saw that<lb facs="P17_TL00116"/>decent quiet people were sitting around the tables, talking<lb facs="P17_TL00117"/>and sipping beer.<lb facs="P17_TL00118"/>"The place had always interested me for some reason<lb facs="P17_TL00119"/>or other. I stopped and looked through the palings<lb facs="P17_TL00120"/>where the hedge was thinnest. Just one table was un<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00121"/>occupied. I thought a glass of beer would make me all<lb facs="P17_TL00122"/>the readier for sleep. Before I had seated myself, I knew<lb facs="P17_TL00123"/>why the place had attracted me.<lb facs="P17_TL00124"/>"At the table next to mine Alma was sitting. It was<lb facs="P17_TL00125"/>unmistakably Alma. She had grown to be a very pretty<lb facs="P17_TL00126"/>young woman with brown hair and rosy cheeks. She wore<lb facs="P17_TL00127"/>a little hat and a gown of some soft material. After a<lb facs="P17_TL00128"/>while she looked toward my table and dropped her eyes.</ab>

A gay old gentleman—gray mustache and<lb facs="P18_TL00067"/>swell dude—visited her all the time, and the kid looks<lb facs="P18_TL00068"/>just like him.' "<lb facs="P18_TL00069"/>Johnny's hearers sat with thunder-struck faces. Neither<lb facs="P18_TL00070"/>knew what to say. A cloud covered the moon, but neither<lb facs="P18_TL00071"/>Tom nor the other one had the courage to look up at<lb facs="P18_TL00072"/>Johnny, whose voice was steady and quiet. Finally Tom's<lb facs="P18_TL00073"/>fat hand was put out slowly with a gesture of sympathy.<lb facs="P18_TL00074"/>And he wanted to know.<lb facs="P18_TL00075"/>"It's silly," Johnny went on, his tones so even and cool<lb facs="P18_TL00076"/>that the plump hand fell with a slap on the tightly<lb facs="P18_TL00077"/>trousered knee, "for Hopkins to make such a statement."<lb facs="P18_TL00078"/>"No baby ever looked exactly like a full-grown man.

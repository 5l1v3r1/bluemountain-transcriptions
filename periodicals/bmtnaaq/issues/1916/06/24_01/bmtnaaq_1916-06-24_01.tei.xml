One of them is: Observe closely where a man<lb facs="P3_TL00027"/>lives. Not how he lives, but just the address, that's the<lb facs="P3_TL00028"/>main thing.<lb facs="P3_TL00029"/>Lord Northcliffe, proprietor of "The Times," selected<lb facs="P3_TL00030"/>for his residence, St. James' Place; in the heart of the<lb facs="P3_TL00031"/>ultra-fashionable part of the city, right among the palaces<lb facs="P3_TL00032"/>of the proudest of the Empire. Where Lord Ellesmere,<lb facs="P3_TL00033"/>in Bridgewater House locks up his valuable pictures, right<lb facs="P3_TL00034"/>next to Stafford House, seat of the Duke of Sutherland,<lb facs="P3_TL00035"/>shaded by the Marlborough House, the palace of the<lb facs="P3_TL00036"/>Prince of Wales, only a few steps from the medieval St.<lb facs="P3_TL00037"/>James Palace, once upon a time the residence of English<lb facs="P3_TL00038"/>kings; here, where one is tempted to say, he can keep an<lb facs="P3_TL00039"/>eye from his own windows upon Buckingham Palace,<lb facs="P3_TL00040"/>here lives Lord Northcliffe, the first Baron of the Isle<lb facs="P3_TL00041"/>of Thanet, who only a few years ago was a simple Mr.<lb facs="P3_TL00042"/>Alfred Charles William Harmsworth.<lb facs="P3_TL00043"/>He is a strong, massively-built man, over the middle<lb facs="P3_TL00044"/>size, with a firm, broad, clean-shaven face. His head is<lb facs="P3_TL00045"/>of the Cecil Rhodes' type.

He was about to give<lb facs="P3_TL00050"/>his valet a few orders, he was saying good-bye to his<lb facs="P3_TL00051"/>Swedish physician, Dr. Sylvan, who gives him daily a<lb facs="P3_TL00052"/>massage treatment and he ordered one of the waiting<lb facs="P3_TL00053"/>secretaries to hand him the balance sheet of the previous<lb facs="P3_TL00054"/>day, showing the exact sales of all of his papers. He stops<lb facs="P3_TL00055"/>at "The Daily Mirror." For some time its edition,<lb facs="P3_TL00056"/>amounting to about 850,000 daily, shows a decrease of<lb facs="P3_TL00057"/>35,000 copies.</ab>

To take vengeance for this remark, Harmsworth<lb facs="P4_TL00073"/>had Salisbury's nephew make him Lord Northcliffe.<lb facs="P4_TL00074"/>Northcliffe was inclined to favor free-trade.

Next morning all the papers owned by<lb facs="P4_TL00078"/>Northcliffe came out strongly for the protective tariff.<lb facs="P4_TL00079"/>The hysterical actions of the suffragettes had started to<lb facs="P4_TL00080"/>create a sensation. So Northcliffe founded a daily paper<lb facs="P4_TL00081"/>for women. It didn't sell and therefore he transformed<lb facs="P4_TL00082"/>the political paper for women into a kind of illustrated<lb facs="P4_TL00083"/>home magazine "The Daily Mirror." The part this<lb facs="P4_TL00084"/>man of the daily, almost hourly, sensation played during<lb facs="P4_TL00085"/>the South African war is well known.

There stood an old man<lb facs="P5_TL00066"/>whose long white hair was swept by every breeze, and<lb facs="P5_TL00067"/>whose tottering form He had seen silently and ceaselessly<lb facs="P5_TL00068"/>employed on that tide-swept point. The following week<lb facs="P5_TL00069"/>the astonished Captain beheld the lonely visitor digging<lb facs="P5_TL00070"/>into the mud about his house and piling up great banks<lb facs="P5_TL00071"/>behind the trenches he had thus made. Months passed<lb facs="P5_TL00072"/>by when at length the sloping walls of a rude mud fort<lb facs="P5_TL00073"/>began to take shape on the point. It was slow work and<lb facs="P5_TL00074"/>though he toiled early and late, the rising tides often swept<lb facs="P5_TL00075"/>away in a few hours the industrious labors of a week.<lb facs="P5_TL00076"/>Yet 'he persisted with a spirit that no hardship could<lb facs="P5_TL00077"/>overcome and no obstacle discourage. Indeed the pranks<lb facs="P5_TL00078"/>played upon him by the wind and tide served but to<lb facs="P5_TL00079"/>redouble his energy and perseverance.<lb facs="P5_TL00080"/>A year sped away and people gazed in wonder on the<lb facs="P5_TL00081"/>walls of a tolerable fort constructed with mud and rushes<lb facs="P5_TL00082"/>which the old man had built. At the end of three years<lb facs="P5_TL00083"/>his mud covered battlements looked out upon the river<lb facs="P5_TL00084"/>with an imposing air as if they dared the haughty invader<lb facs="P5_TL00085"/>to try their mettle. Still the old man toiled, adding here<lb facs="P5_TL00086"/>a wall, there a redout, and at last fixed in those frowning<lb facs="P5_TL00087"/>walls a number of pieces of stove-pipe so that the whole<lb facs="P5_TL00088"/>structure assumed the bristling appearance of a redoubt<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00089"/>able stronghold. The fort on Blackwell's Island had now<lb facs="P5_TL00090"/>become well-known among the river men and the Captains<lb facs="P5_TL00091"/>of the larger ships that sailed up the Sound began to fire<lb facs="P5_TL00092"/>off salutes and dip their colors as they passed the mud<lb facs="P5_TL00093"/>castle on the point. This evidently gave great pleasure<lb facs="P5_TL00094"/>to the old man for he would always shows himself on his<lb facs="P5_TL00095"/>battlements and doff his hat with the air of an Admiral<lb facs="P5_TL00096"/>to the masters of the passing vessels. At last he raised<lb facs="P5_TL00097"/>up a flag pole within his castle and then it was indeed<lb facs="P5_TL00098"/>comical to see the colors faithfully dipped whenever a<lb facs="P5_TL00099"/>ship honored him with a salute. There is a tale told to<lb facs="P5_TL00100"/>this day among the old river men of how a British Man<lb facs="P5_TL00101"/>of War mistook this mud fort for an actual harbour<lb facs="P5_TL00102"/>defense and fired off a great salute upon passing it, and<lb facs="P5_TL00103"/>how the old commander appeared and doffed his cap<lb facs="P5_TL00104"/>many times and dipped his colors gallantly to the great<lb facs="P5_TL00105"/>amusement of the river men along the shore.<lb facs="P5_TL00106"/>The old fort went to rack and ruin many years ago<lb facs="P5_TL00107"/>with its old commander and builder. Wind and tide<lb facs="P5_TL00108"/>soon laid it waste, and even its builder is forgotten; yet<lb facs="P5_TL00109"/>there might be some old cronies who are passing their<lb facs="P5_TL00110"/>last days at Sailors Snug Harbour who could tell you as<lb facs="P5_TL00111"/>they have me, of the old Fort on Blackwell's Island.</ab>

Suicide also is a great<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>sin. What shall I, unfortunate man, do? Shall I add to<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>a great sin by committing another one?

But in order to repent I need time.<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>My duty towards myself; my duty towards Heaven is<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>to live, to live, to live. To live as long as possible in<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>order to gain a long time to repent in."<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>He unfastened the rope from the tree: so that it might<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>not lead into temptation some unfortunate who thinks<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>he is through with life and who doesn't recognize the<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>truth as he did.<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>He put the rope into his pocket.<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>Even a rope might be useful to perform a good work.<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>And he walked back toward the city.<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>The way was long.<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>Long ways usually bring many thoughts.<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>Judas thought:<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>"I have to undergo a great penance.

But would it<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>lead to anything? Really it would be easy for me! It<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>would mean that I make it easy for myself. Have I a<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>right to do this? Didn't the Master say that it is easier<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>for a camel to walk through the eye of a needle than for<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven? May I<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>not put obstacles into my own way in order to make it<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>harder for myself?"<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>Judas went to the High-priest and said: "Yesterday in<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>my ire. did I throw at your feet thirty pieces of silver.<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>To-day I am quiet and I have changed my mind.

He went to Alexandria.<lb facs="P14_TL00078"/>He selected for himself as his future habitation, a small<lb facs="P14_TL00079"/>town with a good climate in Egypt: "I must try to live<lb facs="P14_TL00080"/>as long as possible for my work," he said to himself.<lb facs="P14_TL00081"/>It was a town in which were many poor people. There<lb facs="P14_TL00082"/>he settled- Judas thought again: "The Master has ordered<lb facs="P14_TL00083"/>The rich shall give to the poor all of his possessions.<lb facs="P14_TL00084"/>But I own nothing yet. Twenty pieces of silver—what<lb facs="P14_TL00085"/>is that? At first I have to obtain riches in order to be<lb facs="P14_TL00086"/>able to give them away. If I should ever get rich, then<lb facs="P14_TL00087"/>I will be able to do the right thing: not miserable pennies<lb facs="P14_TL00088"/>will I give to the poor, but uncounted wealth."<lb facs="P14_TL00089"/>Delighted with his thoughts, he continued: "What shall<lb facs="P14_TL00090"/>I start to do?"

If the poor need it they can take<lb facs="P14_TL00094"/>it. Later on if they don't need it any longer they can<lb facs="P14_TL00095"/>bring it back in order to take it again in times of need,<lb facs="P14_TL00096"/>just as if they took it from their own pockets."<lb facs="P14_TL00097"/>And he began to lend out his money on easier con<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P14_TL00098"/>ditions than the other usurers and at first he also asked<lb facs="P14_TL00099"/>less for interest. Soon all the other usurers were ruined<lb facs="P14_TL00100"/>and had to move to other cities. Then he increased the<lb facs="P14_TL00101"/>rate of interest. In order to make his dream come true<lb facs="P14_TL00102"/>so much the quicker, he said to himself: "The others are<lb facs="P14_TL00103"/>usurers, I am a benefactor. The others earn the money<lb facs="P14_TL00104"/>for themselves, I am doing it only for a good cause. I<lb facs="P14_TL00105"/>am only the keeper of your money. You, the proprietors,<lb facs="P14_TL00106"/>can come and take whenever you wish to. I am taking<lb facs="P14_TL00107"/>interest only to be able to lend out much more money."<lb facs="P14_TL00108"/>And so the poor not only enriched him, but they were<lb facs="P14_TL00109"/>also grateful.<lb facs="P14_TL00110"/>The city had many poor and therefore usurers got<lb facs="P14_TL00111"/>rich quickly.<lb facs="P14_TL00112"/>The women of the town were famous for their beauty<lb facs="P14_TL00113"/>and Judas said to himself: "If we consecrate an offering<lb facs="P14_TL00114"/>to God, we do not offer him an old ox, worn out from<lb facs="P14_TL00115"/>labor, but a calf which never wore a yoke yet. I, myself,<lb facs="P14_TL00116"/>am an ox exhausted from labor. Our father Abraham<lb facs="P14_TL00117"/>didn't wish to sacrifice himself either and a voice from<lb facs="P14_TL00118"/>the clouds didn't tell him: "Abraham, sacrifice thyself"<lb facs="P14_TL00119"/>but it ordered him "Sacrifice your son Isaac." I also<lb facs="P14_TL00120"/>shall do as our father Abraham did. Abraham's god was<lb facs="P14_TL00121"/>a god of Death. Our god is a god of Life.

Accept my Isaac,<lb facs="P14_TL00124"/>0 God!"<lb facs="P14_TL00125"/>And Judas married a beautiful girl. After she had born<lb facs="P14_TL00126"/>him her first son, Judas spoke to his consciousness: "Now<lb facs="P14_TL00127"/>1 have just one duty : to educate my son in piety and in<lb facs="P14_TL00128"/>the principles which I recognize as the right ones.

He was educating him constantly.<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>Whenever people came into the shop of Judas Junior,<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>boiling over with indignation and desperation, swearing<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>and damning, Judas, the authorized manager of his son,<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>said: "Never and towards none should we permit our<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>temper to get away with us. We should always love each<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>other." They answered: "How can I love my worst<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>enemy r<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>* Judas answered with a mild smile: "You should even<lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>love your enemy. If he sees your love, he, too, will love<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>you. Hatred is always defeated by love." On purpose, he<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>took occasion to repeat this in front of his son, so that<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>he would learn from his earliest childhood.<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>Often someone came and begged, in his helplessness:<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>"Give me money, I will pay any interest you advise; this<lb facs="P16_TL00038"/>one or that one oppresses me and I am in danger of being<lb facs="P16_TL00039"/>thrown into prison."<lb facs="P16_TL00040"/>And Judas would say: "Take from my son the double<lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>amount and pay your creditor. He will be ashamed of<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>himself." Of course they very rarely paid any attention<lb facs="P16_TL00043"/>to him.

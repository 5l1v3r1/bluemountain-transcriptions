No more heart-sickening<lb facs="P2_TL00019"/>and disappointing task is in store for us than this disheartening<lb facs="P2_TL00020"/>search for living-quarters. If we like one place, we can't afford<lb facs="P2_TL00021"/>to rent it; we stumble against one that just suits us and suits<lb facs="P2_TL00022"/>our pocket-book, we congratulate ourself on our good luck and<lb facs="P2_TL00023"/>then we learn that some other luckier being had not only rented<lb facs="P2_TL00024"/>it an hour ago, but also had left a deposit to substantiate the<lb facs="P2_TL00025"/>deal. And with the first shadows of the dying day our spirits<lb facs="P2_TL00026"/>reach that point below zero where we don't care a rap and<lb facs="P2_TL00027"/>we ring the bell of a house and tell ourself, "If there are<lb facs="P2_TL00028"/>quarters that cost so much and so much, I'll take them."<lb facs="P2_TL00029"/>And so they settle and are happy and contented, and start out<lb facs="P2_TL00030"/>with enthusiasm, and Greenwich Village once more fills its<lb facs="P2_TL00031"/>mission as it has done for the last one hundred years, since<lb facs="P2_TL00032"/>that memorable day when Tom Paine hunted for lodging in the<lb facs="P2_TL00033"/>dreamy, sunny hamlet, nearly two miles away from the<lb facs="P2_TL00034"/>New York of those days to live here the quiet life of a hermit<lb facs="P2_TL00035"/>in the company of Madame Bonville and her two sons.</ab>

All great brain-workers have been good sleepers<lb facs="P12_TL00007"/>and long sleepers, nothing serving like sleep to restore the<lb facs="P12_TL00008"/>delicate tissues of the brain, worn thin by mental effort. There<lb facs="P12_TL00009"/>have been exceptions, but they were not long livers.<lb facs="P12_TL00010"/>Mr. Edison, though as great a man as need be cited, holds<lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>a contrary view; four hours, he thinks, being enough for sleep.<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>The authorities are against Mr. Edison, as regards the really<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>first-class thinkers of the world. That the great inventor is<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>himself an exception goes merely to prove the rule.<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>The list of good sleepers among literary men is fortifying.<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>"Health is the first Muse," says Emerson; and sound sleep is the<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>first mark of the healthy man. One cannot but figure Rabelais<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>as a great lusty sleeper like his own Gargantua. A giant<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>requires a giant's sleep and one must have slept well to have<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>earned the privilege of keeping the world awake during several<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>centuries. Insomnia was unheard of in the immortal Abbey of<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>Thelema.<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>Montaigne was a luxurious sleeper, and spent more hours in<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>his bed than in his famous tower. His essays have lasted the<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>better for it.

                                    <lb facs="P13_TL00005"/>ductiveness of Voltaire were looked upon by many pious people<lb facs="P13_TL00006"/>of the Eighteenth Century as a special manifestation of the<lb facs="P13_TL00007"/>power of the Devil. This notion is not yet wholly abandoned.<lb facs="P13_TL00008"/>Morley thinks that had Voltaire died at fifty, he would have<lb facs="P13_TL00009"/>left no enduring name, his best work having been done after<lb facs="P13_TL00010"/>that age. We see now that it was sleep and moderation in<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>all things which preserved Voltaire—not the Devil. He would<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>remain in bed for weeks at a time—not ill, but resting and<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>recuperating. Mark Twain has taken a hint from the great<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>Frenchman, and shown us how<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>"To husband out life's taper at the close,<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>And keep the name from wasting by repose."<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>Goethe, who ranks as the greatest creative mind since<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>Shakespeare, and who to short-lived men seemed to rival the<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>gods in his age and beauty and power—owed much to sleep*<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>Fourteen hours was his regular tale, and it so preserved the<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>vigor of his mind that a full half-century divided the first<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>from the second "Faust." In his old age, as Heine tells us,<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>he looked like Jupiter, and surely his unusual span of life—<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>peaceful, creative, beneficient—had much that was divine about<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>it. In his passions, too, he greatly resembled the old pagan<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>gods—but I must not stray from my theme.<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>Balzac slept badly, and giant as he was, to this fact must<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>be attributed his premature break-down. He had a theory<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>that the creative faculties deteriorate under much sleep, and<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>so he worked at night, stimulating himself with the strongest<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>coffee, and ordinarily slept but a few hours in the day-time.<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>Gautier tells us how his stentorious breathing sounded through<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>the house like that of some wounded animal. Had Balzac<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>more wisely regulated his sleep and taken the rest his enormous<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>labors needed, he would perhaps have lived to finish his "Human<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>Comedy."<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>To some extent, Dickens had the same unfortunate habit of<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>burning the candle at both ends. Though he commonly did his<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>stint in the cheerful day, his brain became abnormally active<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>under the spur of creative effort and often drove him forth to<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>prowl about London the long night through. On this account, we<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>have some wonderful sketches of London in the dark hours—<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>but they scarcely make up for the fact that Dickens died under<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>sixty.</ab>

By this simple means he can produce<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>various shades of expression so that people can tell what his<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>attitude is and what he thinks of the way they are treating him<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>at the particular time. Ordinarily the cat, whether lying by<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>the fireside or basking on the door-step or just walking along,<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>has a dreamy expression in his eyes. He appears always to be<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>thinking over some trouble and to want to be let alone. He<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>doesn't know whether he will be or not. When anybody comes<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>around and he sees them looking at him, he keeps still and puts<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>on a look of meekness and deference to show that he wants to<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>stay, but if necessary he will go away.<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>This look is made just with his eyelids. He raises them<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>a little, then lowers them slowly down almost as far as they will<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>go. He makes them tremble a few times there and then lets<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>them up to approximately their regular place. No matter if<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>there is something on his conscience, he looks one straight in<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>the face and squints both eyes the same amount so that he<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>doesn't arouse any suspicion.<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>The expression of meekness is the one he can give best, because<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>he uses it most. But when he wants to look fierce, like when<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>he is mad at another cat, he can. He stands up as tall as he<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>is able and opens his eyes wide and his mouth, too.<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>There is no other way he could produce these diverse effects<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>and if he didn't know how to do it with his eyelids he wouldn't<lb facs="P15_TL00053"/>be able to produce them at all.</ab>

Keep a natural<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>face so that the few people that perhaps might have noticed us<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>think you were waiting for me, and I simply joined you coming<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>out of the hotel. Please carry my satchel."<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>In front of one of the windows of a big department store<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>she handed me her grip. She was a young woman. She had on<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>a purple evening coat and very small white satin slippers. I<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>saw her face for the fraction of a second. I could not notice<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>any details but felt instinctively that she must be beautiful.<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>She had no hat but I thought I noticed an aigrette standing<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>out of the masses of her blonde hair. "Please don't look at<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>me, as it might arouse the suspicion of those that perhaps<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>follow me," she said, taking a firm grip on my arm in such<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>i manner that I could not have turned without swinging her<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>completely around. She was not quite as tall as I am and all<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>I could see by turning my head was her white aigrette and her<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>blonde hair. If I only had a cigarette! We reached the depot<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>and 1 thought it best to keep silent. •<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>"Please promise you won't look at me," she said after we<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>reached the well lighted waiting hall, "will you promise?"<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>she asked, necessitating my answer.<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>"Of course 1 won't look at you," I said.<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>"That is very sweet of you, was her reply. We walked<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>down the steps, and I was obsessed by two thoughts. "I must<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>not look at her and how could I get a cigarette?"<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>"And now I will have to ask you to give me my satchel," I<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>heard her say, "you promised not to look at me. _It is most<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>essential that you keep your promise, no matter if you will<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>accept my proposition or not. I shall leave you now and go<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>into the women's waiting room for a few minutes. Will you<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>please manage honestly not to look at me, and still not arouse<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>the curiosity of the people around while I leave you?"<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>"I think I can manage that," I answered. I fixed my eyes<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>upon one of the maps high up on the walls of the station.<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>It was a map of Central America and I tried to find the Porto<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>Rican Island while I handed her her satchel.<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>"I am so happy I singled you out," it sounded like a sigh<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>of relief. "I'll be back instantly."<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>I waited a few minutes before I cast my eyes the direc<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>tion of the women's waiting room. I just saw her disappear in<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>one of the doors. She had an exquisite figure but there was<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>nothing especially distinctive about her. After I had lost<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>sight of that purple evening wrap, I am sure I could not have<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>differentiated her from a few other women that passed in suc<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Everybody around<lb facs="P6_TL00055"/>me seemed to have some definite goal he was anxious to reach.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>haps can help. And so she asks you for a night's lodging, or<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>for a nickel to buy a glass of beer, or to carry her satchel and<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>not look at her. If I only had a cigarette, how happy I would<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>be!<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>"Well, here I am, my knight sans peur and sans reproche."<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>I instinctively turned around and if I had not recognized her<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>voice, I surely would not have recognized my purple companion<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>of a few minutes ago. She wore a heavy green and red-brown<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>checked ulster and a white veil over a black sailor hat that<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>made it impossible to recognize her features. She was girlishly<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>slender, and putting on her gloves. She had the most wonderful<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>hands I had ever seen. They were long and slim, the nails well<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>cared for, pink and oval. The knuckles strong. "I had the things<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>in my grip. I checked the grip. Please take the check and keep<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>it for me.<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>"I think you are wonderfully composed. You seem to<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>have self-control and I appreciate what you did for me tonight<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>more than you can ever understand. Even if you don't think<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>you can accept my proposition, please do not ask any questions.<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>All that is necessary for you to know, I shall tell you."<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>I kept silent. She didn't speak for a few seconds. We<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>had walked toward the Seventh Avenue back. I felt that the<lb facs="P7_TL00043"/>one who was uncomfortable and uneasy in this strange situation<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>was not myself, but her. But I did not intend to ask any<lb facs="P7_TL00045"/>questions or encourage her in any way to tell me her story. You<lb facs="P7_TL00046"/>can't coax a bird to sing. He must feel like it and do it<lb facs="P7_TL00047"/>voluntarily with all the enthusiasm he is capable of: and then<lb facs="P7_TL00048"/>it is worth while listening.<lb facs="P7_TL00049"/>"Would you like to make twenty-five thousand dollars in one<lb facs="P7_TL00050"/>week?" she started. I felt her eyes scrutinizing my face.<lb facs="P7_TL00051"/>A true daughter of New York, I thought, bred and raised in the<lb facs="P7_TL00052"/>home town of the dollar-hunter. But at the same time, most<lb facs="P7_TL00053"/>striking proof of the existence of heredity. Some of her<lb facs="P7_TL00054"/>early ancestors must have been fighters or robbers, explorers<lb facs="P7_TL00055"/>or pirates or something of that kind. I kept silent.</ab>

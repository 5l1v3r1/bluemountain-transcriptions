But those old houses and the<lb facs="P2_TL00004"/>architecture of the first decades of the last century, and the<lb facs="P2_TL00005"/>Square, with its melancholy quietness, the zig-zag of streets<lb facs="P2_TL00006"/>all around it, "get her." She feels that old and ever new lure.<lb facs="P2_TL00007"/>She knows instinctively that there must be more in life than<lb facs="P2_TL00008"/>just figures and society and the same things over and over<lb facs="P2_TL00009"/>again. She craves for romance. She knows her O. Henry;<lb facs="P2_TL00010"/>the "Bagdad on the Subway," with its "Haroun-al-Raschid"<lb facs="P2_TL00011"/>nights is hers just for the taking. And so she walks out into<lb facs="P2_TL00012"/>life <lb facs="P2_TL00013"/>And then there is the studio, on the south side of the Square,<lb facs="P2_TL00014"/>and the man who lives in it, and his friends. He is the real<lb facs="P2_TL00015"/>Greenwich Village dweller. He will remain so, no matter where<lb facs="P2_TL00016"/>he lives. Every place under the sun means to him a Quartier<lb facs="P2_TL00017"/>Latin, or a Greenwich Village in Paris or New York. He carries<lb facs="P2_TL00018"/>everywhere his own atmosphere. He is a painter or he is a writer<lb facs="P2_TL00019"/>or he is a sculptor. Life means to him his art. Everything else is<lb facs="P2_TL00020"/>secondary. He can be compared only to the business man who is<lb facs="P2_TL00021"/>above the class of wage-earners, who is doing big things in<lb facs="P2_TL00022"/>the industrial or manufacturing field—not because of the money,<lb facs="P2_TL00023"/>but because he loves the game, because he wants to create, be<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P2_TL00024"/>cause he is master of his own life, and therefore an equal of<lb facs="P2_TL00025"/>everybody else who knows what he wants in the world, and<lb facs="P2_TL00026"/>superior to those who have not found themselves as yet. He<lb facs="P2_TL00027"/>is one of the many thousands that our village lodges. It is<lb facs="P2_TL00028"/>he who "creates atmosphere." And then, there are the other<lb facs="P2_TL00029"/>elements, the sons of rich parents, who are sowing wild oats<lb facs="P2_TL00030"/>and mistake their desire to drink life to the full for artistic<lb facs="P2_TL00031"/>inclination. There are women who desire to make the world<lb facs="P2_TL00032"/>better after realizing that they have tried in vain to better<lb facs="P2_TL00033"/>their own lives. And above all hovers that happy element of<lb facs="P2_TL00034"/>youth, of ambition, and of the desire to do something, to be<lb facs="P2_TL00035"/>somebody, to live <lb facs="P2_TL00036"/>It isn't a complicated play which tries to solve some problem.<lb facs="P2_TL00037"/>These people on the stage don't take themselves and their lives<lb facs="P2_TL00038"/>more seriously than the originals do around the corner, on the<lb facs="P2_TL00039"/>Square. They want to be happy. They want to make their<lb facs="P2_TL00040"/>lives as full as possible. They want beauty, and above all, a lot<lb facs="P2_TL00041"/>of fun.<lb facs="P2_TL00042"/>"Greenwich Village," as it will be presented to the audience<lb facs="P2_TL00043"/>of Charles Edison's Little Thimble Theatre, is a lot of fun<lb facs="P2_TL00044"/>from start to finish. There is the fun in the mansion on the<lb facs="P2_TL00045"/>north side of the Square, and the fun in the attic on the south<lb facs="P2_TL00046"/>side, and the fun in the bachelor apartment in one of those<lb facs="P2_TL00047"/>newly-rich-occupied dwellings coming up like mushrooms be<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P2_TL00048"/>tween the old mansions in the village. And what they can't<lb facs="P2_TL00049"/>express in words—and there are so many things that really<lb facs="P2_TL00050"/>can be felt only—the music will convey.<lb facs="P2_TL00051"/>Incidentally, music and play are written in Greenwich Village,<lb facs="P2_TL00052"/>but come and see and hear, yourselves.</ab>

Its a typical highbrow cigarette and I'll bet you'll<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>find mighty few chaps in the Pall Mall Club smoking Pall Mall<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>cigarettes. But it showed me clearly again the character of this<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>girl. There was first of all a hereditary delicacy that forebade<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>her to ask questions, to make a remark or to offer me her purse<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>to purchase these cigarettes. And then, her New York breeding:<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>I am sure she went to that cigar counter and said, "Give me the<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>best cigarettes you have," what the cigar clerk translated<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>into "the most expensive cigarettes in stock." He gave her a<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>package of matches, too.<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>Never had a cigarette tasted better to me than this Pall<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>Mall. It was a luxury.

My companion must have watched me, realizing that I<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>did not wish to be disturbed while I was lighting my cigarette.<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>"How about my proposition now?" she asked finally, after<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>I had taken my third puff and was really contented, contented<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>with the world in general and with myself and my present<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>situation in particular.<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>"My dear girl," I said, "you have far too beautiful hands<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>to commit murder. I don't believe that you are a thief and even<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>if you were a murderess and a thief, I would gladly accept<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>your proposition. Of course, I want to know a little more in<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>detail what you will expect me to do. But do not mention the<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>twenty-five thousand dollars again. It doesn't sound nice.

If<lb facs="P7_TL00052"/>you don't want to walk, you will have to pay your fare, and you<lb facs="P7_TL00053"/>will have to pay mine, too."<lb facs="P7_TL00054"/>"But where are we going?"<lb facs="P7_TL00055"/>"To my apartment, of course."</ab>

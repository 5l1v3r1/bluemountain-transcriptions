There are certain<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>Russian authors who had been for more than a hundred years<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>on the Russian proscription list and who in these days of a<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>closer relationishp and of increased interest with and for Russia<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>in England have been rushed into print and fed to the people<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>at large as a new source of information about Russia and its<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>real conditions. It is done to-day as of yore. There is a new<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>translation of Gogol's "Dead Souls." It is a wonderful tale,<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>the masterpiece of Gogol, a figure in Russian letters somewhat<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>similar to our own Poe, but it is in no way representative of<lb facs="P11_TL00048"/>Gogol's work.

Of<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>course, there wasn't very much to take in our studio and the<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>landlord may have calculated that he might be just as bad<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>off if he rented the studio and kitchenette to some other painter,<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>or perhaps worse. But this expedient in time, lost its effect.<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>The landlord became familiar with the thought of death.<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>Swiatecki intended to execute three paintings a la Wuertz, to<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>be called: "The Death," "The Funeral" and"The Awakening<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>from Lethargy." Of course the landlord was designated to<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>figure in all of them.<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>This sort of corpse business was the specialty of Swiatecki,<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>who after his own declaration painted "big carcasses, small<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>carcasses and middle-sized carcasses." Maybe that's the reason<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>that nobody buys his pictures, notwithstanding the fact he has<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>talent. Just now he had sent to"The Salon," in Paris, two<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>"grand cadavers" and I, too, submitted there, my "The Jews<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>of Jerusalem" which the catalogue of the Salon had<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>rebaptized into "The Jews on the Rivers of Babylon." And<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>now we were awaiting impatiently the verdict of the jury.<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>Of course, Swiatecki knew in advance that everything would<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>end most disgustingly: "The jury," he contended, "was composed<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>of the most complete idiots, and if this were not the case, I<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>was an idiot and he too, our pictures idiotic, and their winning<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>recognition would be the height of idiocy."<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>How much this fellow contributed, to my discomfort<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>during the three years I shared a studio with him, is very<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>hard to describe. It is his highest ambition to be taken for a<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>moral "grand corpse," so, for instance, he feigns to be an<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>habitual drunkard, and of course, he is far from being one.<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>He drinks hastily two or three glasses of brandy, and glances<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>around to see if we noticed it. If he isn't sure that we did,<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>he nudges one of us with his elbow and looking at us significantly<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>he asks with his sepulchral voice:<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>"I'm pretty far down, am I not?"<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>We answer him that he is foolish and then he starts to rave;<lb facs="P15_TL00053"/>because nothing puts him more out of temper than to have us<lb facs="P15_TL00054"/>doubt his moral downfall.</ab>

Finally we decided to cast lots. We did. Swiatecki lost<lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>and walked in front of me. We were at the saddle of a<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>mountain. We walked slowly and carefully. At first the path<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>was rather broad, but it became more and more narrow, and,<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>as far as we could make out, there were precipices to the<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>right and to the left, perhaps very deep ones.<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>The ridge of the mountain is very narrow, and what is still<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>worse, pieces of the withered mountain crumbled under our<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>feet .... we have to crawl on all fours, otherwise it is<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>impossible.

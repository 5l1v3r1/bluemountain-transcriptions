The President is both a<lb facs="P3_TL00040"/>dreamer, so-called, and a practical man.

It does not, however, commit his party.<lb facs="P4_TL00005"/>He voted as an individual, not as head either of the Government<lb facs="P4_TL00006"/>or of the party. For this reason the Democratic forces in the<lb facs="P4_TL00007"/>cities, opposed to woman suffrage, cannot object to his action<lb facs="P4_TL00008"/>as committing the party to the cause. The anti-prohibitionist<lb facs="P4_TL00009"/>Democrats will not like his action, of course, because they think<lb facs="P4_TL00010"/>the woman vote will be always and everywhere an anti-liquor<lb facs="P4_TL00011"/>vote, but the President himself is not a Prohibitionist like Mr.<lb facs="P4_TL00012"/>Bryan. It is doubtful if many admirers of the President will<lb facs="P4_TL00013"/>be swung over to the suffrage movement because he has taken<lb facs="P4_TL00014"/>it up. What his vote will do is that it will make people think<lb facs="P4_TL00015"/>the question over for themselves when they find that a thinker<lb facs="P4_TL00016"/>snch as he is known to be has reached the affirmative conclusion.<lb facs="P4_TL00017"/>Speaking generally, the President's vote shows more that popular<lb facs="P4_TL00018"/>opinion has moved him than that he will move it. He helps<lb facs="P4_TL00019"/>the movement, I should say, just because his vote has weight<lb facs="P4_TL00020"/>on account of his being a good judge of the popular sentiment,<lb facs="P4_TL00021"/>whereas Mr. Taft's opposition is unimportant because he is<lb facs="P4_TL00022"/>such a poor judge of the popular feeling upon anything.

While the writer<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>has it comparatively easy to persuade a publisher to see the<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>merits of his works, the musician is handicapped by that supreme<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>illusion which has taken hold of all impresarios and producers<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>of plays: that America has no music and that the American<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>has to look for real good stuff to Mother Europe. But the<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>worst of it is they don't want even to lend themselves to an<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>experiment. They are afraid of everything that hasn't got<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>the European label.<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>It would be megalomania to assume that the activities of the<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>Little Thimble Theatre, even if successful beyond expectation,<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>could change this condition.

They talk only rarely. They are the<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>quiet philosophers of our Square. They sit often for hours<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>staring up at the skies or looking down to the ground, following<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>with quick eyes the steps of passersby. The drivers in the<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>afternoon are the only distraction in their sordid life. They<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>are the event of the day for the bench-dweller.

"Harmony of color, expression of<lb facs="P11_TL00015"/>the inhabitant's individuality can be kept inside the purse limit<lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>of everybody," is the contention of Mr. Hellmann. In twenty<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>talks spread over the twenty weeks of the coming season,<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>he will show in his studio how his theories can be put into<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>practice—by everybody.

                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00006"/>piRTHDAYS in Germany are family holidays.<lb facs="P16_TL00007"/>Children look forward to the anniversary of their arrival<lb facs="P16_TL00008"/>on earth with a similiar, delightful anxiety as to Christmas<lb facs="P16_TL00009"/>eve with its joys and surprises.<lb facs="P16_TL00010"/>The German loves traditions and customs. What he saw<lb facs="P16_TL00011"/>in his father's house he most likely will practice in his own.<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>He will celebrate his father's or mother's birthday in his own<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>home perhaps hundreds of miles away or years after their<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>departure from life. Gifts received on birthdays are the key<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>to the ambitions and wishes of the recipient and to the attitude<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>of the giver towards him.<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>A few Christmas eves and a few birthdays tell the glory<lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>of Wagner's life.<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>It was several months after the death of his stepfather in<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>the modest home of his mother. Richard was nine years old<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>and was to enter a regular school for the first time in his life.<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>The four oldest brothers and sisters had entered stage life and<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>were in other German cities.<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>There were under the Christmas tree the Christmas cake<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>and apples and nuts and a new suit for Wagner. The<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>mother knew what had worried her son when he had passed<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>the examination and was admitted to the school. All the<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>other children had appeared in neat dresses with linen cuffs and<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>linen collars. He alone wore clothes his mother had made at<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>home.<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>Eighteen years later Wagner celebrated his birthday in simi<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00032"/>larly poor surroundings. It was in Paris. The hopes for a<lb facs="P16_TL00033"/>big success had long vanished and he and his young wife<lb facs="P16_TL00034"/>were living in two, cheaply-furnished rooms. Trinkets and<lb facs="P16_TL00035"/>possessions were pawned and they called nothing their own<lb facs="P16_TL00036"/>but what they wore.<lb facs="P16_TL00037"/>After nearly a year's residence in Paris the clothes Wagner<lb facs="P16_TL00038"/>had brought with him from Germany were showing sad signs<lb facs="P16_TL00039"/>of wear. The year had been fruitless from a money point of<lb facs="P16_TL00040"/>view and his wardrobe had not been replenished. His senti<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P16_TL00041"/>tiveness on this point was well known to his young wife,<lb facs="P16_TL00042"/>Minna. To give him pleasure she hunted through Paris until<lb facs="P16_TL00043"/>she found a German tailor with a small business, who, swayed<lb facs="P16_TL00044"/>by her blandishments provided her with a suit of clothes for<lb facs="P16_TL00045"/>her husband. With tears in his eyes he used to relate the story<lb facs="P16_TL00046"/>of the birthday morning on the 22d of May, 1840. There was<lb facs="P16_TL00047"/>a bunch of flowers in the water pitcher. There was a letter<lb facs="P16_TL00048"/>from his mother, arrived a few days previously, and kept for<lb facs="P16_TL00049"/>this occasion by his thoughtful wife, there was some fruit—a<lb facs="P16_TL00050"/>luxury bought for this special occasion—and his wife's present,<lb facs="P16_TL00051"/>—the new suit.<lb facs="P16_TL00052"/>Ups and downs followed in quick sequence in the life of<lb facs="P16_TL00053"/>the struggling composer; fewer and fewer became the downs<lb facs="P16_TL00054"/>and more frequent the ups. 1857 found Wagner in London.<lb facs="P16_TL00055"/>The Philharmonic Society had chosen him as the director of</ab>

Silk for shirts<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>and for underwear, several pairs of shoes, handkerchiefs<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>and finally he went to a fashionable tailor and ordered a<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>suit. He ordered his pockets and the back of his vest to be<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>made of silk; likewise the lining of his frock coat sleeves; he<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>could not endure the touch of cotton as it produced a shudder<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

He explained that silk for the back of<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>the vest and lining for the sleeves was not at all necessary.<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>Even the richest people never had silk linings; furthermore it<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>was not seen. The last observation brought Wagner to one of his<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>indignant outbursts: "Never seen I Yes, that's the tendency of<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>this country; sham, sham, in everything. That which is not<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>seen may be paltry and mean provided only that the exterior<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>be richly gilded."<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>On his birthday he decided to wear the biretta as head gear,<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>once sanctioned by antiquity but very uncommon and not<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>worn by anyone in his days.<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>The letter he wrote to his wife on the evening of this day<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>sounded very happy, telling her about all the purchases he had<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>made, and mentioning repeatedly his happiness over the things<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>he had bought<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>Again years passed.

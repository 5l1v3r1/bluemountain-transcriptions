                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00003"/>out as the abode of a friendless man and when they spoke of<lb facs="P3_TL00004"/>him the villagers whispered the dread name—Tom Paine.<lb facs="P3_TL00005"/>There he lived with Madame Bonville and her two sons, the<lb facs="P3_TL00006"/>only companions he cared to have near him save his own<lb facs="P3_TL00007"/>thoughts. In that picturesque spot he was fully content to pass<lb facs="P3_TL00008"/>his final days in solitude and marked contrast to a life of energy<lb facs="P3_TL00009"/>and excitement.<lb facs="P3_TL00010"/>It is close upon a century since that time, and the pilgrim<lb facs="P3_TL00011"/>feet that seek to follow Paine through Greenwich Village must<lb facs="P3_TL00012"/>walk Bleecker Street (the dusty lane in much changed form),<lb facs="P3_TL00013"/>must pass Grove Street, and the fourth house from the corner,<lb facs="P3_TL00014"/>on the north side, walking towards the east, is Paine's. It was<lb facs="P3_TL00015"/>humble enough in the days when he lived there. It is far<lb facs="P3_TL00016"/>humbler now in contrast to the buildings that have grown up<lb facs="P3_TL00017"/>about it. A two-story frame house, the ground floor is made<lb facs="P3_TL00018"/>into a store, as though it made an effort to keep up with the<lb facs="P3_TL00019"/>business character of the street. Two brick structures rise<lb facs="P3_TL00020"/>above it on each side and seem to have forced the roof to a<lb facs="P3_TL00021"/>frightful angle, so different is it from its new neighbors. Once<lb facs="P3_TL00022"/>Joel Barlow went to see Paine there, and the two spent almost<lb facs="P3_TL00023"/>an entire day beside a front window, talking of many things.<lb facs="P3_TL00024"/>Paine recalled troublous days of the French Revolution, when<lb facs="P3_TL00025"/>he had written his Age of Reason in the prison of the Luxem<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00026"/>bourg, and had given it to Barlow to find a publisher. The<lb facs="P3_TL00027"/>author of the Columbiad often spoke of the visit later.<lb facs="P3_TL00028"/>The dusty road where the house stood, even though it was<lb facs="P3_TL00029"/>little traveled, came to be too noisy a place for Paine, for in<lb facs="P3_TL00030"/>his illness even the chance passer-by irritated him. So he<lb facs="P3_TL00031"/>moved away to a house in a near-by field, so far from the road<lb facs="P3_TL00032"/>that he found absolute quiet. In after days Grove Street<lb facs="P3_TL00033"/>swept this home away, and another building, numbered 59, is<lb facs="P3_TL00034"/>pointed out as the place where Paine died shortly after his<lb facs="P3_TL00035"/>removal.<lb facs="P3_TL00036"/>The hatred of many people followed Tom Paine even after<lb facs="P3_TL00037"/>death, and there could be no rest for an advocate of infidel<lb facs="P3_TL00038"/>opinions in a town where dwelt descendants of stern Hugenots.<lb facs="P3_TL00039"/>His body was taken to New Rochelle, and there, refused burial<lb facs="P3_TL00040"/>in hallowed ground, was finally laid to rest outside the town,<lb facs="P3_TL00041"/>in a corner of the farm given to him by the State in recognition<lb facs="P3_TL00042"/>of his services in the cause of the colonies against the mother<lb facs="P3_TL00043"/>country. Ten years later, William Cobbett, the English Radical,<lb facs="P3_TL00044"/>an ardent admirer of Paine, visited New Rochelle, and, seeing<lb facs="P3_TL00045"/>the neglected grave by the wayside, had the bones dug up<lb facs="P3_TL00046"/>one night and spirited away to England. In another twenty<lb facs="P3_TL00047"/>years the followers of Tom Paine had grown in number, and<lb facs="P3_TL00048"/>the Paine Historical Society erected a monument over the<lb facs="P3_TL00049"/>empty grave by the roadside. But on this spot, where no rest<lb facs="P3_TL00050"/>had been permitted him in life or in death, it seems rather to<lb facs="P3_TL00051"/>mock than to bless his grave.</ab>

Slowly it moves on to the next<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>pile, as if it knew that it carries the once luscious green leaves<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>to their last resting-place. The fountains are wrapped up with<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>straw, the benches deserted save in the afternoon sun—winter<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>is coming.

Little clouds passing quickly<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>like zealous couriers send their nicest winds with a message<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>of love and of hope down to them.

The doctors found that every vital<lb facs="P15_TL00008"/>organ was worn out, and that he had died as quietly and with as<lb facs="P15_TL00009"/>little warning as a clock gives in running down. "I have taken<lb facs="P15_TL00010"/>too many crops out of the brain," he-had said, foreseeing his<lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>early death. But the tale of lost or broken sleep was doubtless<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>the chief cause.<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>Great men of action are mostly good sleepers, and some very<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>great ones have had the enviable capacity of sleeping at will,<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>under all circumstances. We read that when the executioners<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>went in for the brave Argyl, in order to fetch him away to his<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>death, they found him sleeping as peacefully as a child. It is<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>easy to believe that Raleigh slept well on the night before his<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>unmerited death. If the gallant Essex waked often, be sure that<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>it was not from fear, but only because his heart was torn by the<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>black treachery of Francis Bacon. \<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>Napoleon could sleep at will, but he began a long suicide when<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>he ordered his secretaries to waken him on the receipt of ill<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>news. But in no event would his devouring mental activity have<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>let him sleep long—the master was too conscious of his world!<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>When, however, the need of rest became imperative, he yielded<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>to it without ceremony. We read of his dismissing a# crowd of<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>petitionary German princes before they could open their mouths,<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>with the cry, "Berthier, send these people away—l must sleep<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>fifteen minutes!"<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>Fate lurks in little things! Had Napoleon given himself sleep<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>enough, or had he never risen in the night to read his des<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Has France<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>lost the mould of such heroes ? In the Comte de Segur's account<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>of the Retreat from Moscow—the most thrilling narrative of the<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>kind since Caesar's Commentaries—we read how this great<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

To me it seems<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>the noblest story in the world, and if there ever were to be an<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>excuse for war, such heroism would furnish it. In that most<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>striking act of a great drama, I like nothing better than the<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>picture of the Marshall Ney—the bravest of the brave, as he<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>was justly called—guarding the huddled, perishing end of the<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>Grande Armee from the constant attacks of the Russians;<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>sharing all the privations and miseries of the common soldier;<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>and between repulses of the enemy, wrapping himself in his<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>cloak and taking his rest calmly in the snow—a more truly<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>heroic figure than Napoleon at the head of the column. .<lb facs="P15_TL00052"/>Great and small, let us get our sleep.</ab>

Buy me a few shirtwaists, and here is<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>a list of all the other things I need. I made that list out several<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>days ago. Now don't be afraid. Go in a big department store.<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>Go at first to the transfer department and have them give you<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>a transfer slip. Then go to the trunk department and buy a<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>big, heavy trunk. Tell the manager you wish all purchases you<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>are going to make placed in this trunk and sent to your address.<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>Do this, please, in your name. Tell them it is for the maid of<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>your aunt, or something of that kind, and they will give you<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>the right kind of stuff."<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>I realized for the first time that she really did know what<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>she was about to do. It struck me as wonderful. The girl<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>brought up in luxury, had actually the grit to start a new life,<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>really a new life. She wanted to improve the world and started<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>out by improving herself. It was Hercules work, planned for<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>weeks ahead perhaps, down to the most minute detail.<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>She handed me two hundred dollars and a long list of things<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>I should purchase. Her hands seemed so strong and so sure<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>I could not explain how it happened, what induced me to say<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>it but I believed it was the best bit of inspiration I had ever had<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>in my life.<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>"Look here," I said, "I see you really mean what you say. I<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>feel you are going to do what you intend to do. I don't know<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>what vocation you like to follow, but I know one thing! there<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>is a lot of trouble and disappointment, humiliation and hard<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>work in store for you. I know you are prepared for the worst.<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>Why not do it immediately? I think I know a way where you<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>could carry out your plans. Instead of giving to the world<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>one useful member of society you could bestow upon it the<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>gift of two.<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>"Marry me! You will have all the troubles you have eve?<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>looked for in your life. You will face economic problems you<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>never dreamed of and still there will be plenty of time left<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>to be happy and to enjoy life—real life, far away from society<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>and from teas, and that sort of thing. Will you marry me?"<lb facs="P17_TL00048"/>and I could not restrain from grasping her hand.<lb facs="P17_TL00049"/>"But you don't even know how I look," she said.<lb facs="P17_TL00050"/>"I know you are beautiful," I said, "if you'll take off that<lb facs="P17_TL00051"/>veil of yours, you'll prove it."<lb facs="P17_TL00052"/>(Concluded in next issue).</ab>

Bouck White established his<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>Church of the Revolution, and where John Reed used to live<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>before he had achieved his present glory. And talking about<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>architects on the Square, the most curious collection, of books<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>is owned by one of them, by Mr. Rayne Adams. How divergent<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>the interests of men can be is often very puzzling. Mr. Adams,<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>an old book-worm, lover of rare bindings and connoisseur of<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>out-of-the-way things, is especially interested in two kinds of<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>literature which have about as much in common as night and<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>day. One of his hobbies is forestry in America, and he collects<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>everything on this subject from an annual report of the Agri<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

His other hobby is books on all subjects but<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>written by authors who are slightly demented. A ramble among<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>these books divulges the most curious-looking shapes, pages<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>which are printed upside down and others in diagonal form,<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>bindings which seem impossible, not to speak about the con<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

There was a<lb facs="P9_TL00048"/>murmur of protest voiced by the members of the colony of<lb facs="P9_TL00049"/>artists who made their homes there, and the proposition to call<lb facs="P9_TL00050"/>the alley Boticelli Lane was vetoed, and since then just plain<lb facs="P9_TL00051"/>MacDougal has proved good enough for the name of the main<lb facs="P9_TL00052"/>street in Greenwich Village.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>We talked nearly three hours. Of course she had taken<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>off her veil and she was the most beautiful thing I ever had<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>laid my eyes upon. We decided to get married immediately<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>after I had gotten some clothes for her. I didn't intend to<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>buy all the things on her list. She could do that herself later<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>on. We had just decided that the minister of the Twelfth<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>Street Church should be called upon to perform the marriage<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>ceremony, as the door-bell rang. I wondered who it could be.<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>She went hastily into the other room and I opened.<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>It was only the letter carrier. A lot of bills. I just looked<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>over the bunch. "Ha—what was that? the familiar hand<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>writing of an art dealer. I opened the envelope. It contained<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>a check, eighty dollars payable to me. It wasn't much to start<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>housekeeping on but the situation was cleared. "Here, Nora,<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>only the mail carrier," I called. Yes, she had told me her name,<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>and her father's, a very well-sounding name, a name that spelt<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>money in seven figures. "There are a few formalities I wish<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>you to do before we start our travel through life," I said,<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>"first of all, put all the money and all the jewelry you have<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>with you in this big envelope. I'll send it back to your father.<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>I got a check here which will be enough for a starter. It won't<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>be a wonderful dress I am going to bring you, but just a plain<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>black dress your aunt's maid might have worn," and I laughed.<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>I wasn't afraid she would change her mind and even if she<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>wanted to, she couldn't have left the apartment in a decollete<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>evening gown at eleven o'clock in the morning.<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>First of all I went to the minister and asked him to come<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>to my apartment at twelve-thirty. Then I got, at the City Hall,<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>a marriage license. Then I went to a department store, bought<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>a suit for twenty-eight dollars and fifty cents, a nightgown,<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>and some toilet articles thought of immediate necessity. I had<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>the things wrapped up and took them with me.

                                    <lb facs="P15_TL00004"/>graved, it could be done later. On my way home, I stopped<lb facs="P15_TL00005"/>at a delicatessen store and ordered a lot of things sent to my<lb facs="P15_TL00006"/>apartment. The suit fitted like made to order. There was just<lb facs="P15_TL00007"/>one thing that I had overlooked. I called ap the florist and<lb facs="P15_TL00008"/>had him send up the biggest bunch of violets in his store.<lb facs="P15_TL00009"/>Nora was carried away by the spirit of her undertaking.<lb facs="P15_TL00010"/>She had done her best to transform the picturesque room into<lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>an orderly-looking library, or at least, it looked like one after<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>it was strongly suggested to me. She had even put some new<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>coal in the grate and everything was ready for the minister.<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>She seemed so happy, and she called me Jim, and it seemed as if<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>we had known each other for years. The minister arrived at<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>twelve-thirty sharp. I went into the next apartment and got<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>a couple of witnesses. We were married inside of the next<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>five minutes. I gave the minister ten dollars and asked him if<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>he wouldn't perform the office of an angel of peace and delivery.<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>I told him about the jewelry and the several hundred dollars<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>in the big envelope and asked him to deliver it to my father<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>in-law, together with our sincerest regards and the invitation to<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>take tea in our apartment at five o'clock. He agreed to help<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>us to get rid of the valuables and we were left alone.<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>We set the table, took the delicatessen store delicacies out<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>of their wrappers and ate our first meal. We made a lot of<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>plans for our future life and we were as happy as a couple of<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>children that play husband and wife. She liked my coffee<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>better, she said, than any coffee she had ever drunk before in her<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>life. Father and mother-in-law arrived at five o'clock sharp.<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>The dear old people didn't know how to act in Nora's new<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>residence. But he was the real father of his daughter. He<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>was "game." She, of course, was a little harder to manage,<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>but we hoped the best as we dismissed them about seven o'clock.<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>But both agreed that I did know how to make coffee splendidly.<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>We went out for a walk. Up Fifth Avenue, around Union<lb facs="P15_TL00037"/>Square with its wretched figures on the benches. On Madison<lb facs="P15_TL00038"/>Square we sent a long bed line of homeless men to a lodging<lb facs="P15_TL00039"/>house. We looked at the window displays of the shops on<lb facs="P15_TL00040"/>Fifth Avenue and turned in on Thirty-fourth Street, passing<lb facs="P15_TL00041"/>the corner where we had "met" yesterday. We stood still for<lb facs="P15_TL00042"/>a while and viewed the hustling crowds.<lb facs="P15_TL00043"/>"What a drama!" I said to her. "Just look at all these men<lb facs="P15_TL00044"/>and all these women. They all have a goal. They all want<lb facs="P15_TL00045"/>to reach a destination. And while they are on their way, they<lb facs="P15_TL00046"/>act for us, the bystanders, a real play." Exactly like yesterday<lb facs="P15_TL00047"/>did she thrust her arm in mine and guided me through the<lb facs="P15_TL00048"/>crowd towards the quieter Sixth Avenue.<lb facs="P15_TL00049"/>"Don't we have our goal, too, and our destinations?" she<lb facs="P15_TL00050"/>asked. "Didn't we start rather well our performance?"<lb facs="P15_TL00051"/>She pressed my arm and we walked briskly home.</ab>

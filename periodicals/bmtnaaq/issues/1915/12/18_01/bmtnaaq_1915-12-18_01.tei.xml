Publishers seventy-five?<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>years ago were discriminating in their acceptance of new<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>authors and in the material they printed. They knew that their<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>readers would use even more discrimination. To read a new<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>book was then an event in a man's life. If a pleasant event,<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>he would make a mental note and when Christmas came or a<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>birthday he would purchase another copy and mark pages or<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>passages, he would express his sentiments on the fly-leaf, he<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>would wrap it up carefully and bring it, if possible, himself to its<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>new possessor. We are not living in an age of hand-knitted<lb facs="P13_TL00040"/>stockings. Our girls would laugh at the idea of sewing shirts<lb facs="P13_TL00041"/>for their men friends. Even embroidered handkerchiefs are<lb facs="P13_TL00042"/>out of fashion. But a book should not and cannot lose its<lb facs="P13_TL00043"/>soul. It is a live thing that the clerk wraps up for us or sends<lb facs="P13_TL00044"/>with a gift card to an indicated address. It was part of a<lb facs="P13_TL00045"/>man before he wrote it and it will be part of another man<lb facs="P13_TL00046"/>after he has read it.

                                    <lb facs="P17_TL00004"/>Jenny Lind lived during this period of her life at No. 42<lb facs="P17_TL00005"/>Washington Square.<lb facs="P17_TL00006"/>IN September, 1850, Castle Garden had opened its doors to<lb facs="P17_TL00007"/>the wonder of the age—to Jenny Lind, the queen of th&lt;?<lb facs="P17_TL00008"/>realm of song. And shortly after this engagement with Barnum<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>had ended, she came to Tripler Hall, the beautiful concefrt<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>hall on Broadway, destroyed by fire a short time after its<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>trection.<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>A small chorus was selected from the societies to accompany<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>the "Inflammatus" from Rossini's Stabat Mater. At the morning<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>rehearsal for this first concert, orchestra and chorus were on<lb facs="P17_TL00015"/>the stage, when a very plain little woman, in a long dark<lb facs="P17_TL00016"/>cloak and the least adorned of bonnets, walked quickly up<lb facs="P17_TL00017"/>the aisle, ascended to the? stage and there took her place.<lb facs="P17_TL00018"/>At the proper moment she raised her head, opened her lips,<lb facs="P17_TL00019"/>and straightway rang out the high G, clear, direct, unerring<lb facs="P17_TL00020"/>in attack, sonorous and sustained:<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>Up soared the? glorious voice through the scale of trills,<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>higher and higher, until the empyrean was reached, the C in<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>alt, where the pure tone poised, jubilant and unwavering, then,<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>in a majestic descent of the? full chord, back to the dominant,<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>thence slowly swelling and sinking to rest on the tonic—<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>the whole phrase superbly effective, perfect, and satisfying.<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>Jenny Lind had sung! and to those who heard her in that<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>"Inflammatus," her voice had made a shrine once and foreve?r in<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>heart and memory.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00006"/>There was a quick elastic step. The door opened briskly and<lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>Courtland entered. His face was changed. The two deep lines<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>about his mouth which appeared when he had solved a puzzling<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>problem and was determined to face the consequences with all<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>his energy, made him look years younger. Kenneth jumped<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>to his feet. He looked into the eyes of his friend. He did not<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>know what to think. He must have looked sad and curious.<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>"You are taking it harder than I am, Kenneth. Cheer up, old<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>friend. These are only incidents in human life. We rap on the<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>door of Heaven and demand admission. And the hand of some<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>Goddess kindly opens the door a few inches wide and lets us<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>look and perhaps lifts the veil and we shall see what we have<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>never darer to hope—to imagine—and we stretch out our hands<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>and try to grasp it and the door is closed just before our faces.<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>There we stand in the cold, in the darkness, like a tramp on<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>Christmas Eve who looked into the home of a happy family<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>and the shades are drawn and the light extinguished as he<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>looks. What does he do? He stays as though dazed for a few<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>minutes and his eyes become accustomed to the darkness again<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>and he turns and starts out for his next destination. What is<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>his next destination? He doesn't know. But there will be<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>some light again, some Fata Morgana, far, far away, and it will<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>be his aim to reach his new goal.<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>"It doesn't matter whether he is disappointed again. He will<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>have something to which to look forward and the old energy,<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>so frequently lost and found again, will be his companion.

It is constantly spreading and the surest<lb facs="P13_TL00009"/>signs that something big, something unexpected will be its<lb facs="P13_TL00010"/>result in the near future are the peculiar facts that we are<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>not confronted by a distinct school of poetry which has a<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>leader and many followers, but that men, individuals here<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>and there, in the most unexpected corners of the world<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>come to the surface—l might say spring up over night.<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>They are not scholars and they are not philosophers.

Never since the memorable Nineties of the last<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>century has America had so many individualistic magazines<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>as today.

They start<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>little sheets of their own—just leaflets, and send them out<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>into the world.<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>Alfred Kreymborg and his Mushrooms were looked upon<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>as a curiosity a year ago.

He paused in his<lb facs="P16_TL00055"/>vigorous strokes of the razor over his face.<lb facs="P16_TL00056"/>"I'm going to take care of you," he said looking back over<lb facs="P16_TL00057"/>his shoulder.

A<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>whistling wind was raving in the dry branches of some trees.<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>Thunder bellowed and rolled away. It sounded like the cry of<lb facs="P17_TL00044"/>a solitary lion in an African desert, heard by a thirsty man who<lb facs="P17_TL00045"/>had lost his way. The quick lightning flashed through the thick<lb facs="P17_TL00046"/>darkness in front of the windows and illuminated the sad scenery<lb facs="P17_TL00047"/>of Autumn's dying nature. As though in a dream, lost in his<lb facs="P17_TL00048"/>thoughts, Courtland stood facing his friend but not conscious<lb facs="P17_TL00049"/>of his presence. He looked at those bookshelves filled with<lb facs="P17_TL00050"/>old, time-worn volumes, at the picturesque arrangement of troph<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

His eye rested on a picture<lb facs="P18_TL00004"/>evidently new; it was a woman with a girl's face, with big<lb facs="P18_TL00005"/>eyes and a peculiar smile about her mouth. He looked at her<lb facs="P18_TL00006"/>a long time. He had never seen this picture before; it must<lb facs="P18_TL00007"/>have been a new one, newly placed among the pictures of his<lb facs="P18_TL00008"/>friend's ancestors and relatives. He hadn't seen this face for<lb facs="P18_TL00009"/>ten years. But there was no emotion in him. He looked and<lb facs="P18_TL00010"/>the features of the woman's face seemed to become misty; they<lb facs="P18_TL00011"/>seefrned to transform and he saw a face which he had<lb facs="P18_TL00012"/>seen day and night during the last six days. There was that<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>peculiar twinkle in her eyes. He looked again but the<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>vision was gone and there was only the sister of his friend.<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>He sank very heavily into the deep chair near the window.<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>Water was streaming down the French plate-glass and<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>a few drops glowed opalescent in the light of the lamp on the<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>table. For a long time he sat without moving out of his posi<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>tion. Suddenly he awoke as though from a long deep sleep.<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>He gazed about in the room. His friend was seated at the table.<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>He seeme'd to be in deep thought. He crossed to the table and<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>took the seat opposite him. He gazed a while at his friend.<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>"You must forgive me, Kenneth. I invited you to spend a<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>quiet evening with me and be happy. I wanted to be happy and I<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>wanted you to be happy. I wanted to tell you the tale of the new<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>happiness which I meant was in store for me. I don't know<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>what you may think of my conduct tonight but, for God's sake,<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>don't think that I have lost mjr mind. I'm quiet now, perfectly<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>at ease. Only it was so hard to realize that there is no truth<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>in the face of a charming woman and that beautiful dreams<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>must be shattered and that there is no happiness in the world—<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>at least for me."<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>"Don't you think you'd better not talk about these things?"<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>interrupted Kenneth in a low tone. "You must have gone<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>through some terrible experience during the short time since we<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>left your office. I'm so sorry, Courtland. I wish I could help<lb facs="P18_TL00037"/>you. I wish I could share those horrible thoughts that you have<lb facs="P18_TL00038"/>had in the last few hours. I wish I could relieve your mind<lb facs="P18_TL00039"/>and tell you that you are mistaken."</ab>

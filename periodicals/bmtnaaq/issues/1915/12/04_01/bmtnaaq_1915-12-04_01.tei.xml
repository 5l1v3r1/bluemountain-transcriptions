Especially is this true of the<lb facs="P3_TL00004"/>half-forgotten nooks in old city by-ways where the men and<lb facs="P3_TL00005"/>women of a former generation sleepâ€”those about whose livet<lb facs="P3_TL00006"/>hang the romance of the days before I was born.

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00004"/>IN Washington Square? Park at Children's Hour are found four<lb facs="P6_TL00005"/>distinct classes of children. Not that they keep apart<lb facs="P6_TL00006"/>all the time, bless you no. The democracy of the place blends<lb facs="P6_TL00007"/>them into groups which know ve"ry little of class.

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>attended little ones of the old aristocracy of New York. These<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>children come of families who refuse to move away from the<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>Square where their fathers were born, and their fathers before<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>them, and so on back to early Dutch days. These little ones<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>are sturdy, good-looking children who spend a large? part of<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>every day out-doors.<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>Then come the children of the painters, sculptors, and writers<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>iwho have made of Greenwich Village around Square ah<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>American Latin Quartier. Of course, in books artists are sup<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>posed to have no children. In the few cases where books admit<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>such accidents have happened the great artist deserts them, or<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>at the very least neglects them. But the youngsters of<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>New York's Latin Quartier look anything but neglected. What<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>marks them off from all the rest is the unconventionality which<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>they have learned from their parents in the way of playthings,<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>manners, clothesâ€”and spontaneity. The children of artistsâ€”one<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>famous sculptor in MacDougal Alley, has sevenâ€”have a belief<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>in themselves and a daring in starting new games and new<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>friendships which is a little beyond even the usual freedom of<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>children. Perhaps it is they who make use of the park more<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>hours a day than any of the children except those very poorest<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>ones who cannot stay at home on account of heat in summer<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>and cold in winter, and disease-breeding conditions all the time.<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>Sometimes the? Quartier children are with a governess, but this<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>is most unusual. Oftener they are with their mother or older<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>brothers or sisters, if indeed their independence is not assured<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>so that they need no attendant. One writer father comes him<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The artist's children are more<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>picturesque as to clothes than any of their Their<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>garments do not conform to style at all, but are quaint with<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>individuality and in the vivid colors which children like to wear<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>and grown-ups adore to look at.<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>Then come the American-born children of Italian parents.<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>These are very numerous.

And the faith<lb facs="P7_TL00005"/>. the faith in ''the land of the free and the home of the<lb facs="P7_TL00006"/>bravfi." They are in the promised land of all good, and all<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>ddight, ready to learn what the land will teach them, and sureâ€”â€¢<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>so sure that it will be good for them. They are smaller for their<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>age than their cousins who were born here, and they are<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>thinner, too, and child-gaunt with poor food. Also they are<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>ragged and dirtier and more' odorous of garlic. But they score<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>hereâ€”they know more music than any youngster of their own<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>age, born in America. In Italy it is against the law for any<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>instrument not in tune to be played on the public streets. The<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>Italians do not wish the e'ars of their children corrupted, nor<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>the ears of the elders disgusted with inharmony. So they make<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>laws to protect their music-sense. Italy loves music, children<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>are used to it from the time they sense anything at all. The<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>appreciation of the little Italian kids for the Diamond Disc<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>records is the most enthusiastic and critical in the Park. When<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>the music begins and fascinated children of all clarses cluster<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>in evet-growing groups to listen before the dancing begins, the<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>little American aristocrats, the Quartier children, and Italian-<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>American alike, call in excited whispers: "Guiseppe, tell me<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>what is _ this piece?"

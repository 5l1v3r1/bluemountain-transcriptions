                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00004"/>117 HEN I speakof Greenwich Village I have no geographical<lb facs="P6_TL00005"/>conception in view. The term Greenwich Village is to<lb facs="P6_TL00006"/>me a spiritual zone of mind. Is there any raison d'etre for<lb facs="P6_TL00007"/>the existence of a spiritual Greenwich Village? I believe<lb facs="P6_TL00008"/>there is. Those fellow wanderers who pawn their last coat<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>in rue Franc Bourgeoise, who shivered in rue St. Jacques and<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>searched for the cheapest brasserie in rue Lepic, those who<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>crowded the Olympe in rue de la Gaiete, will understand the<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>charm of the Village. A ramble along Charlton and Varick<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>Streets is a reverie, not to speak of the sounds of—how do<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>Minetta Lane, Patchin Place, Sheridan Square and Gay Street<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>strike you?<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>To be sure the native of the Village has no especial<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>distinction. He is just as dull as the native of Bronx, or the<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>native of Hoboken. The apaches of the Village are more<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>crude than the gangs of upper Riverside. So are in propor<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The Village has also its<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>sneaking reformers and neighborhood centers full of apostles<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>in male and female petticoats, good people who clean out<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>certain parts of their territory from outcasts and drive those<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>poor dregs of humanity into other parts of the city. The joints<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>of the Village compare favorably with Doctor's and Barney<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>Flynn's emporiums on the Bowery and Chatham Square.<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>The soothsayers of yesteryear assured us that the Village<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>is doomed. . . No danger so far though the subterranean<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>barbarians are busy in reconstructing Seventh Avenue and<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>a subway for the men in a hurry. True also, the<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>"Grapevine" has disappeared and we miss the pewters of<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>creamy ale. But take courage, ye tipplers, there are other<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>heavenly retreats Jn the Village. "Grifou" is dead, but there<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>is a new brasserie de Lilla, yea, even a cafe GroessenWahn.<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>Josiah Flint, if he should awaken from his grave would not<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>be lonesome in the Village.<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>If you lose your illusions and the evil one takes hold of<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>your soul, you leave your garret on the sacred Butte and rent<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>a studio pear Pare Monceau, you leave the Soho and take<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>your domicile in Chelsea, or you become a traitor to Green<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

For the bleeding heart of the<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>poet is the bleeding heart of Christ.<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>He wears a celluloid collar and- uses paper napkins for<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>handkerchiefs. He has a pair of sox worn and washed till to<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>recall them is a pang.

They were well worn though before he got<lb facs="P7_TL00044"/>them.

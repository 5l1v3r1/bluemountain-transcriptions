And so I hurried<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>to my apartment, searched for something smokeable on tables,<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>in drawers, in the pockets of all my suits. With no result.<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>Now there is nothing worse in this world than to want to smoke,<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>knowing you can't have it. It made me restless. I am not a<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>cigarette fiend: I often pass days and weeks without smoking.<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>But the thought not to have ten cents to purchase the cheapest<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>pack of cigarettes brought me face to face with facts—well<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>I never had dared to face them. What kind of an existence is it<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>that I was leading all these years? How could it happen that I<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>was practically penniless ?

A check would come in, I would<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>pay off my house account in the club: if there was any back rent,<lb facs="P6_TL00048"/>I would pay it, too. Strengthening so my credit, I looked<lb facs="P6_TL00049"/>forward to the meager weeks to come with the same confidence<lb facs="P6_TL00050"/>as the man who deposits in the bank a substantial sum of<lb facs="P6_TL00051"/>money for rainy days.<lb facs="P6_TL00052"/>No, it was not the desire to reform, or to turn a new<lb facs="P6_TL00053"/>leaf.

"Multitude: solitude!" and<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>I tortured my mind to think of the man who had expressed<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>this supreme truth in such a wonderful way.

A studious looking fellow with clean cut<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>features linked arms with a fresh-looking girl: the eyes of<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>both are shining, intensely interested in their conversation.<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>They hurried to the tunnels. A prosperous manufacturer—<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>he must be a manufacturer—with a young woman. He is old<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>and she is young. He is proud of her and she is like one of<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>those fashion designs of Bakst: pretty, a wonderful color<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>scheme, but with dead eves: a striking impersonation of "I<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

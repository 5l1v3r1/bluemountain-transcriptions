"Warm yourself with the<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>days that were." He pulls his shabby coat-collar up about him<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>and relapses into memory. He remembers and dreams of other<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>poets who have been even as he is now. He thinks of Villon<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>skulking in the dark ways of medieval Paris, homeless and<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>without a crust. And yet Villon, prince of poets that he was<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>would seldom starve with the grace that his brethren of the<lb facs="P6_TL00044"/>craft have always worn in adversity. His dagger was out ta<lb facs="P6_TL00045"/>hit too swiftly if any good plunder offered. How did he end<lb facs="P6_TL00046"/>at last? Was it the gibbet?—this prince of poets—who knows?<lb facs="P6_TL00047"/>At the age of 32 he disappears into the night of time, as com<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00003"/>poor tramp in far-off Australia, nameless poet, he who sat with<lb facs="P7_TL00004"/>his back against a tree and sang his last song; the song of the<lb facs="P7_TL00005"/>open road, in the weird hours of the night, and was found<lb facs="P7_TL00006"/>dead the next morning. Truly he had sung his soul out and<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>was still. The poet dreams on:<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>"He walks in Broadway, to and fro<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>With the saturnine ghost of Edgar Poe"<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>as Vance Thompson once said. And so he comes down to<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>every-day associates, friends, brother-poets. Slack! nearly all<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>of them as poor as he. What a trade it is! Pah! to dream,<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>and to write golden verses!

But oh! the game!<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>What "the law's delay, the insolence of office" to"the post's<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>delay, the insolence of editors." Yes, that was always easy<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>enough. He was sharing this boon to-night with the sparrows<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>and the squirrels. For spring had not come yet, and "times were<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>hard" in the animal world as in his own. What could he not<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>eat if he only had the price! A plate of beans would be a<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>banquet.<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>And yet he knew it was futile. All day since noon he had<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>tried to raise the price of a meal, but the very stars had fought<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>against him in the courses—one disappointment after another.<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>So into the last he has come. No, not last—he shuddered—there<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>was one remoir more, only one—six feet of earth, the common<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>dowry since Adam.</ab>

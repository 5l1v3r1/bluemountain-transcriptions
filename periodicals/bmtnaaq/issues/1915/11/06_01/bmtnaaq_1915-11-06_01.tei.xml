Since 1823 the banks have<lb facs="P3_TL00046"/>not had to fly to Greenwich, and the only trace of their former<lb facs="P3_TL00047"/>nomadic visits there is Bank Street.<lb facs="P3_TL00048"/>It had been before that and was for a considerable time<lb facs="P3_TL00049"/>afterward the seat of the State prison and the landing place of<lb facs="P3_TL00050"/>the Ferry from New Jersey.

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00006"/>THE first settlers of New England made the laws of Moses<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>the groundwork of their constitutions; and often produced<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>them as the highest authority in determining suits in their<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>courts. This respect for the Levitical code will account for<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>many of their ancient laws, which appear repugnant to the<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>natural rights of men, and the feelings of the human heart.<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>The following was the statute of New Jersey restraining<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>drunkenness.<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>"Concerning that beastly vice, drunkenness, it is hereby<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>enacted, that if any person be found to be drunk, he shall pay<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>one shilling fine for the first offence, two shillings for the<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>second and for the third time, and for every time after, two<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>shillings and sixpence; and such as have nothing to pay, shall<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>suffer corporal punishment, and for those that are unruly and<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>disturbers of the peace, they shall be putin the stocks until<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>after they are sober, or during the pleasure of the officer in<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>chief in the place where he is drunk.<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>Quere. Would not the enforcing of such a statute in modern<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>times be a ready mode of raising a revenue and discharging<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>our public debts?<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>Another law of New Jersey was in these words:<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>"If any man shall absent himself, or run out of this Province<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>with another man's wife (without her husband's consent), and<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>after return hither, he and she so offending and being lawfully<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>convicted thereof, shall each of them receive ten lashes upon<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>their bare backs."<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>By another statute of that colony, every female was forbid<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>to marry her grandfather, and every male his grandmother,<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>from the five and twentieth day of March, one thousand six<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>hundred, and eighty and three.<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>Many of the laws of that colony appear to be dictated by a<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>spirit of piety; yet we find the proprietors not friendly to<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>clergymen. Among other instructions from the committee of<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>the proprietors to Governor Basse, dated, London, April 14,<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>1698, there is the following:<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>7. "That you do not consent to a law for imposing or<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>ascertaining the yearly, quarterly or any other salary, tax or<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>allowance for the maintenance of any sort of preachers or<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>ministers of whatsoever persuasion they be of in matters of<lb facs="P8_TL00045"/>religion."</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00004"/>| DIDN'T believe my eyes last Friday, but truly and honestly<lb facs="P9_TL00005"/>it was horse car—one of those old rickety New York<lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>horse cars, with chimney sticking out, puffing away white clouds<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>like a peanut roasting machine or the stove of the chestnut seller<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>on the corner of Thompson street. The horses had bells, the<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>driver a whip and a derby hat with his number stuck 011 the<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>front. Slowly but merrily it moved up Fourth street and passed<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>the Square. I was standing there at the window of my garret,<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>the same window where Lafayette during his last visit to<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>New York in 1824, witnessed the execution of a score of<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>highwaymen on what was then Potters' Field, at the same<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>window from which a lady an hour ago had called to her foot<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>man to bring her machine around to the entrance. I saw<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>the horse car passing and nobody seemed to pay any attention<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>to it, and soon the electric street car passed over the same<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>rails, and automobiles hoot-hooted, and the big electric arc<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>light in front of the windows flashed up while the city with<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>its gigantic structures back of the arch grew darker and darker.<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>It was night. Naked branches of dark trees right in front of<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>the windows. Here and there a gas lamp, yellow and flickering<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>through the darkness of bushes and benches and people of the<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>Square. Farther and farther seemed the world with its noise<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>and with the modern devices of our days' life. I lighted a candle<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>and sat in front of the grate. Winds rattled on my windows<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>and swept through the chimney, the broken and dilapidated<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>chimney. The wood-work creaked, the wind pressed its way<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>through the cracks and knot-holes. The tin on the roof rumbled<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>and the light of the candle was dancing in merriment, swaying<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>rhythmically like a young girl with her hands at her hips,<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>listening to grandmother's sweet melodies.<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>I was sitting in my old chair and thinking of the charms<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>you all are deprived of—you who are living in steam-heated,<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>electric-lighted elevator apartments — you who are living in<lb facs="P9_TL00037"/>houses with killed souls. Your telephone wires pierce their<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>hearts, your steam pipes put them on the bed of Procrustes<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>and your tapestry muzzles them.<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>And on black nights you can hear the wind moaning outside<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>in vain asking admission. He can't deliver his messages from<lb facs="P9_TL00042"/>neighboring souls. It is on those nights that you turn restlessly<lb facs="P9_TL00043"/>in your bed, listening to strange noises, that you switch on<lb facs="P9_TL00044"/>your light and reopen the book you laid away in the evening<lb facs="P9_TL00045"/>. . . . and you don't know that the house had a soul and<lb facs="P9_TL00046"/>that souls come back.<lb facs="P9_TL00047"/>But that horse car travels at least once a week through<lb facs="P9_TL00048"/>Greenwich Village : to keep up the company's franchise.</ab>

Because the<lb facs="P14_TL00005"/>quietness which surrounds us now roars almost in our ears.<lb facs="P14_TL00006"/>I almost hear how the blood circulates in my veins and I<lb facs="P14_TL00007"/>distinctly hear the palpitating of my heart. At first I found<lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>the entire situation interesting. In the pitch dark night, next<lb facs="P14_TL00009"/>to a deep abyss, on the ridge of a mountain—it was quite<lb facs="P14_TL00010"/>romantic. But soon it grows cold, and Swiatecki starts to<lb facs="P14_TL00011"/>philosophize: "What's life anyhow? Just bunk— They say:<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>Art! Art! .... just a cheap imitation of nature, and<lb facs="P14_TL00013"/>above all meanness .... haven't I seen twice the Salon ?<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>There they sent so many pictures that one could have manu<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

                                    <lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>habitants of the world. And what was that all? Made to order!<lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>A speculation to fill pocket and stomach. An anarchy of art!<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>Nothing more! If art, real art had been there, everyone would<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>have been stricken with paralysis. But to their good fortune,<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>real art isn't at all in this world. . . . there is only nature.<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>Possibly, that nature is nothing, too, but humbug . . . the<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>best would be to jump down and all would be over. I would<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>surely do it if I had some brandy, but as I have none, I have<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>to refrain myself; because I swore that I won't end sober."<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>I was more or less accustomed to Swiatecki's babble, but<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>here in the midst of the quietness the destitution, the cold, the<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>darkness and on the edge of an abyss, his words made even<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>me gloomy. Fortunately, his raving was at an end. He threw<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>a few more stones, repeated a few times: "Not a sound." And<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>we both were silent for hours.<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>And then it began to dawn. It was still dark and I could<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>see nothing. I heard the rushing of birds' wings above my<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>head. I distinctly heard crowing. I was sure it must be<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>eagles flying above the abysses; the crowing became more<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>intense in the darkness. It sounded as if legions of eagles had<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>assembled above our heads. Anyhow it meant the approach of<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>the morn.<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>Soon I could distinguish my own hands resting on the edge of<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>the mountain and soon the shoulders of Swiatecki, like black<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>silhouettes against a less black background. This background<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>turned visibly pale, a wonderful pale gray tone started to shimmer<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>through the mountains which penetrates more and more the<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>darkness as if a silver fluid had been spilled over all saturating<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>everything, fading from black to gray and from gray into a<lb facs="P14_TL00045"/>pearl color. A wet acerbity was over all. Not only the mountains<lb facs="P14_TL00046"/>were wet but also the air.<lb facs="P14_TL00047"/>It grew clearer and clearer. I am absorbed in this wonderful<lb facs="P14_TL00048"/>color scheme of nature. I am trying to retain the colors in<lb facs="P14_TL00049"/>my mind. A loud exclamation of Swiatecki interrupted me:<lb facs="P14_TL00050"/>"What asses we were!" His back vanishes from my eyes,<lb facs="P14_TL00051"/>"Swiatecki," I exclaimed, "What are you doing?"<lb facs="P14_TL00052"/>"Don't scream, just look!"<lb facs="P14_TL00053"/>I lean over, and what do I see?

But in the winter he is the principal bird.<lb facs="P16_TL00012"/>It is fortunate for him that he does not know what the<lb facs="P16_TL00013"/>people think of him. He feels that he is just as good a bird<lb facs="P16_TL00014"/>as there is in the world, and when all the other birds have<lb facs="P16_TL00015"/>gone south to where it is warm, the sparrow gets up in a big<lb facs="P16_TL00016"/>tree that has lost all its leaves and stands there in the wind and<lb facs="P16_TL00017"/>sings. He sings with all his might. He sees that the people<lb facs="P16_TL00018"/>need song, and he stays so there will be someone to give it to<lb facs="P16_TL00019"/>them. The passers-by and the people in the houses near the tree<lb facs="P16_TL00020"/>may think the sound is shrill and only a noise, but this doesn't<lb facs="P16_TL00021"/>interfere with the sparrow—he knows it is a song. And when<lb facs="P16_TL00022"/>he sings it, he is happy.<lb facs="P16_TL00023"/>He does not sing his song just to hear himself, else he would<lb facs="P16_TL00024"/>sit in his nest at home and do it. And he doesn't sing it with<lb facs="P16_TL00025"/>the idea that he will get something to eat. It is just pastime<lb facs="P16_TL00026"/>for him and he does it because he likes to and assumes that it<lb facs="P16_TL00027"/>is appreciated. This attitude is so good that, regardless of the<lb facs="P16_TL00028"/>quality of the song, the sparrow himself should be respected<lb facs="P16_TL00029"/>and made more of.</ab>

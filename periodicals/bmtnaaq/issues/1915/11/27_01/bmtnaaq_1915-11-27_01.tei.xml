                                    <lb facs="P2_TL00008"/>IN the year 1813, this noble mansion of Aaron Burr remained<lb facs="P2_TL00009"/>in good preservation, with its broad entrance, under a<lb facs="P2_TL00010"/>porch of imposing height, supported by tall columns, with<lb facs="P2_TL00011"/>balconies fronting the rooms of the second story, and with an<lb facs="P2_TL00012"/>aspect of distinction altogether beyond that of the ordinary<lb facs="P2_TL00013"/>private dwellings of that day. The outer entrance of the<lb facs="P2_TL00014"/>premises, at that period, was through a spacious gateway, placed<lb facs="P2_TL00015"/>between highly ornamented columns, at the then termination<lb facs="P2_TL00016"/>of MacDougal Street, about two hundred feet north of Spring<lb facs="P2_TL00017"/>Street. The grounds at that time had been reduced in size, by,<lb facs="P2_TL00018"/>the interposing barriers of newly opened streets, and no longer<lb facs="P2_TL00019"/>extended to the river. The beautiful piece of water, long known<lb facs="P2_TL00020"/>as "Burr's Pond," remained intact, with a full supply of the<lb facs="P2_TL00021"/>needed element, which, in winter, gave excitement and enjoyment</ab>

A<lb facs="P3_TL00013"/>turtle feast became, also, a standard entertainment, and was<lb facs="P3_TL00014"/>frequently presented to an appreciative public by a society gifted<lb facs="P3_TL00015"/>with a knowledge of such culinary accomplishments.<lb facs="P3_TL00016"/>Having passed through all the mutations of city suburban<lb facs="P3_TL00017"/>property, these premises followed the fortunes of other local<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

On its new<lb facs="P3_TL00037"/>foundation the house was placed with its front, still wearing the<lb facs="P3_TL00038"/>adornments of columns and balconies, some twenty feet with<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00005"/>JHE heading of this record finds too ample? justification this<lb facs="P5_TL00006"/>month, although of the three leading figures who have<lb facs="P5_TL00007"/>disappeared from among us: Henri Fabre, Remy de Gourmont,<lb facs="P5_TL00008"/>and Camille de Sainte Croix, only the two last properly belonged<lb facs="P5_TL00009"/>to Paris. Paradoxical as it sounds of so retiring a personality,<lb facs="P5_TL00010"/>Remy de Gourmant was efminently Parisian not only in spite<lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>but also on account of the fact that he did not parade in<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>the academical cocked hat which so much better becomes the<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>more popularly and internationally renowned Paul Bourget,<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>Maurice Donnay, Edmond Rostand, and Piefrre Loti; that his<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>boulevard was the one which is not one, i.e. the Boulevard<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>Saint Germain; and that the cafe he patronized was pure of<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>confraternal or cosmopolitan associations. To the independants<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>of Montparnasse, to the official of the' right bank, the Paris<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>of Gourmontâ€”the rue des Saint Peres, where he lived (in<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>complete solitude), the Cafe de Flore, on the frontier lintf<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>between the faubourg (Saint Germain) and the quartier (Latin),<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>where he took his occasional aperitif, are the provinces. To these<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>and to those they are out of the world and out of date. They<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>are, also, unprofessional. Remy de Gourmont kept on this<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>border-line of semi-aristocracy, semi-Bohemia in his life and in<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>his work.

He was no one's disciple and leaves<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>no disciples. His earlier tendencies inclined, no doubt, in the<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>direction of symbolism, with whose proselytes he identified<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>himself, a natural fluctuation on the part of a fastidious intellect<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>submitted to the reaction following upon naturism (Remy de<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>Gourmont was born in 1858)â€”one to which youth in its disdain<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>for the positive and concrete frequently tends at all timesâ€”and<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>whose infinite? capacity for culture compensated for what his<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>imagination might lack in power of endurance.<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>This peculiarity had occasion to find expression with the out<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

"The Spirit Lamp" is exceedingly scarce and there is<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>no complete set extant in America.<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>When Narcissus died the Trees and the Flowers desired to<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>weep for him.<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>And the Flowers said to the Trees, "Let us go to the River<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>and pray it to lend us of its waters, that we may make tears<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>and weep and have our fill of sorrow."<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>So the Trees and the Flowers went to the River, and the<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>Trees called to the River and said, "We pray thee to lend us<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>of thy waters that we may make tears and weep and have our<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>fill of sorrow."<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>And the River answered, "Surely ye may have of my waters<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>as ye desire. But wherefore would ye turn my waters, which<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>are waters of laughter, into waters that are waters of pain?<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>And why do ye seek after sorrow?"<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>And the Flowers answered, "We seek after sorrow because<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>Narcissus is dead."<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>And when the? River heard that Narcissus was dead, it<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>changed from a river of water into a river of tears.<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>And it cried out to the Trees and the Flowers and said.<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>"Though every drop of my waters is a tear, and I have changed<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>from a river of water into a river of tears, and my waters<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>that were waters of laughter are now waters of pain, yet can<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>I not lend ye a tear, so loved I Narcissus."<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>And the Trees and the Flowers were silent, and after a<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>time, the Trees answered and said, "We do not marvel that<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>thou should'st mourn for Narcissus in this manner, so beautiful<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>was he."<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>And the River said, "But was Narcissus beautiful?"<lb facs="P9_TL00037"/>And the Trees and the Flowers answered, "Who should<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>know that better than thou? Us did he ever pass by, but thee<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>he sought for, and would lie on thy banks and look down<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>at thee, and in the mirror of thy waters he would mirror his<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>own beauty."<lb facs="P9_TL00042"/>And the River answered, "But I loved Narcissus because,<lb facs="P9_TL00043"/>as he lay on my banks and looked down at me, in the mirror<lb facs="P9_TL00044"/>of his eyes I saw ever my own beauty mirrored. Therefore<lb facs="P9_TL00045"/>loved I Narcissus, and therefore must I weep and have my<lb facs="P9_TL00046"/>fill of sorrow, nor can I lend thee a tear."</ab>

Howevet, anybody<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>can see it by just looking in a glass. Perhaps it would be a good<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>thing if it could be used, but it can't.

Some of those children there are<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>undoubtedly orphans. Free range is left to their imagination<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>and their fancy as to whence that warm gift came. To know<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>that one woman among the millions of New York, is good and<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>kind-hearted is not such a comfort to the receiver of the gift,<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>but to think that every one that he meets and who looks<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>at him with kind eyes may be just the one who provided for<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>him his Thanksgiving gift. The anonymous gift to the child,<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>which did not emanate from a certain known society, or a<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>certain individual who has a name, carries a great message:<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>this world, all its inhabitants want me to be comfortable.<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>TÂ© be indebted to the world means to be indebted to each<lb facs="P11_TL00044"/>of its individuals and it is just this indebtedness which makes<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>man square and fair, which makes them brothers of the<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>Golden Rule.</ab>

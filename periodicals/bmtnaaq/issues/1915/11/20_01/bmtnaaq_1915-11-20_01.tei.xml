The prison stood at the foot of Amos (now Tenth)<lb facs="P3_TL00021"/>Street, on the site occupied by the existing brewery, into the<lb facs="P3_TL00022"/>structure of which (as may be seen just inside the Tenth<lb facs="P3_TL00023"/>Street entrance) have been incorporated parts of the old walls.<lb facs="P3_TL00024"/>The buildingâ€”2oo feet long, with wings extending from it at<lb facs="P3_TL00025"/>right angles toward the riverâ€”stood in grounds of about four<lb facs="P3_TL00026"/>acres in extent, the whole enclosed by a stone wall twenty-two<lb facs="P3_TL00027"/>feet high on the side toward the river, and fourteen feet<lb facs="P3_TL00028"/>high elsewhere.<lb facs="P3_TL00029"/>The prison was opened November 28, 1797, when seventy<lb facs="P3_TL00030"/>prisoners were transferred thither, and it continued in use a<lb facs="P3_TL00031"/>little more than thirty years. The male prisoners were trans<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00032"/>ferred to Sing Sing in 1828, and the female prisoners in the<lb facs="P3_TL00033"/>spring of 1829â€”when the entire property was sold into private<lb facs="P3_TL00034"/>hands. This was one of the first prisons in which convicts<lb facs="P3_TL00035"/>were taught trades; but for a long while the more conspicuous<lb facs="P3_TL00036"/>results of this benevolent systemâ€”a feature of which was the<lb facs="P3_TL00037"/>assembling together of the prisoners in large work-rooms, with<lb facs="P3_TL00038"/>consequent abundant opportunities for concocting conspiraciesâ€”<lb facs="P3_TL00039"/>were dangerous plots and mutinous outbreaks. In June 1799,<lb facs="P3_TL00040"/>fifty or sixty men revolted and seized their keepers; and not<lb facs="P3_TL00041"/>until the guards opened fire on them with ball cartridgeâ€”by<lb facs="P3_TL00042"/>which several were wounded, though none were killedâ€”was the<lb facs="P3_TL00043"/>mutiny quelled. In April 1803 about forty men broke from the<lb facs="P3_TL00044"/>prison to the prison-yard, and, after setting fire to the building,<lb facs="P3_TL00045"/>attempted to scale the walls; and again the guards came with<lb facs="P3_TL00046"/>their muskets and compelled orderâ€”this time killing as well as<lb facs="P3_TL00047"/>woundingâ€”while the keepers put out the fire. In May 1804,<lb facs="P3_TL00048"/>a still more dangerous revolt occurred. On this occasion the<lb facs="P3_TL00049"/>keepers were locked into the north wing of the building, which<lb facs="P3_TL00050"/>then was fired. Fortunately, according to a contemporaneous<lb facs="P3_TL00051"/>account, "one more humane than the rest released the keepers<lb facs="P3_TL00052"/>but the north wing was destroyed, involving a loss of $25,000,<lb facs="P3_TL00053"/>and in the confusion many of the prisoners escaped. A long<lb facs="P3_TL00054"/>sigh of thankfulness must have gone up from Greenwich when<lb facs="P3_TL00055"/>this highly volcanic institution became a thing of the past.</ab>

From my first career,<lb facs="P9_TL00004"/>I have always commanded myself.<lb facs="P9_TL00005"/>A man like me is always either a god or a devil.<lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>Nothing has been more simple than my elevation. It was<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>not the result of intrigue or of crime. It was owing to the<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>peculiar circumstances of the times, and because I fought<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>successfully against the enemies of my country. What is more<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>extraordinary, and unparalleled in history, is, that I rose from<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>being a private person to the astonishing height of power I<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>possessed, without having committed a single crime to obtain it.<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>Presence of mind after midnight is so complete with me,<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>that if I am awakened by sudden circumstances, I am wide<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>awake; I get up so that no one can guess by the; state of my<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>eyes if I have just been asleep, and my dictation is as fresh<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>as at any given moment of the day.<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>One of my grand objects was to render education accessible<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>to everybody. I caused every institution to be formed upon a<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>plan which offered instruction to the public, either gratis or at<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>a rate so moderate as not to be? beyond the means of the<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>peasant. The museums were thrown open to the canaille. My<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>canaille would have become the best educated in the world.<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>All my exertions were directed to illuminate the mass of the<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>nation instead of brutifying them by ignorance and superstition.<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>In spite of all the libels I have no fear whatever about my<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>name.

                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>est man that ever existed. As it is, although I have failed, I<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>shall be considered as an extraordinary man. My elevation<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>was unparalleled, because unaccompanied by crime. I have<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>fought fifty pitched battles, almost all of which I have gained.<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>I have framed and carried into effect a code of laws that will<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>bear my name to the most distant posterity. From nothing<lb facs="P9_TL00037"/>I raised myself to be the most powerful monarch in the world.<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>Europe was at my feet. My ambition was great, but it was<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>of cold nature, caused by events and the opinion of great<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>bodies.<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>What I have done will never perish. Twelve hundred years<lb facs="P9_TL00042"/>hence my name will be mentioned with respect, while those of<lb facs="P9_TL00043"/>my oppressors will be unknown or only known by being loaded<lb facs="P9_TL00044"/>with infamy and opprobrium.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00004"/>least one real philosopher is among us. A man who has<lb facs="P5_TL00005"/>no other object in life but to live, and to live means to him<lb facs="P5_TL00006"/>to walk about whenever he pleases to do so, to read books and<lb facs="P5_TL00007"/>his newspapers regularly, and above all, to let the sun shine upon<lb facs="P5_TL00008"/>him every day—not as we do, just to know subconsciously<lb facs="P5_TL00009"/>that the sun is shining because we don't light the gas or turn<lb facs="P5_TL00010"/>on the electric light—but to sit in the golden warm rays and<lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>to feel that there is one glorious sun shining for one man,<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>and that is for himself. In fact, his desire for his daily sun bath<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>made him a philosopher* of life, caused him to give up an<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>occupation and to seek and finally find a way to keep supplied<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>the necessities of mind as well as of his body.<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>For some Jays I had heard early in the morning, in the little<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>alley just below my window, someone chopping wood. At<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>first I didn't know that the noise was caused by chopping wood.<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>Curiosity made me look out of the window, and there was an<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>old man chopping up old boxes and boards into small pieces,<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>bundling the pieces and placing them into paper bags. I went<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>down one morning into the alley and here is the story he<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>told me?: "People are glad if I remove this waste boxes and<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>wood from their premises. I have my regular route on Bleecker<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>street and every Saturday I make a trip down as far as Grand<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>street. It takes me about an hour in the late afternoon to<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>get my supply for the next morning. I fill my bags—at present<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>eight bags every day, but later on in the winter as many as<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>fifteen and twenty. At six o'clock evefry morning, I take them<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>to my regular customers right near by here in the tenement<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>houses. They pay me four cents and five cefnts for each. It's<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>easier for them to buy their fuel from me to cook breakfast,<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>for a few pennies, than to pay half a dollar or a dollar to the<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>coal man for a bigger supply.<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>"I struck on this scheme a couple of years ago, and I never<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>regretted giving up my trade. I was a carpenter and I must<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>say myself that I was pretty good at my trade. I used to earn<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>as high as four and five dollars a day. In those days my wife<lb facs="P5_TL00039"/>was living and later on she was sick and all my savings went<lb facs="P5_TL00040"/>to the druggist and still later I paid hospital bills.

I had no children and it was like<lb facs="P5_TL00043"/>starting a new life. I was out of work for a few weeks. I<lb facs="P5_TL00044"/>walked around in the city. For twenty years I hadn't seen the<lb facs="P5_TL00045"/>city on a week day during business hours. I saw all that life<lb facs="P5_TL00046"/>on the streets. I saw so many things which were strange and<lb facs="P5_TL00047"/>new to me, and I wandered about just seeing things and looking<lb facs="P5_TL00048"/>at people and looking at what they were doing. That was the<lb facs="P5_TL00049"/>time I started to like the sun. All my life had I lived in a<lb facs="P5_TL00050"/>tenement house. When I left in the morning it was usually<lb facs="P5_TL00051"/>dark, and it was dark again when I returned in the evening.<lb facs="P5_TL00052"/>Sundays I would fix things around the house or we would take<lb facs="P5_TL00053"/>a walk.

The rise of the Milburn family fortunes points the moral<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>of a success story such as is seldom recorded in Washington<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>Square annals, where? such a large proportion of foremost<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>families have had what they possess mainly through inheritance.<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>The Milburn family, two generations ago, emigrate?d from<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>England to this country in humble circumstances, settling in<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>Western New York.

At the height of Mr. Milburn, Sr's., success<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>as a practising lawyer in Buffalo, the Milburn family was shot<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>into national prominence by President McKinley's being take?n<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>to their house in Buffalo and dying there. In about the year<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>1904, the? Milburn family removed to this city, John G.

In the recent<lb facs="P11_TL00045"/>campaign it was remarked by various observers how much of his<lb facs="P11_TL00046"/>mother, the former Patty Stocking's teaching ability young<lb facs="P11_TL00047"/>Milburn was the fortunate possessor of, his explanations of the<lb facs="P11_TL00048"/>political situations to the less-instructe?d voters being especially<lb facs="P11_TL00049"/>didactic and helpful.

Most of the younger generation born<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>in the United States, however, knew very few of them. <lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>"The only other vocabulary of American-Romani is that<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>published by Professor Prince in the Journal of the American<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>Oriental Society, to which the present list forms a valuable<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>supplement.<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>"The Romani, the language spoken by the American Gypsies of<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>English descent, is now little more than a broken jargon based<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>grammatically on English.

To have had plays produced in Paris meant ready<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>acceptance by the managers of German theatres.<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>Wagner had been fascinated by the successes of Meyerbeer<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>whose works he felt were inferior to the two acts of The Rienzi<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>which he had composed. He went to Paris.<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>His young wife and his dog accompanied him. He earned his<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>living in re-writing orchestra scores for a publisher and writing<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>articles and criticisms for newspapers and periodicals. But he<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>didn't earn enough to sustain himself in comfort. It was a<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>pitiful struggle and a miserable life—these! three years in Paris.<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>There came a day—the great turning point in Wagner's life.<lb facs="P17_TL00032"/>The rent for his furnished room was due. Credit was exhausted<lb facs="P17_TL00033"/>and he and his wife had not had sufficient food for three days.<lb facs="P17_TL00034"/>He went to the office of the publisher for whom he worked. He<lb facs="P17_TL00035"/>asked for a small loan. He not only got the money and more<lb facs="P17_TL00036"/>than he asked but also an offer which dazed him at first. The<lb facs="P17_TL00037"/>manager of a Paris theatre had purchased one, as he thought,<lb facs="P17_TL00038"/>very promising libretto. He wanted some music written—some<lb facs="P17_TL00039"/>piquant, light, suggestive music,—just the kind Wagner despised.<lb facs="P17_TL00040"/>And the publisher offered Wagner a large amount for writing<lb facs="P17_TL00041"/>this music. There was not only the chance of earning some<lb facs="P17_TL00042"/>money but to gain entrance to the circle of successful managers,<lb facs="P17_TL00043"/>poets and musicians.</ab>

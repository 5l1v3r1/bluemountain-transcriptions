First, there should<lb facs="P31_TL00017"/>be freedom. Any man should be allowed to have<lb facs="P31_TL00018"/>intercourse with a woman who was willing, as long<lb facs="P31_TL00019"/>as they did it for love.

If a mother was<lb facs="P31_TL00021"/>not in a position to or willing to bring up her<lb facs="P31_TL00022"/>child, the State should do it. Of course, when I<lb facs="P31_TL00023"/>say there should be freedom, I do not say that, if<lb facs="P31_TL00024"/>one man was living with a woman (legally, of<lb facs="P31_TL00025"/>course, as all such relations would be legal with<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

There should be no coercion on either side.<lb facs="P31_TL00033"/>The woman should have the care of her children<lb facs="P31_TL00034"/>if she so desired, but if unable to take care of them,</ab>

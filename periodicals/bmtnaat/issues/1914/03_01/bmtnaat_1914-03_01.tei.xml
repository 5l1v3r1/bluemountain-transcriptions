There was<lb facs="P116_TL00007"/>an awkward pause.<lb facs="P116_TL00008"/>Nielsen gave her a sidelong glance. What could<lb facs="P116_TL00009"/>he do? This was dreadful. He should not have<lb facs="P116_TL00010"/>gone so far. Erna was staring at the floor. He<lb facs="P116_TL00011"/>could see her pugnacious nose and her determined<lb facs="P116_TL00012"/>mouth and chin, and felt somewhat relieved. Her<lb facs="P116_TL00013"/>case might not be as serious as he feared. She had<lb facs="P116_TL00014"/>tenacious strength of character. But the situation<lb facs="P116_TL00015"/>was very uncomfortable notwithstanding. He should<lb facs="P116_TL00016"/>not have gone so far. It was selfish—whether a<lb facs="P116_TL00017"/>man's selfishness or an artist's. Nielsen turned<lb facs="P116_TL00018"/>away.<lb facs="P116_TL00019"/>Again, he glanced in her direction, but she was<lb facs="P116_TL00020"/>still staring at the floor.

They were suited to each<lb facs="P116_TL00024"/>other. What could or should she have to do with<lb facs="P116_TL00025"/>such a thing as an artist? Perhaps, the novelty in<lb facs="P116_TL00026"/>their short affair had appealed to her. She was a<lb facs="P116_TL00027"/>greedy nature.

And to lovers of poetry it offers each month<lb facs="P135_TL00023"/>a sheaf of new verse in delicate form uninterrupted by<lb facs="P135_TL00024"/>prose articles demanding a different mood.<lb facs="P135_TL00025"/>If You Love Good Poetry, Subscribe—<lb facs="P135_TL00026"/>POETRY<lb facs="P135_TL00027"/>543 Cass Street, Chicago.<lb facs="P135_TL00028"/>Send POETRY for one year ($1.50 enclosed) beginning<lb facs="P135_TL00029"/>to<lb facs="P135_TL00030"/>Name<lb facs="P135_TL00031"/>Address</ab>

The same morning she traveled back<lb facs="P27_TL00013"/>here and came to see me in prison.

So there we lay<lb facs="P27_TL00022"/>in one room in the contagious ward behind the hospital,<lb facs="P27_TL00023"/>and from the first day Geschwitz put forth all her art to<lb facs="P27_TL00024"/>make our two faces as like each other as possible. Day<lb facs="P27_TL00025"/>before yesterday she was let out as cured. Just now<lb facs="P27_TL00026"/>she came back and said she'd forgotten her watch. I put<lb facs="P27_TL00027"/>on her clothes, she slipped into my prison frock, and then<lb facs="P27_TL00028"/>I came away. (With pleasure.) Now she's lying over<lb facs="P27_TL00029"/>there as the murderess of Dr. Schon.<lb facs="P27_TL00030"/>ALVA.

With me<lb facs="P28_TL00016"/>there's the closest alternation between my sensuality and<lb facs="P28_TL00017"/>mental creativeness.

Yet if it weren't for your two great, dark, childish<lb facs="P29_TL00024"/>eyes, I must needs have thought you the cunningest<lb facs="P29_TL00025"/>whore that ever hurled a man to destruction.<lb facs="P29_TL00026"/>LULU. {ln high spirits.)

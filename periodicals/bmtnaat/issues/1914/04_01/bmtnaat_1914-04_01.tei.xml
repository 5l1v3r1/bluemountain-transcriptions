So they<lb facs="P76_TL00005"/>seize the pictures to save art. And the operas<lb facs="P76_TL00006"/>and symphonies to save music. You are to be<lb facs="P76_TL00007"/>saved by being denied everything. If they gave<lb facs="P76_TL00008"/>you anything you'd be lost. They are safe from<lb facs="P76_TL00009"/>luxury no matter how much they have. You are<lb facs="P76_TL00010"/>in peril of luxury no matter how little you have.<lb facs="P76_TL00011"/>They fool you with their paraphernalia. You<lb facs="P76_TL00012"/>are awed not by their brains but by what they<lb facs="P76_TL00013"/>tell you of their brains. You take their word<lb facs="P76_TL00014"/>for it.

You<lb facs="P76_TL00021"/>must have the poor with you always because you<lb facs="P76_TL00022"/>must have the rich with you always. Who would<lb facs="P76_TL00023"/>save the poor if the rich didn't ? And if the poor<lb facs="P76_TL00024"/>were not saved what would become of the rich?<lb facs="P76_TL00025"/>The great you have with you always. You must<lb facs="P76_TL00026"/>have the little with you always because you must<lb facs="P76_TL00027"/>have the big with you always.

Thus:<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>Three men in a room, towards night. Two of them<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>sat in the cold, sprawled somewhat, and with their<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>overcoats on. The third was huddled in a Morris-chair,<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>knees up to his chin, looking down over his toes at<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>the vague carpet. „Do you think she will come?" one<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>of the other two asked. He swallowed, and noticed<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>that his throat was getting sore. For a while they<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>shifted slightly, in silence. (As the room grew darker,<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>no one had moved to light the lamps.) The sounds<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>outside came in dampened by the snow.<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>„We should have started a fire when we first got<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>here", the first man said, yawning. „If we're going<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>to wait around here we might as well be comfortable."<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>„Too late now, she'll be along any minute."<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>The man hunched up in the Morris-chair sniffled<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>three or four times, and then blew his nose. „Ah, what<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>a bitter world!" one of the others laughed. „Look, the<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>poor devil had to move." ...

The man who had swallowed a little while<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>ago brought up some saliva and swallowed again, to<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>test his throat; the glands were distinctly swollen.

So he had been there during<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>the winter, exposed to the cold and without food;<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>and when he died the trap weighted him so that he<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>stood up as chestily as the healthiest crow you ever<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>saw. . . .

Instead, he went into<lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>the park, and stamped about in the heavy snow, even<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>walked across one of the ponds, in fact. A gust of<lb facs="P11_TL00018"/>wind hit him strong enough for him to rise up against<lb facs="P11_TL00019"/>it, and yell into the teeth of it.

Even the beds on which the people<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>sleep are granite slabs, built in square holes carved<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>out of the walls.

Broad stairs,<lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>the width of a palace in his own country, led down<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>to a platform, then down to a platform, and so on<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>down and down to platforms. All this was lit with a<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>uniform incandescence. While at the base of the stairs<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>there stood two granite lamp posts, of no great size,<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>but which he could distinguish as clearly as though<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>they were immediately in front of him.<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>But Yul did not descend these stairs.</ab>

It was composed of<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>sixteen parallel tracks, or rather, endless platforms,<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>which moved continually.

                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>form to platform was hardly more abrupt than the<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>difference between the pace of of a baby just learning<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>to walk and the ordinary walking-speed of a grown-up,<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>by the time Yul had reached the fifteenth platform to<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>the south he was speeding enormously. The sixteenth<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>platform, however, was entirely different from the fifteen<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>preceding. To begin with, he found that it could not<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>be boarded at any point, as with the other platforms.<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>In front of him there moved a stone wall; occasionally,<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>behind this waH he heard a roar, as of something which<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>approached and retreated.

It advanced evenly, floated<lb facs="P13_TL00006"/>towards them, growing gradually above them as it<lb facs="P13_TL00007"/>came. When it was only a short ways off, he also<lb facs="P13_TL00008"/>noticed that there was a break in the stone wall at<lb facs="P13_TL00009"/>this point, and that some of the figures farther down<lb facs="P13_TL00010"/>the platform were already entering there, indue time<lb facs="P13_TL00011"/>it reached him, and he stepped under the square stone<lb facs="P13_TL00012"/>arch on to the sixteenth platform. Everything was<lb facs="P13_TL00013"/>quite different here. Instead of the stone benches,<lb facs="P13_TL00014"/>pavements, kiosks, there was nothing but this lonely<lb facs="P13_TL00015"/>tower and a straight steel track that blurred away to<lb facs="P13_TL00016"/>the east and west. Like the others, he entered the<lb facs="P13_TL00017"/>tower, and found it a sort of rest room or waiting<lb facs="P13_TL00018"/>room.<lb facs="P13_TL00019"/>Finally, above the grinding of the platforms, a<lb facs="P13_TL00020"/>far-off whirr was heard. The grey-clad figures left the<lb facs="P13_TL00021"/>tower, Yul thinking it best to follow. A line of cars<lb facs="P13_TL00022"/>shot up to the tower and stopped. Yul followed his<lb facs="P13_TL00023"/>companions into one of the cars, and they sped along<lb facs="P13_TL00024"/>the sixteenth platform. Yul sank into a stupor from this<lb facs="P13_TL00025"/>accumulation of speeds, partaking of nothing but a<lb facs="P13_TL00026"/>bitter, burning liquid which was brought to him at<lb facs="P13_TL00027"/>intervals. After another two days, Yul tired of the cars,<lb facs="P13_TL00028"/>and descended at one of the towers. Then he crossed<lb facs="P13_TL00029"/>the fifteen other platforms to the north, and found,<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>when he stepped off the last of them, that he had<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>returned almost to the starting point*.<lb facs="P13_TL00032"/>He came to the wide street again, and entered one<lb facs="P13_TL00033"/>of the oblong cuts in the stone which served as doorways.<lb facs="P13_TL00034"/>Inside, there were winding stairs, lit with the same<lb facs="P13_TL00035"/>unvarying incandescence that he had noticed on the<lb facs="P13_TL00036"/>stairs leading down to the buried cities. Yul wound<lb facs="P13_TL00037"/>slowly upwards, his steps slapping back at him in a<lb facs="P13_TL00038"/>confusion of echoes. The stairs curved into a room;<lb facs="P13_TL00039"/>a large, square room, empty except for a tablet on one</ab>

He walked farther and saw a floor<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>of white marble, dipping in a slow curve toward a<lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>stage or altar in the distance. Yul fell upon his knees<lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>and wept, this quiet curve was so soothing to him.<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>Looking above him, he saw that here, too, there were<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>curves; the walls reaching up thin arms of broken<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>arches; a ceiling behind shadows, and vaulted; and<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>thick wooden beams that worked among one another<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>like a mass of human bodies.

He arose, and began putting aside his<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>clothes, until finally he stood naked in the middle of<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>the vast, empty church.

But she picked up the clothes which<lb facs="P15_TL00009"/>he had thrown off and held them out to him, so that<lb facs="P15_TL00010"/>Yul put them all back upon his body. When he had<lb facs="P15_TL00011"/>dressed, he stood in front of her, and looked into her<lb facs="P15_TL00012"/>eyes. They were big- and deep, like lakes, for he could<lb facs="P15_TL00013"/>see down into the rich black pupils as though they<lb facs="P15_TL00014"/>really were made of water. She took him by the hand<lb facs="P15_TL00015"/>and led him toward the altar, until Yul threw back his<lb facs="P15_TL00016"/>head and sang. But his notes began lingering and<lb facs="P15_TL00017"/>grumbling to one another among the beams, so that<lb facs="P15_TL00018"/>he quit singing. . . . He was led to the edge of the<lb facs="P15_TL00019"/>altar. Then she let go his hand, and jumped. Looking<lb facs="P15_TL00020"/>where she had jumped, Yul saw that she had leapt<lb facs="P15_TL00021"/>across a pit in the centre of the altar. He looked down<lb facs="P15_TL00022"/>into this pit; it was dark, but so far below that it<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>made him shudder he could see the incandescence of<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>the lowest of the buried cities. Then he jumped and<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>followed his companion on the other side of the altar.<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>For a time they labored along together, down steps<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>into cold damp places; around sudden bends into<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>rooms which were warm and brilliant; through some<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>narrow passage with a rough, pebbly bottom; then<lb facs="P15_TL00030"/>across a little stone bridge under which a spring flowed<lb facs="P15_TL00031"/>out of the rock and back into it. But of a sudden<lb facs="P15_TL00032"/>she stopped and opened her arms to him. Yul closed<lb facs="P15_TL00033"/>against her, looking into the roads and caverns of her<lb facs="P15_TL00034"/>eyes. She stepped away, tore back her garments with<lb facs="P15_TL00035"/>one fling of her hand . . . and Yul crumpled on the<lb facs="P15_TL00036"/>ground under the impact of his disgust.

One afternoon as i went out, i was<lb facs="P20_TL00005"/>astonished at being- made to wait at the door 2or 3<lb facs="P20_TL00006"/>minutes. Mr. Aa was sitting- on a chest. She begged<lb facs="P20_TL00007"/>me, laughing, not to be disturbed. The chest was full<lb facs="P20_TL00008"/>of objects of great value. She said that she had not<lb facs="P20_TL00009"/>heard me knock. The coroner entered. Zounds! i cried,<lb facs="P20_TL00010"/>you are weeping, you are moved to the point of tears and<lb facs="P20_TL00011"/>you do not breathe a word to me of your troubles. The<lb facs="P20_TL00012"/>persons who attended the coroner guarded the doors. The<lb facs="P20_TL00013"/>thought of this also aroused me. The coroner was a<lb facs="P20_TL00014"/>young man. It was clear to me that some generous<lb facs="P20_TL00015"/>and ardent sentiment functioned upon his face like a<lb facs="P20_TL00016"/>smouldering fire, though whether it were of love or<lb facs="P20_TL00017"/>compassion i could not say. The coroner tapped the<lb facs="P20_TL00018"/>objects in the chest and tested their stability. I sat<lb facs="P20_TL00019"/>down at the table with a right gallant air, but by the<lb facs="P20_TL00020"/>light of the candle betwixt him and me i perceived a<lb facs="P20_TL00021"/>certain sadness in the countenance and in the eyes of<lb facs="P20_TL00022"/>my dear friend the coroner. He bent and looked down<lb facs="P20_TL00023"/>very often but said nothing. He marked out the place with<lb facs="P20_TL00024"/>silent powder and thus circumvented the danger. The<lb facs="P20_TL00025"/>coroner gave orders. These orders seemed as lugubrious<lb facs="P20_TL00026"/>to me as the perverse brilliance of this festive gaiety.<lb facs="P20_TL00027"/>He related to me that after having learned that i had<lb facs="P20_TL00028"/>deceived him, and that i had gone off with Mr. Aa,<lb facs="P20_TL00029"/>he had mounted a horse to pursue me, that he had<lb facs="P20_TL00030"/>arrived at St. Denis a half hour after my departure,<lb facs="P20_TL00031"/>that being certain that i would stop at Paris he had<lb facs="P20_TL00032"/>spent 6 weeks in a vain search for me, and that one<lb facs="P20_TL00033"/>day he had recognized Mr. Aa at the Comedy, and<lb facs="P20_TL00034"/>that he was so bravely dressed that he concluded the<lb facs="P20_TL00035"/>man owed this fortune to a new haul in scrap iron<lb facs="P20_TL00036"/>the returns of which had filled his money-bags with<lb facs="P20_TL00037"/>palliative warmth.

What torture to have the door<lb facs="P23_TL00012"/>close upon one in the midst of a sentence. It were<lb facs="P23_TL00013"/>almost relief to finish the thought without an audition.<lb facs="P23_TL00014"/>Heavens! The man was like a panther: he darted<lb facs="P23_TL00015"/>calumny, abuse, derision at you, held the stump for<lb facs="P23_TL00016"/>an hour, and when you framed your defense, interrupted<lb facs="P23_TL00017"/>you and went off in a petty squall. Well, what of that?<lb facs="P23_TL00018"/>Hyacinth still owed him money. He would have to<lb facs="P23_TL00019"/>calm down and come back for it.

Again, a blackness,<lb facs="P23_TL00004"/>obviously symbolic, of heavy clouds had gathered<lb facs="P23_TL00005"/>over the sky; and having gathered, these clouds lay<lb facs="P23_TL00006"/>there like a threat. In the late afternoon the clouds .<lb facs="P23_TL00007"/>were split to expose a sun which was already part<lb facs="P23_TL00008"/>eaten by the shadow of the moon, and which dropped<lb facs="P23_TL00009"/>below the horizon in full shadow. Thus, without twilight,<lb facs="P23_TL00010"/>midnight followed on the heels of day, while the storm<lb facs="P23_TL00011"/>broke, slashing and stumbling in the dark, and rocking<lb facs="P23_TL00012"/>the monastery like a ship.<lb facs="P23_TL00013"/>The forces of sin silently multiplied, filling his brain<lb facs="P23_TL00014"/>with their progeny after the manner of vipers.

Maddened by her<lb facs="P23_TL00020"/>pleasures, the wife then slays her lover by ripping<lb facs="P23_TL00021"/>open his throat with her teeth; while as he perishes,<lb facs="P23_TL00022"/>she drinks in his spittle. Thus, the father is consumed<lb facs="P23_TL00023"/>during the excesses, but the sperm of his spittle still<lb facs="P23_TL00024"/>remains to destroy the mother.

Another<lb facs="P24_TL00021"/>voice near him piped up in prayer.

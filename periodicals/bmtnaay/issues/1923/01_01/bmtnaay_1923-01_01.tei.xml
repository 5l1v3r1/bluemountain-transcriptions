                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00004"/>With an uncertain tide — or better, current, since<lb facs="P7_TL00005"/>I am speaking of a little lake, or an enormous spring,<lb facs="P7_TL00006"/>or some sort of underground river — I simply took<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>all chances and allowed myself to drift. For the most<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>part it was black; me lying in the bottom of the boat,<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>conscious by means of some complicated mechanism<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>of sensation, or rather, some peculiar centralization<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>from divers termini, of a gentle motion; the boat<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>scraping now and then against an unseen rock that<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>jutted up, or perhaps the sides of the cavern. Once or<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>twice I passed a little ball of pale blueish light,<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>however. A crunching sound. The boat had grounded<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>on pebbles. Feeling in the dark, I stepped out on a<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>smooth bank which began to ascend immediatety. I<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>said farewell to my boat — perhaps forever! — and<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>began climbing. It soon became rough and jagged,<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>like a sieve for grinding nutmeg, then narrowed after<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>the manner of an inverted funnel, and finally was<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>almost as steep as a perpendicular cylinder. ... I had<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>to stop, for I had come upon a wall, a smooth, flat<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>surface; and further, I was exhausted. I dropped where<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>I lay, fell into a sort of stupor, and when I regained<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>consciousness it was owing to faint irregular taps<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>coming from far beneath me and forcing themselves<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>upon my notice. It was my boat, broken from its<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>moorings, starting easily on its way!<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>I cursed the foolhardiness that had got me into<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>this thing. And I confess that I even wept, for the<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>feeling of desolation and loneliness which came over<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>me was too powerful for resistance. Then I remem<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

A new courage poured<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>into me like wine, and I recommenced examining the<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>wall.

                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>ness of it was broken by cracks large enough for<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>me to insert my fingers, and the ascent continued.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00002"/>As I climbed, it began slowly to dawn in the<lb facs="P8_TL00003"/>cavern. (The noonday sun of the countryside above,<lb facs="P8_TL00004"/>that is, was penetrating through some cavity into these<lb facs="P8_TL00005"/>depths.) I came upon the first sickly weeds, a few<lb facs="P8_TL00006"/>beetles, worms and the like. And it was not long<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>before I was in full daylight, struggling through a thick<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>underbrush which was so luxuriant, so impenetrable,<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>that I almost wished for the cool desolation of mv<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>cavern. Working among the briars, especially the<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>insistent blackberries — insistent because they seemed<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>to be actually reaching out to catch the wool of my<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>coat — I came upon a cluster of sumac, and then an<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>even thicker muddle of ferns and alders. As the<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>ground was unusually rough, my feet would slip from<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>the rocks, and lodging in some unnoticed cavity<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>covered with dead leaves, they would be held there by<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>a tangle of roots, while at the same time I was kept<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>busy dodging beneath the low crooked branches,<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>making detours, or creeping through chance holes<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>in the foliage. And then of a sudden I broke through<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>to a road, and looked across broad easy meadows . . .<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>and why! there was the house where Treep used<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>to live!<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>And that stump in front of Treep's house, that<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>was where the oak used to be which Treep had loved<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>so much and then his master had ordered him to cut<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>it down. Treep used to go out and pat the shaggy<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>bark of this oak while it was still standing. But his<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>master said finally, "Treep, cut down the oak." Since<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>it was decided that the oak was needed for timber.<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>Before that Treep had even felt that long after he was<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>dead the oak would stand there; but now the oak had<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>to be chopped down, and Treep went out with his<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>axe to chop it.<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>No one was near, however, so that Treep rubbed<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>his head against it, and explained how unhappy he<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>would be without it, and how he would hollow out the<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>stump and plant therein some of its own acorns.<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>Then, after weeping, he attacked the trunk with his axe.<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>But as he swung his axe, it caught in a low<lb facs="P8_TL00042"/>branch which was sagging somewhat, Treep being<lb facs="P8_TL00043"/>knocked on his back by the rebound of this branch.<lb facs="P8_TL00044"/>At first he was angry; but he said that it was right</ab>

When he returned to chopping, however, a<lb facs="P9_TL00004"/>rotten branch from high up in the tree became<lb facs="P9_TL00005"/>dislodged, and cut a gash in the nape of Treep's neck.<lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>"Thou ungrateful oak!" he shouted in anger; "Thou<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>must know that it is not my fault that I must kill thee,,<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>and thus not place the added burden of thine own<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>disobedience upon a heart which is already weighted<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>down by the necessity of fulfilling a loathsome<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>command put upon it by my master!" And Treep<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>resumed his task.<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>But as the axe sank into the trunk, a large chip<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>of wood flew up, striking Treep full on the forehead,<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>so that the blood poured down into his eyes. Treep<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>arose at one leap, regained his axe, and began<lb facs="P9_TL00017"/>brandishing it about his head. "Oak!" he shrieked;<lb facs="P9_TL00018"/>"Oak! Thou art no longer the big friendly thing that<lb facs="P9_TL00019"/>I rubbed my ears against and hugged with my arms,<lb facs="P9_TL00020"/>but a monument of malice and spitefulness rising<lb facs="P9_TL00021"/>between me and the commands of my master. And<lb facs="P9_TL00022"/>the love I bore for thee now being completely<lb facs="P9_TL00023"/>vanished, I swear by the blood dripping from my<lb facs="P9_TL00024"/>forehead that I shall attack thee in all ferocity, not<lb facs="P9_TL00025"/>stopping until thou lyest a corpse at my feet!"<lb facs="P9_TL00026"/>And then Treep assailed the oak with bitterness,<lb facs="P9_TL00027"/>half blinded by the blood from his forehead, his body<lb facs="P9_TL00028"/>aching and tired, but sustained with such a vengeance<lb facs="P9_TL00029"/>against his old friend that he hardly knew what he<lb facs="P9_TL00030"/>was doing. Indeed, blinded as he was by the flow<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>of both his blood and his emotions, and although a<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>practised woodsman, he was not felling the oak<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>properly. And1 when at last it became so weakened<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>that it began to topple, he saw that it was falling<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>toward his master's garden. At this point he was<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>plunged into an inordinate hate; he did not even take<lb facs="P9_TL00037"/>into account the enormous mass of his enemy, but<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>as the oak began leaning with increasing rapidity, he<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>hurled aside his axe, and heaved his shoulders against<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>the falling trunk, trying in this way to change the<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>direction of its fall!<lb facs="P9_TL00042"/>But the oak continued on its descent, and as it<lb facs="P9_TL00043"/>stretched out along the ground it held Treep beneath<lb facs="P9_TL00044"/>it, crushing the life out of him almost instantaneouslv.<lb facs="P9_TL00045"/>%/</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P10_TL00003"/>Treep was aware of no change whatsoever, except<lb facs="P10_TL00004"/>that he was growing. Soon his hand alone was as big<lb facs="P10_TL00005"/>as his whole body had been, with the rest of him<lb facs="P10_TL00006"/>increased proportionately; and soon after this his hand<lb facs="P10_TL00007"/>was as big as his new body had been . . . and so on,<lb facs="P10_TL00008"/>indeterminately. When he had ceased increasing, he<lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>looked about, stretched his arms which were as thick as<lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>a countryside; and opening his jaws, he yawned as wide<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>as a gulf. But he was conscious of a pain beneath the<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>nail of his right little toe; and reaching down he pulled<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>out a splinter, the oak which had killed him . . . This<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>had been the magnification of Treep.<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>Noticing that the sky was only a few arm-lengths<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>above him, he sprang into the air, caught hold, and<lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>hoisted himself on to the other side. The country<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>was rough but comparatively level. Glistening in the<lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>distance there was something which looked very much<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>like a palace. He made off in this direction.<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>As he came nearer he could distinguish figures<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>moving about, all of them as big as he was himself.<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>Then messengers came ahead to meet him, small, the<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>way he had been before death, and they perched on<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>his shoulders like doves. They explained that they<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>were the former poets of the earth, and that this was<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>Heaven, and that they were usually the only earthly<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>existences admitted here. But Wawl had seen Treep's<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>struggle with the oak, and had decreed that he should<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>be magnified among the gods, and then they all fell<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>to singing their own compositions at once. He walked<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>ahead, not much disturbed by their twitter, until one<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>of them climbed into the shell of his ear and explained,<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>shouting above the others, the dilemma which Wawl<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>had occasioned by his deification. For in magnifying<lb facs="P10_TL00036"/>Treep it was not found possible to magnify his name,<lb facs="P10_TL00037"/>and there were no more names nor offices left in<lb facs="P10_TL00038"/>Heaven. Wawl had decided, however, that if Treep<lb facs="P10_TL00039"/>dared he might attack any god he so desired, and if<lb facs="P10_TL00040"/>he defeated this god could usurp both his name and<lb facs="P10_TL00041"/>office. Treep asked the poet what gods were disliked<lb facs="P10_TL00042"/>in Heaven, and the poet mentioned both Arjk and the<lb facs="P10_TL00043"/>Blizzard God. Arjk, it went on to say, was undoubtedly</ab>

Treep<lb facs="P11_TL00005"/>decided that it was Arjk whom he would battle; and<lb facs="P11_TL00006"/>halting outside the castle, he sent word to Wawl that<lb facs="P11_TL00007"/>his faithful servant Arjk was approaching.<lb facs="P11_TL00008"/>Soon a distant tumult was heard, and the poets<lb facs="P11_TL00009"/>in a panic scrambled down from Treep's shoulders.<lb facs="P11_TL00010"/>Then Arjk appeared, growling and cursing, and<lb facs="P11_TL00011"/>demanding to know if this was the thief and liar who<lb facs="P11_TL00012"/>was adorning himself with the name of a god. Treep<lb facs="P11_TL00013"/>answered him, "Step aside, Treep, for I am Arjk, the<lb facs="P11_TL00014"/>faithful servant of Wawl, and I have come to pay<lb facs="P11_TL00015"/>him homage." Thereupon the two of them closed in<lb facs="P11_TL00016"/>upon each other, a battle following which lasted for<lb facs="P11_TL00017"/>two years.

Arjk entered and bowed before him.<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>About the feet of Wawl adoring women sat, their<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>breasts dripping at his glory, indeed, their entire<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>bodies flowing with love of their Lord.

Wawl<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>peered through the mist wavering before his eyes, and<lb facs="P11_TL00035"/>raised his voice above the small but distracting<lb facs="P11_TL00036"/>thunder.<lb facs="P11_TL00037"/>"Arjk," Wawl addressed him, "thou art the most<lb facs="P11_TL00038"/>mighty of my warriors."<lb facs="P11_TL00039"/>"Whatever strength I possess was granted me by<lb facs="P11_TL00040"/>Wawl."<lb facs="P11_TL00041"/>"1 trust that thou wilt remain faithful to me, for<lb facs="P11_TL00042"/>thy powers, if turned against me, could cause all<lb facs="P11_TL00043"/>manner of evil in Heaven."</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P12_TL00001"/>And Arjk, bowing even lower, answered with<lb facs="P12_TL00002"/>emotion, "Before everything else comes my gratitude<lb facs="P12_TL00003"/>to Wawl. In the magnification of Treep there was<lb facs="P12_TL00004"/>also the magnification of Treep's devotion. And this<lb facs="P12_TL00005"/>devotion is mortgaged solely to Wawl." And then<lb facs="P12_TL00006"/>rising to his feet, Arjk gave way to his elation, and<lb facs="P12_TL00007"/>sang to Wawl of the glories which he, Arjk, had<lb facs="P12_TL00008"/>accomplished in Heaven, and of the might and<lb facs="P12_TL00009"/>splendor which belonged to him, Arjk. Saying among<lb facs="P12_TL00010"/>other things, "I, Treep become Arjk, can drink and<lb facs="P12_TL00011"/>carouse in Heaven and yet retain the most powerful<lb facs="P12_TL00012"/>arm among the gods." The elation continuing, Arjk<lb facs="P12_TL00013"/>took leave of Wawl, and went for a mad ride in his<lb facs="P12_TL00014"/>chariot, hurling bolts haphazard out of Heaven, and<lb facs="P12_TL00015"/>shouting to the rattle of his steeds' hoofs across the<lb facs="P12_TL00016"/>clouds.<lb facs="P12_TL00017"/>Then of a sudden Arjk spied the Blizzard God<lb facs="P12_TL00018"/>riding in the distance. And looking closer, he<lb facs="P12_TL00019"/>distinguished Hyelva fleeing before him, her white<lb facs="P12_TL00020"/>robes fluttering back in confused vibrations. Arjk<lb facs="P12_TL00021"/>wrenched his steeds until they were headed toward<lb facs="P12_TL00022"/>the Blizzard God, and his chariot went swaying and<lb facs="P12_TL00023"/>rocking back and forth across the clouds. The<lb facs="P12_TL00024"/>Blizzard God was shrieking as he pursued, "Hyelva!<lb facs="P12_TL00025"/>Hyelva, open the great gate of thy body! The great<lb facs="P12_TL00026"/>gate of thy body, that I may enter in!" while the hoofs<lb facs="P12_TL00027"/>of Arjk's horses set up a reverberation through Heaven&gt;<lb facs="P12_TL00028"/>Hell and Earth. But Hyelva sped on in silence.<lb facs="P12_TL00029"/>It became evident that Arjk would overtake the<lb facs="P12_TL00030"/>Blizzard God and rescue Hyelva from his fingers. But<lb facs="P12_TL00031"/>Littic, who was a kindly deity, though under the<lb facs="P12_TL00032"/>domination of the Blizzard God, released his lights<lb facs="P12_TL00033"/>through Heaven, so that both Arjk and his horses<lb facs="P12_TL00034"/>were blinded. Letting his reins slacken in his stupoi\<lb facs="P12_TL00035"/>Arjk watched the lights play on all sides of him, saw<lb facs="P12_TL00036"/>the thick trunks of flame with tongues protruding, or<lb facs="P12_TL00037"/>semi-circles stretching across the whole sky, with balls<lb facs="P12_TL00038"/>of a blueish jelly sliding along them, or puffs of light,<lb facs="P12_TL00039"/>waving like dust toward the zenith. And while Arjk<lb facs="P12_TL00040"/>relaxed, enchanted, the Blizzard God sent a broadside<lb facs="P12_TL00041"/>of tempest against him, blowing him out of the chariot<lb facs="P12_TL00042"/>and the bolts from his hands.

As<lb facs="P14_TL00007"/>he came out into the blizzard, hat-less and coat-less,<lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>he could see nothing of her.

He returned to his apartment<lb facs="P14_TL00010"/>slowly, even stopped in the dark kitchen a few<lb facs="P14_TL00011"/>moments and leaned against the wall.* Then he went<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>to the front room where Harowitz was waiting for<lb facs="P14_TL00013"/>him.<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>Harowitz was moving about the room, from one<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>island to another.

Harowitz wore a size<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>eight shoe, carried a cane, could speak both French<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>and German fluently. His left eye was weaker than<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>his right, but not enough to necessitate his wearing<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>glasses. He was not married, had graduated from a<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>law school magna cum laude, and also knew some<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>Spanish. On his mother's side he was not full Jew.<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>Or perhaps Hobbes would have waited until<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>Harowitz had begun to explain something, such as<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>"The perfection of machinery, and the consequent<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>large-quantity production, has made war an absolute<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>necessity for the first time in the world's history."<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>Then Hobbes would answer, "Yes, Harowitz, quite<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>right, but what would you think of a man who walked<lb facs="P14_TL00038"/>into your house and when you weren't watching him<lb facs="P14_TL00039"/>went into your cupboard, and stole a drink of<lb facs="P14_TL00040"/>whiskey?"<lb facs="P14_TL00041"/>It was not the drink of whiskey that Hobbes had<lb facs="P14_TL00042"/>minded. It was the principle of the thing. But he<lb facs="P14_TL00043"/>said nothing to Harowitz. The statement, after all,<lb facs="P14_TL00044"/>would be too blunt, so blunt that even if Harowitz</ab>

After a time they were not clear-headed;<lb facs="P15_TL00023"/>the mixture of whiskey, gas fumes and old breath had<lb facs="P15_TL00024"/>taken the freshness out of them. They watched each<lb facs="P15_TL00025"/>other now and then with tired eyes, trying to become<lb facs="P15_TL00026"/>interested in some assertion. Harowitz left within an<lb facs="P15_TL00027"/>hour, while Hobbes continued to lie on the couch.<lb facs="P15_TL00028"/>Hobbes listened to the soft pads of snow flattening<lb facs="P15_TL00029"/>against the windows.

Less waste of time<lb facs="P31_TL00008"/>were these opinions formulated not to remind editors<lb facs="P31_TL00009"/>of their failings, but to serve as a sine hoc non for the<lb facs="P31_TL00010"/>selection of a group who would make comment on<lb facs="P31_TL00011"/>arty and forward looking journalism superfluous. The<lb facs="P31_TL00012"/>editorial is itself a very pat instance of "combative<lb facs="P31_TL00013"/>recognition of stupidity." To discern the faults of<lb facs="P31_TL00014"/>others is not always to avoid them one's self.

Yet were not prophecy rash<lb facs="P31_TL00028"/>for the unelect, I should predict that Secession, despite<lb facs="P31_TL00029"/>its name, is to combine the virtues of the Little Review<lb facs="P31_TL00030"/>with those virtues which it has not, and if only by talk<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

                                    <lb facs="P34_TL00017"/>On reading Herwarth Walden's Kunstdammerung<lb facs="P34_TL00018"/>in Der Sturm (13th year, No. 7—B) one asks himself<lb facs="P34_TL00019"/>with distress whether two parties of reaction are<lb facs="P34_TL00020"/>fighting for dictatorship of the arts. There is the<lb facs="P34_TL00021"/>retour element, pleading for an art which will have<lb facs="P34_TL00022"/>a more fundamental relationship with life; and over<lb facs="P34_TL00023"/>against it, there is the struggle to preserve the<lb facs="P34_TL00024"/>exclusively esthetic point of view. Says Herr Walden,<lb facs="P34_TL00025"/>defending the latter, "The man who requires the<lb facs="P34_TL00026"/>representation of water in order to see a blue<lb facs="P34_TL00027"/>completely lacks the artistic eye. If, when placed<lb facs="P34_TL00028"/>before a colour, one must think something before he<lb facs="P34_TL00029"/>can experience it, he is without any colour sense<lb facs="P34_TL00030"/>whatever. A colour is not received in the soul, but in<lb facs="P34_TL00031"/>the eye. Everything else is simply the association of<lb facs="P34_TL00032"/>the subject." Walden's message is strenuous and<lb facs="P34_TL00033"/>accurate throughout, but the reader is not compelled<lb facs="P34_TL00034"/>to accept it. The choice lies between retaining a<lb facs="P34_TL00035"/>method found within the last twenty years, or so, and<lb facs="P34_TL00036"/>recovering a method which has sat upon Europe for<lb facs="P34_TL00037"/>whole centuries ... In this same issue, and the one<lb facs="P34_TL00038"/>preceding, there is a remarkable article by Jorg Mager<lb facs="P34_TL00039"/>on the quarter-tone scale, containing documents on</ab>

Man's business is primarily<lb facs="P35_TL00017"/>that of the slayer; is not the word his best weapon for<lb facs="P35_TL00018"/>the slaying of emotions, by transferring them into<lb facs="P35_TL00019"/>adequate ideas?

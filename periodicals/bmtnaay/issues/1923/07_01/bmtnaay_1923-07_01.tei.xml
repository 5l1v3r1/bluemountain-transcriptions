                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00003"/>A complete study of Cummings should take penetrating account of his<lb facs="P4_TL00004"/>painting and drawing, and no estimate of his literary work can begin without<lb facs="P4_TL00005"/>noting the important fact that Cummings is a painter. It has bearings, as we<lb facs="P4_TL00006"/>shall later see, on his written word's. Cummings creates perfect lyrics, and<lb facs="P4_TL00007"/>a perfect lyric is indefinable and unalyzable. The nearest we can come to it<lb facs="P4_TL00008"/>beyond a subjective recognition and feeling is to say, as Cummings wrote of<lb facs="P4_TL00009"/>the Mountain by Gaston Lachaise and of the personality of Jean Le Negre,<lb facs="P4_TL00010"/>that the perfect lyric is a verb : it is an is. But to admit the impregnability<lb facs="P4_TL00011"/>of the lyric is not necessarily to proclaim it as the highest manifestation of<lb facs="P4_TL00012"/>art. If we say that the lyric equals is, we can still say that the full develop<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00013"/>ment of art equals a sentence, and thereby indicate roughly the relation<lb facs="P4_TL00014"/>of the lyric to more ideological forms. Nor does every sentence require an is.<lb facs="P4_TL00015"/>The verb-quality of the lyric, however, throws criticism back upon the attri<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00016"/>butes of the is that Cummings creates. The most distinguishing attribute of<lb facs="P4_TL00017"/>Cummings' lyricism is its grace. And grace again is unanalyzable and inde<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00018"/>finable. Even Poe, could not crystatize it. Of grace, he wrote, " perhaps the<lb facs="P4_TL00019"/>elements are a vivid fancy and a quick sense of the proportionate. Grace,<lb facs="P4_TL00020"/>however, may be most satisfactorily defined as 'a term applied, in despair, to<lb facs="P4_TL00021"/>that class of the impressions of Beauty which admit of no analysis. ' ".<lb facs="P4_TL00022"/>When we attack Cummings' originality, we can, however, proceed<lb facs="P4_TL00023"/>further by quoting from Poe again " My first object (as usual) was original<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00024"/>ity. The extent to which this has been neglected in versification, is one of<lb facs="P4_TL00025"/>the most unaccountable things in the world. Admitting that there is little<lb facs="P4_TL00026"/>possibility of variety in mere rhythm, it is still clear that the possible va<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P4_TL00027"/>rieties of metre and stanza are absolutely infinite — and yet, for centuries,<lb facs="P4_TL00028"/>no man, in verse, has ever done, or ever seemed to think of doing, an original<lb facs="P4_TL00029"/>thing. The fact is, that originality (unless in minds of very unusual force) is<lb facs="P4_TL00030"/>by no means a matter, as some suppose, of impulse or intuition. In general,<lb facs="P4_TL00031"/>to be found, it must be elaborately sought, and although a positive merit of<lb facs="P4_TL00032"/>the highest class, demands in its attainment less of invention than negation " .<lb facs="P4_TL00033"/>Today, this statement still covers with all its primal pertinence the majority<lb facs="P4_TL00034"/>of poets. A minority has found in vers libre great possibility of variety in<lb facs="P4_TL00035"/>rhythm and of this minority, Cummings has probably accomplished more<lb facs="P4_TL00036"/>original things in rhythm, metre and stanza than any three other poets com<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>graphical design in every example reinforces his literary content.

It is then a<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>simplification for the sake of pointing an unmistakable finger at emphatic<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>words. E.g.,—<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>to enjoy the composed sudden body atop which always<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>quivers the electric Distinct face hanghtily vital clinched<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>in a swoon of synopsis.<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>2. Commas are used to indicate pauses wherever the poet decides<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>that cadence requires them, even if it involves the separation of words never<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>previously divided in that manner. E.g.,—<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>(if you toss him a coin he will pick it cleverly from, the<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>air and stuff it seriously in, his minute pocket).<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>3. Blank space is often used to isolate a word or words in a naked<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>■exactitude and emphasis from the rest of the poem. E.g.,—<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>whistles far and wee.<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>4. In order to indicate slow tempo, words are spread apart by hyphens<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>or spaces or have extra letters added.

" Cezanne became truly naif—not by superficially contemplating<lb facs="P9_TL00031"/>and admiring the art of primitive peoples, but by carefully misbelieving and<lb facs="P9_TL00032"/>violently disunderstanding a second hand world ".<lb facs="P9_TL00033"/>(Evidently), we are now entangled in Cummings' temperament as a<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>condition for his work.

Does it not mean<lb facs="P11_TL00022"/>that his first stimulus comes from the emotional and perceptive materials of<lb facs="P11_TL00023"/>his experiences ? And afterwards, he crystallizes them into formal beauties ?<lb facs="P11_TL00024"/>Certainly, that was the proceedure in The Enormous Room. Here Cummings<lb facs="P11_TL00025"/>had a huge mass of experience whose energy demanded expression. This<lb facs="P11_TL00026"/>experience, this dynamic reality, held his major interest. It dictated word<lb facs="P11_TL00027"/>by word the problems of its presentation. Whereas a form-first, content-second,<lb facs="P11_TL00028"/>writer, although he started with this initial experience, would very soon shift<lb facs="P11_TL00029"/>his major interest to his presentation problems, would play loose and fast<lb facs="P11_TL00030"/>with his initial bits of pure feeling for the sake of his non-representative design.<lb facs="P11_TL00031"/>His pure feelings would be but helpless pawns in the grip of his intellect,<lb facs="P11_TL00032"/>whereas in The Enormous Room we have an intellect performing an efficient<lb facs="P11_TL00033"/>servitude to feeling. In Cummings1 case, neither content nor form, neither the<lb facs="P11_TL00034"/>representative nor the non-representative, overbalance one another.

To my dying day I shall be certain that it<lb facs="P26_TL00011"/>contains 2 sentences, and that it is very beautiful, but I should hate to risk<lb facs="P26_TL00012"/>anything for which I cared much by taking a chance on the number of<lb facs="P26_TL00013"/>lines it has. All this argues (not only against dilettanti compilers of an<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                       <lb facs="P26_TL00014"/>thologies containings modern verse, but also) for and against experiment in<lb facs="P26_TL00015"/>typographical metrical notation. If a poem be beautiful it matters little how<lb facs="P26_TL00016"/>it be printed, yet on the other hand a reader should be permitted to loose<lb facs="P26_TL00017"/>none of its subtle cadencies. Yet, again, is it not as wise to leave one's<lb facs="P26_TL00018"/>minor effects implicit and inherent, limiting one's hypothetical audience to<lb facs="P26_TL00019"/>men of imagination and sense ? Does not Cummings miss at times a forest<lb facs="P26_TL00020"/>for the trees, displaying his minor cadencies to the prejudice of his inclusive<lb facs="P26_TL00021"/>ones ?<lb facs="P26_TL00022"/>I shall not enter the subject after all, at all! Being unlearned in these<lb facs="P26_TL00023"/>matters, I fear least anything I have to say tend to increase the prejudice<lb facs="P26_TL00024"/>of readers rather than to clarify experiment by writers ; and, being unlearn<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                       <lb facs="P26_TL00025"/>ed, I feel keenly the need of an exact metrical notation. Robert Graves in<lb facs="P26_TL00026"/>an engaging little bore of a book of which I forget the name, seeks to<lb facs="P26_TL00027"/>dispose of « free verse » because forsooth metrical verse, like Swinburne's<lb facs="P26_TL00028"/>Hertha, has also no exact means of indicating its essential tempo and stress!<lb facs="P26_TL00029"/>19th Century good usage in spelling and punctuation has deprived us of<lb facs="P26_TL00030"/>many devices free to: Milton, Blake, and Co. Old means of indicating tempo<lb facs="P26_TL00031"/>and stress are now to be recovered with more added. That is fine. There<lb facs="P26_TL00032"/>is one danger. Preoccupied with experiment, blinded by success we may,<lb facs="P26_TL00033"/>like Herrick or Herbert (who, with Josephson, not always gave their poems<lb facs="P26_TL00034"/>oral movements promised the eye) deliver poetry to the tender mercy of<lb facs="P26_TL00035"/>printers; depending upon means not literary but visual, like certain Persians<lb facs="P26_TL00036"/>who are the less worth republication or translation because their reputations<lb facs="P26_TL00037"/>rest quite as much on the beauty of their handwriting as upon the niceness<lb facs="P26_TL00038"/>of their ears or the subtlety of their minds. Impressive as are the methods<lb facs="P26_TL00039"/>of advertisement its motive is essentially unaesthetic.

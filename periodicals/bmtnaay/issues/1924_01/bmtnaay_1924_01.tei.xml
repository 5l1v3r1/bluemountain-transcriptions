Primitive, lyrical, adolescent was our<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>spiritual impulse; and were our spiritual leaders. The<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>men in whose lives or works revolt from the material<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>fixities was best incarnate, appeal to a creative life most<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>eloquent and implicit, were the paramount figures. This<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>explains the emergence of the Chicago Group in whom<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>the note of protest and the paean call to "life" were<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>simplified and lovely.

Mr. Littell declared at the outset and again<lb facs="P20_TL00024"/>mid-way that he did not "really understand what he<lb facs="P20_TL00025"/>(Frank) was after,"and "nothing would induce me to<lb facs="P20_TL00026"/>re-read the book (Rahab) in order to find out," thereby<lb facs="P20_TL00027"/>convicting himself of a refusal to prepare thoroughly on<lb facs="P20_TL00028"/>a topic to which his reactions were cloudy.

To what branch of positivism does he<lb facs="P20_TL00038"/>adhere? Upon what is the mysticism of Waldo Frank<lb facs="P20_TL00039"/>founded?

Especially,<lb facs="P26_TL00004"/>if you had had courage enough to climb inside the<lb facs="P26_TL00005"/>wall.

All this happened,<lb facs="P26_TL00010"/>it is true, before my time; but I did see the house<lb facs="P26_TL00011"/>and the gravel path which led up to it, and I have<lb facs="P26_TL00012"/>heard noises come from it with my own ears. . . .<lb facs="P26_TL00013"/>If I remember rightly, it was constructed of some<lb facs="P26_TL00014"/>dull grey stone, which had been made even duller<lb facs="P26_TL00015"/>by the soot coming from the mills along the river."<lb facs="P26_TL00016"/>In the above quotation kindly notice first of all that<lb facs="P26_TL00017"/>the writer's honesty has proved even greater than his<lb facs="P26_TL00018"/>credulity. It is more than significant that in the very<lb facs="P26_TL00019"/>paragraph which aims to plead for ghosts the author's<lb facs="P26_TL00020"/>characteristic circumstantiality contains the germs of the<lb facs="P26_TL00021"/>rebuttal.

For if the<lb facs="P26_TL00026"/>ghost is the simulacrum of the human, by what logical<lb facs="P26_TL00027"/>step can it be denied the possession of male or female<lb facs="P26_TL00028"/>organs, whichever the case may be?

Yet<lb facs="P26_TL00031"/>there are no more so-called ghosts than there have been<lb facs="P26_TL00032"/>people to contain them. And if the body is rotted, and<lb facs="P26_TL00033"/>the soul is in Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory, what is there<lb facs="P26_TL00034"/>left whereof a ghost could be constructed? Nothing but<lb facs="P26_TL00035"/>the memory of man, which is to say, nothing.

The invention of the<lb facs="P26_TL00039"/>ghost is a mere northern aberration, with an origin that<lb facs="P26_TL00040"/>is easily felt when one considers the blunt mists rising<lb facs="P26_TL00041"/>from our bogs, or if one has happened to observe the<lb facs="P26_TL00042"/>broad blossoms of fog which frequently nose through<lb facs="P26_TL00043"/>our dark forests.

The truth is that these unearthly existences<lb facs="P27_TL00005"/>about us are not ghosts, but ghouls, or demons, devoid<lb facs="P27_TL00006"/>of all this austere, ghastly poetry.

For why, I ask, if the devil's tongue<lb facs="P27_TL00014"/>is rounded or even has that soft amorphousness at the<lb facs="P27_TL00015"/>end which is the property of the tongues of humans and<lb facs="P27_TL00016"/>cattle should we associate the lascivious with those<lb facs="P27_TL00017"/>things which protrude in points?

So I consider this decidedly more pleasant aspect<lb facs="P28_TL00004"/>of the child Argubot, whose father and mother always<lb facs="P28_TL00005"/>told the truth, told the truth so much, in fact, that while<lb facs="P28_TL00006"/>Argubot was still young the King came and had his<lb facs="P28_TL00007"/>mother s ears cut off, while his father was put to death.<lb facs="P28_TL00008"/>Thereafter the boy lived alone with his widowed mother,<lb facs="P28_TL00009"/>who still told the truth even though her husband was<lb facs="P28_TL00010"/>dead and her ears were cut off.<lb facs="P28_TL00011"/>But Argubot never told the truth at all. Once when<lb facs="P28_TL00012"/>he was late for supper, his mother asked him where he<lb facs="P28_TL00013"/>had been, and he said that he had been out with the<lb facs="P28_TL00014"/>ghost of his father riding on the moon. His mother<lb facs="P28_TL00015"/>said that he was untrue, and that he had fallen asleep<lb facs="P28_TL00016"/>m the hay, and called him to be whipped. But Argubot<lb facs="P28_TL00017"/>said that his mother must not whip him, because his<lb facs="P28_TL00018"/>father told him he would be King some day. So that<lb facs="P28_TL00019"/>his mother had to put the whip back behind the stove<lb facs="P28_TL00020"/>unused, for the ghost of his father might have taken the<lb facs="P28_TL00021"/>little boy for a ride on the moon, and she had always<lb facs="P28_TL00022"/>felt that Argubot was going to be King some day. At<lb facs="P28_TL00023"/>other times he told similar perplexing falsehoods.<lb facs="P28_TL00024"/>Until the poor woman didn't know what to do. She<lb facs="P28_TL00025"/>wanted her boy to be honest, like herself and her dead<lb facs="P28_TL00026"/>husband, whom the King had killed; for she didn't<lb facs="P28_TL00027"/>want him to become another untrue King. She puzzled<lb facs="P28_TL00028"/>for many days how that she could prove that her son<lb facs="P28_TL00029"/>was not true, so that she could whip him. Although she<lb facs="P28_TL00030"/>was very poor, she gave a candle to Mother Mary. Then<lb facs="P28_TL00031"/>a plan came to her; but she would have to tell a lie.<lb facs="P28_TL00032"/>She hesitated for a long time, finally deciding that she<lb facs="P28_TL00033"/>must do so for the sake of her son.<lb facs="P28_TL00034"/>She went to a neighbor at the far end of the town,<lb facs="P28_TL00035"/>whose cat had kittens, and asked for one small black<lb facs="P28_TL00036"/>kitten. Then she came home again and called Argubot<lb facs="P28_TL00037"/>to her. "Little son, I have brought you three kittens,<lb facs="P28_TL00038"/>but that you may not get tired of them, you may have<lb facs="P28_TL00039"/>only one of them at a time. But as all the three kittens<lb facs="P28_TL00040"/>are nearly alike, it will be hard to tell them apart. But<lb facs="P28_TL00041"/>if you look into their eyes, you can tell them apart, for<lb facs="P28_TL00042"/>their eyes are different. One is called Big-Eyes, because<lb facs="P28_TL00043"/>the black of bis eyes is always as big as the whole eye; I</ab>

The second is called Little-Eyes, because the<lb facs="P29_TL00006"/>black of his eyes is only a slit; he is a lazy fellow, and<lb facs="P29_TL00007"/>at noontime you will find him stretched in the sun on<lb facs="P29_TL00008"/>the back door-step. The third is called Medium-Sized<lb facs="P29_TL00009"/>Eyes, because the black of his eyes is neither big, nor is<lb facs="P29_TL00010"/>it just a slit; you can play with Medium-Sized Eyes in<lb facs="P29_TL00011"/>the mornings and afternoons, but be careful of him, for<lb facs="P29_TL00012"/>he is the liveliest of the three, and is liable to scratch<lb facs="P29_TL00013"/>you."<lb facs="P29_TL00014"/>But Big-Eyes, Little-Eyes and Medium-Sized Eyes<lb facs="P29_TL00015"/>were all one kitten, although Argubot did not know it.<lb facs="P29_TL00016"/>For at night a cat's eyes are big, and at noon they are<lb facs="P29_TL00017"/>very small, while in the morning and the afternoon they<lb facs="P29_TL00018"/>are neither big nor small. And the widow was sorry<lb facs="P29_TL00019"/>that she had been untrue, but she stood by her plan and<lb facs="P29_TL00020"/>waited to see what would come of it.<lb facs="P29_TL00021"/>The next morning, when they were eating their por<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

And now his mother knew that he was<lb facs="P29_TL00035"/>untrue, and she went behind the stove to get her whip.<lb facs="P29_TL00036"/>But Argubot ran out of the house and became King.<lb facs="P29_TL00037"/>And when he was King, he despatched a messenger<lb facs="P29_TL00038"/>to the south, telling him to bring back a cat with big<lb facs="P29_TL00039"/>eyes, and one with little eyes, and one with medium<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

"Now I pick it up and<lb facs="P30_TL00034"/>its eyes are big. I put it down and pick it up again and<lb facs="P30_TL00035"/>its eyes are little. I put it down and pick it up a third<lb facs="P30_TL00036"/>time, and its eyes are medium-sized.

King Argubot was sure that<lb facs="P31_TL00005"/>this was his mother before him, and he told her who he<lb facs="P31_TL00006"/>was, and stepped down from his throne, and led her<lb facs="P31_TL00007"/>into a great banquet prepared for her.<lb facs="P31_TL00008"/>Soon after this, King Argubot, hearing of a beautiful<lb facs="P31_TL00009"/>princess who was weaving a golden garment of a golden<lb facs="P31_TL00010"/>thread on a golden loom, but who lived in a country<lb facs="P31_TL00011"/>Arery far off, went in search of her to make her Queen,<lb facs="P31_TL00012"/>when at last he found her, she looked upon him and<lb facs="P31_TL00013"/>fainted with love, so that she broke the skein of gold<lb facs="P31_TL00014"/>with which she was weaving. But there was a curse<lb facs="P31_TL00015"/>upon this princess, whereby, if it should ever happen<lb facs="P31_TL00016"/>that this golden thread was broken, she was doomed to<lb facs="P31_TL00017"/>die nine months after that time.<lb facs="P31_TL00018"/>The King and his Queen began wandering to fling off<lb facs="P31_TL00019"/>the curse; by royal decree, thousands of witches and<lb facs="P31_TL00020"/>ugly old women were burned; but the curse could not<lb facs="P31_TL00021"/>be flung off, so that at the predestined date the Queen<lb facs="P31_TL00022"/>died, after giving birth to a Prince, who lived on after<lb facs="P31_TL00023"/>her. King Argubot returned to his own country, and<lb facs="P31_TL00024"/>mourned for five years. Then, finding that his people<lb facs="P31_TL00025"/>were at the mercy of usurers, he had all money-lenders<lb facs="P31_TL00026"/>put to death, and devoted himself to the welfare of his<lb facs="P31_TL00027"/>kingdom, at the same time teaching the young Prince<lb facs="P31_TL00028"/>also to love and protect his subjects.*<lb facs="P31_TL00029"/>So wisely did King Argubot pilot his kingdom that all<lb facs="P31_TL00030"/>who were good became favored and happy, while the<lb facs="P31_TL00031"/>malicious and the scheming among them could not<lb facs="P31_TL00032"/>flourish nor take root, so that finally they crossed the<lb facs="P31_TL00033"/>border into other countries.

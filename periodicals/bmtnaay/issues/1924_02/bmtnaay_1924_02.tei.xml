Furthermore, as I have already inferred, sound<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>as We perceive it, has no existence in space, but only in time, or<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>what we perceive as time; for it is only that which is seen that<lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>can be said to fill space, which is a purely visual concept. But<lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>the visual, if it have existence in space, has also existence in time,<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>and this existence is more evident if the visual perception have<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>motion, which is a relation between space and time, and still<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>more evident if that motion have rhythm, which is time consciously<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>broken up and organized with respect to those existences and their<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>intervals that it contains. Now sound, having existence in time,<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>can also have rhythm. So it follows that whereas the auditory and<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>the visual will have no common ground in that which we know as<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>space, they will have a common ground in that which we know<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>as time, and that common ground is rhythm — the actual rhythm<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>of the thing perceived, and not the rhythm of the words contain<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

If the fusion or intercomment necessary to this existence<lb facs="P17_TL00009"/>be not achieved, the symbolic value of the perception is useless as<lb facs="P17_TL00010"/>the perception is without life. If, however, the perception be given<lb facs="P17_TL00011"/>this existence, the symbolism may augment the emotion of the<lb facs="P17_TL00012"/>image considerably, and the emotion resulting from the symbolism<lb facs="P17_TL00013"/>can scarcely be separated in the mind from the emotion resulting<lb facs="P17_TL00014"/>from the image.

Any fact or object which sums<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>up or evokes any set of conditions or emotions, whatever their<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>nature, is to some extent a symbol. Thus T. S. Eliot s Sweeny is<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>symbolic of a certain type of ugliness, Rachel nee Rabinovitch<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>and the rest are symbolic of certain smaller divisions of that<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>ugliness. Mr. Eliot gives movements to these figures that are very<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>often of a quite impersonal nature — that is, they are movements<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>that are in no wise connected with their ugliness or are presented<lb facs="P17_TL00031"/>with a curious detachment from their ugliness; and these mo<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

That a few<lb facs="P18_TL00013"/>words (such as articles) partake, in their meaning, more of the<lb facs="P18_TL00014"/>nature of a gesture or an indication than of a fact, does not alter<lb facs="P18_TL00015"/>the general truth of the assumption. In some words one will find<lb facs="P18_TL00016"/>that the sound of the word, and the thing for which that word<lb facs="P18_TL00017"/>stands, are perfectly fused, and constitute an image in themselves.<lb facs="P18_TL00018"/>Such words are the nouns, leaves, dresses, dust, breath. The<lb facs="P18_TL00019"/>word, drum, if not quite so perfect a fusion, is very nearly so;<lb facs="P18_TL00020"/>and after noting the sound and meaning qualities of this word,<lb facs="P18_TL00021"/>ccnsider the word, dumb, the sound of which is nearly identical<lb facs="P18_TL00022"/>with that of drum, and the meaning of which, insofar as it is a<lb facs="P18_TL00023"/>word of silence, is the opposite. Here the sound and meaning are<lb facs="P18_TL00024"/>definitely not fused, and a problem is presented to the writer. The<lb facs="P18_TL00025"/>there are words that represent abstractions, whose meanings have<lb facs="P18_TL00026"/>no relationship to anything physical, and so can have no aesthetic<lb facs="P18_TL00027"/>necessity — that is, if the sound of any word can be proven to be<lb facs="P18_TL00028"/>other than accidental. Such a word is, for instance, hypocritic.<lb facs="P18_TL00029"/>Now consider these lines :<lb facs="P18_TL00030"/>Daughters of Time, the hypocritic days,<lb facs="P18_TL00031"/>Muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes,<lb facs="P18_TL00032"/>And marching single in an endless file,<lb facs="P18_TL00033"/>Bring diadems and fagots in their hands.<lb facs="P18_TL00034"/>Dumb, whose meaning is opposed to its sound, fuses its<lb facs="P18_TL00035"/>sound with the two sense-perceptions, muffled and barefoot, and<lb facs="P18_TL00036"/>extends and intensifies these perceptions.

The difficulty with<lb facs="P20_TL00020"/>most of these experimenters up to date, however, is that, having<lb facs="P20_TL00021"/>cast out all other thought from their minds, they cannot cast out<lb facs="P20_TL00022"/>the cliches, the very old sentimentalities, which seem to be so<lb facs="P20_TL00023"/>deeply rooted as to be almost mental reflexes.

And<lb facs="P20_TL00028"/>yet, if we reduce literature to complete abstraction — that is,<lb facs="P20_TL00029"/>sound without meaning — we no longer have literature, but<lb facs="P20_TL00030"/>music, and we must either adopt the notation of music or else<lb facs="P20_TL00031"/>adopt a new system of notation to provide for intonation as well<lb facs="P20_TL00032"/>as vowel and consonant sounds.

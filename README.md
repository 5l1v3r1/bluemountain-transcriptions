# bluemountain-transcriptions
This repository contains TEI-encoded transcriptions of the avant-garde magazines digitized by the Blue Mountain Project.

The transcriptions are organized by Blue Mountain Identifier (bmtnid); the registry mapping these identifiers to titles can be found HERE.

The transcriptions are machine-generated derivatives of METS/ALTO/MODS data produced by docWorks.  The code that generates the derivatives can be found HERE.

## Structure of Derivatives
The transcriptions have three major parts:

1. Descriptive metadata
2. Coordinated OCR
3. Structured content

A complete description of the schema can be found HERE.

## The Pilot Branch
Seven titles were the subject of a pilot project to correct and enhance Blue Mountain's data for an experimental API, Blue Mountain Springs.  The article-level metadata was hand-corrected and structural flaws were repaired.  The source documents were measured and described; when possible, additional publication information was added.
